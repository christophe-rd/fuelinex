	abstract = {Plant phenology, the annually recurring sequence of plant developmental stages, is important for plant functioning and ecosystem services and their biophysical and biogeochemical feedbacks to the climate system. Plant phenology depends on temperature, and the current rapid climate change has revived interest in understanding and modeling the responses of plant phenology to the warming trend and the consequences thereof for ecosystems. Here, we review recent progresses in plant phenology and its interactions with climate change. Focusing on the start (leaf unfolding) and end (leaf coloring) of plant growing seasons, we show that the recent rapid expansion in ground- and remote sensing- based phenology data acquisition has been highly beneficial and has supported major advances in plant phenology research. Studies using multiple data sources and methods generally agree on the trends of advanced leaf unfolding and delayed leaf coloring due to climate change, yet these trends appear to have decelerated or even reversed in recent years. Our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the plant phenology responses to climate warming is still limited. The interactions between multiple drivers complicate the modeling and prediction of plant phenology changes. Furthermore, changes in plant phenology have important implications for ecosystem carbon cycles and ecosystem feedbacks to climate, yet the quantification of such impacts remains challenging. We suggest that future studies should primarily focus on using new observation tools to improve the understanding of tropical plant phenology, on improving process-based phenology modeling, and on the scaling of phenology from species to landscape-level.},

	abstract = {Predicting forest responses to warming climates relies on assumptions about niche and temperature sensitivity that remain largely untested. Observational studies have related current and historical temperatures to phenological shifts, but experimental evidence is sparse, particularly for autumn responses. A 4 year ﬁeld experiment exposed four deciduous forest species from contrasting climates (Liquidambar styraciﬂua, Quercus rubra, Populus grandidentata, and Betula alleghaniensis) to air temperatures 2 and 4 °C above ambient controls, using temperature-controlled open top chambers. Impacts of year-round warming on bud burst (BB), senescence, and abscission were evaluated in relation to thermal provenance. Leaves emerged earlier in all species by an average of 4–9 days at +2 °C and 6–14 days at +4 °C. Magnitude of advance varied with species and year, but was larger for the ﬁrst 2 °C increment than for the second. Effect of warming increased with early BB, favoring Liquidambar, but even BB of northern species advanced, despite temperatures exceeding those of the realized niche. Treatment differences in BB were inadequately explained by temperature sums alone. In autumn, chlorophyll was retained an average of 4 and 7 days longer in +2 and +4 °C treatments, respectively, and abscission delayed by 8 and 13 days. Growing seasons in the warmer atmospheres averaged 5–18 days (E2) and 6–28 days (E4) longer, according to species, with the least impact in Quercus. Results are compared with a 16 years record of canopy onset and offset in a nearby upland deciduous forest, where BB showed similar responsiveness to spring temperatures (2–4 days °CÀ1). Offset dates in the stand tracked August–September temperatures, except when late summer drought caused premature senescence. The common garden-like experiment provides evidence that warming alone extends the growing season, at both ends, even if stand-level impacts may be complicated by variation in other environmental factors.},

	abstract = {Leaf senescence in winter deciduous species signals the transition from the active to the dormant stage. The purpose of leaf senescence is the recovery of nutrients before the leaves fall. Photoperiod and temperature are the main cues controlling leaf senescence in winter deciduous species, with water stress imposing an additional inﬂuence. Photoperiod exerts a strict control on leaf senescence at latitudes where winters are severe and temperature gains importance in the regulation as winters become less severe. On average, climatic warming will delay and drought will advance leaf senescence, but at varying degrees depending on the species. Warming and drought thus have opposite effects on the phenology of leaf senescence, and the impact of climate change will therefore depend on the relative importance of each factor in speciﬁc regions. Warming is not expected to have a strong impact on nutrient proﬁciency although a slower speed of leaf senescence induced by warming could facilitate a more efﬁcient nutrient resorption. Nutrient resorption is less efﬁcient when the leaves senesce prematurely as a consequence of water stress. The overall effects of climate change on nutrient resorption will depend on the contrasting effects of warming and drought. Changes in nutrient resorption and proﬁciency will impact production in the following year, at least in early spring, because the construction of new foliage relies almost exclusively on nutrients resorbed from foliage during the preceding leaf fall. Changes in the phenology of leaf senescence will thus impact carbon uptake, but also ecosystem nutrient cycling, especially if the changes are consequence of water stress.},

	abstract = {Summary
            Leafing‐out of woody plants begins the growing season in temperate forests and is one of the most important drivers of ecosystem processes. There is substantial variation in the timing of leaf‐out, both within and among species, but the leaf development of almost all temperate tree and shrub species is highly sensitive to temperature. As a result, leaf‐out times of temperate forests are valuable for observing the effects of climate change. Analysis of phenology data from around the world indicates that leaf‐out is generally earlier in warmer years than in cooler years and that the onset of leaf‐out has advanced in many locations. Changes in the timing of leaf‐out will affect carbon sequestration, plant–animal interactions, and other essential ecosystem processes. The development of remote sensing methods has expanded the scope of leaf‐out monitoring from the level of an individual plant or forest to an entire region. Meanwhile, historical data have informed modeling and experimental studies addressing questions about leaf‐out timing. For most species, onset of leaf‐out will continue to advance, although advancement may be slowed for some species because of unmet chilling requirements. More information is needed to reduce the uncertainty in predicting the timing of future spring onset.

            The time required for an ecosystem to recover from severe drought is a key component of ecological resilience. The phenology effects on drought recovery are, however, poorly understood. These effects centre on how phenology variations impact biophysical feedbacks, vegetation growth and, ultimately, recovery itself. Using multiple remotely sensed datasets, we found that more than half of ecosystems in mid- and high-latitudinal Northern Hemisphere failed to recover from extreme droughts within a single growing season. Earlier spring phenology in the drought year slowed drought recovery when extreme droughts occurred in mid-growing season. Delayed spring phenology in the subsequent year slowed drought recovery for all vegetation types (with importance of spring phenology ranging from 46\% to 58\%). The phenology effects on drought recovery were comparable to or larger than other well-known postdrought climatic factors. These results strongly suggest that the interactions between vegetation phenology and drought must be incorporated into Earth system models to accurately quantify ecosystem resilience.},

            Most climate change detection and attribution studies have focused on mean or extreme temperature or precipitation, neglecting to explore long-term changes in drought characteristics. Here we provide evidence that anthropogenic forcing has impacted interrelated meteorological drought characteristics. Using SPI and SPEI indices generated from an ensemble of 9 CMIP6 models (using 3 realizations per model), we show that the presence of anthropogenic forcing has increased the drought frequency, maximum drought duration, and maximum drought intensity experienced in large parts of the Americas, Africa, and Asia. Using individual greenhouse gas and anthropogenic aerosol forcings, we also highlight that regional balances between the two major forcings have contributed to the drying patterns detected in our results. Overall, we provide a comprehensive characterization of the influence of anthropogenic forcing on drought characteristics, providing important perspectives on the role of forcings in driving changes in drought events.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Late-spring frost (LSF) is a critical factor influencing the functioning of temperate forest ecosystems. Frost damage in the form of canopy defoliation impedes the ability of trees to effectively photosynthesize, thereby reducing tree productivity. In recent decades, LSF frequency has increased across Europe, likely intensified by the effects of climate change. With increasing warming, many deciduous tree species have shifted towards earlier budburst and leaf development. The earlier start of the growing season not only facilitates forest productivity but also lengthens the period during which trees are most susceptible to LSF. Moreover, recent forest transformation efforts in Europe intended to increase forest resilience to climate change have focused on increasing the share of deciduous species in forests. To assess the ability of forests to remain productive under climate change, dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) have proven to be useful tools. Currently, however, most state-of-the-art DVMs do not model processes related to LSF and the associated impacts. Here, we present a novel LSF module for integration with the dynamic vegetation model Lund–Potsdam–Jena General Ecosystem Simulator (LPJ-GUESS). This new model implementation, termed LPJ-GUESS-FROST, provides the ability to directly attribute simulated impacts on forest productivity dynamics to LSF. We use the example of European beech, one of the dominant deciduous species in central Europe, to demonstrate the functioning of our novel LSF module. Using a network of tree-ring observations from past frost events, we show that LPJ-GUESS-FROST can reproduce productivity reductions caused by LSF. Further, to exemplify the effects of including LSF dynamics in DVMs, we run LPJ-GUESS-FROST for a study region in southern Germany for which high-resolution climate observations are available. Here, we show that modeled LSF plays a substantial role in regulating regional net primary production (NPP) and biomass dynamics, emphasizing the need for LSF to be more widely accounted for in DVMs.},

	abstract = {Spring frosts can defoliate trees, reduce canopy carbon assimilation, and alter interspecific competition dynamics. These events may become more common with climate change, but our understanding of the associated ecological impacts is limited by the stochastic nature of their occurrences. In 2020, a late spring frost defoliated oak (
              Quercus
              spp.), but not co-occurring maples (
              Acer
              spp.) across temperate broadleaf forests of the Hudson Highlands in southern New York State, U.S.A. Defoliation impacted 60\% of this region’s forests and delayed full leaf expansion of oaks by ∼17 days. We used this event as an opportunity to advance understanding of how leaf-level physiology, radial growth, and interspecific competition dynamics of mature trees respond to frost-induced defoliation. We quantified leaf-level photosynthetic capacity, stomatal conductance, and water-use efficiency (WUE), as well as basal area increment of defoliated red oak (
              Q. rubra
              ) trees and non-defoliated red maple (
              A. rubrum
              ) trees in 2020 (“defoliation year”) and 2021 (“reference year”). Oak defoliation provided red maple trees with a competitive edge in terms of photosynthetic capacity early in the growing season. However, the second cohort of red oak leaves that developed following defoliation had photosynthetic capacities that were 3–4 times higher than red maple trees by the second half of the growing season, likely facilitated by higher rates of stomatal conductance. The growing season mean photosynthetic capacities for the defoliation year were significantly higher for red oaks than red maples. Red oak basal area increment tended to be higher than red maple during both the defoliation and reference years. For both species basal area increment was significantly higher during the reference year than defoliation year, but the reasons remain unclear. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that temporal patterns of photosynthesis in temperate broadleaf forests are altered by defoliation events, but enhanced photosynthetic capacities of second cohort leaves can reduce the negative effects of delayed leaf expansion and mitigate competitive advantages conferred to undefoliated co-occurring tree species. We suggest that understanding a tree species’ ability to compensate for frost-induced defoliation is essential to accurately predict effects of extreme climate events on tree competition dynamics and ecosystem processes.},

Here, we analyze LSFs between 1959 and 2017 and the resistance strategies of Northern Hemisphere woody species to infer trees’ adaptations for minimizing frost damage to their leaves and to forecast forest vulnerability under the ongoing changes in frost frequencies. Trait values on leaf-out and leaf-freezing resistance come from up to 1,500 temperate and boreal woody species cultivated in common gardens. We find that areas in which LSFs are common, such as eastern North America, harbor tree species with cautious (late-leafing) leaf-out strategies. Areas in which LSFs used to be unlikely, such as broad-leaved forests and shrublands in Europe and Asia, instead harbor opportunistic tree species (quickly reacting to warming air temperatures). LSFs in the latter regions are currently increasing, and given species’ innate resistance strategies, we estimate that ∼35\% of the European and ∼26\% of the Asian temperate forest area, but only ∼10\% of the North American, will experience increasing late-frost damage in the future. Our findings reveal region-specific changes in the spring-frost risk that can inform decision-making in land management, forestry, agriculture, and insurance policy.},

            Heatwaves exert disproportionately strong and sometimes irreversible impacts on forest ecosystems. These impacts remain poorly understood at the tree and species level and across large spatial scales. Here, we investigate the effects of the record-breaking 2018 European heatwave on tree growth and tree water status using a collection of high-temporal resolution dendrometer data from 21 species across 53 sites. Relative to the two preceding years, annual stem growth was not consistently reduced by the 2018 heatwave but stems experienced twice the temporary shrinkage due to depletion of water reserves. Conifer species were less capable of rehydrating overnight than broadleaves across gradients of soil and atmospheric drought, suggesting less resilience toward transient stress. In particular, Norway spruce and Scots pine experienced extensive stem dehydration. Our high-resolution dendrometer network was suitable to disentangle the effects of a severe heatwave on tree growth and desiccation at large-spatial scales in situ, and provided insights on which species may be more vulnerable to climate extremes.},

                    Recent hot droughts in California resulted in ponderosa pine (
                    Pinus ponderosa
                    ) mortality attributed to drought and western pine beetle (WPB,
                    Dendroctonus brevicomis
                    ). While drought alone can cause tree death, direct warming effects on WPB are a contributing factor. Research on WPB generation timing (voltinism), however, is lacking.
                  
                
                
                  We monitored WPB tree attacks and adult emergence timing at two California sites and developed a degree‐day model from field‐observed data. Historical, contemporary, and future temperatures for several California sites were used with the model to examine trends in WPB voltinism.
                
                
                  Field data showed a single summer and an overwinter generation at a northern California site. As summer temperatures increased beyond 1900–1980 averages, the predicted number of full and partial WPB generations by 2021 had increased from {\textasciitilde}2 annual (one summer and one overwinter) generations historically to {\textasciitilde}2.3 at two northern California sites and from {\textasciitilde}2.3 to {\textasciitilde}3.2 at two warmer California sites.
                
                
                  Historical and contemporary data suggest winter warming was not sufficient for an additional generation overwinter. Instead, increases in generations were driven by summer and fall temperatures.
                
                
                  Unconstrained increases in the number of future annual generations will be limited by complex, but not well understood, WPB thermal adaptations. Increased knowledge of temperature‐driven WPB population growth will improve forest vegetation models aimed at predicting ponderosa pine mortality in a changing climate.},
