% Research questions
% ============================
\subsection {Research questions} %emwJuly1 -- I think 'Tree Rings stuff' should move down and you should replace it with a paragraph on the complexity of measuring growth (and then make sure the sentence before it about your broad thesis goals focuses on growth) and maybe measuring growth with changing growing seasons! This would lead nicely into your research questions 
\begin {enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Fuelinex}: How do extended growing seasons affect tree growth across different species, both immediately (in the same year as the extended season) and in subsequent years?
	\item \textbf {CookieSpotters}: How phenological traits regulate tree growth in urban ecosystems?
\end {enumerate}

% ============================
% Hypothesis
% ============================
\subsection{Hypothesis}
\begin {enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Fuelinex}: Growing season extension modifies a tree’s capacity to sequestrate carbon and nitrogen, and this could lead to increased growth in the following season.
	\item \textbf{Fuelinex}: Species capable of accumulating nutrients after growth cessation while going through leaf senescence might exhibit growth increment in the following growing season
	\item \textbf{CookieSpotters}: The magnitude of the growth response to longer seasons will differ between juvenile and mature trees.
\end {enumerate}

% ============================
% Objectives and outreach
% ============================
\subsection{Objectives and outreach}
\begin {enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Fuelinex}: Assess tree species’ potential to prolong or stretch their activity schedule.
	\item \textbf{Fuelinex}:  Determine whether trees can absorb nutrients beyond their theoretical growing season.
	\item \textbf{Fuelinex}:  Examine if increased carbon pools translate into greater growth increment in the following growing season. 
	\item \textbf{CookieSpotters}: Investigate how the timing of phenological events affects growth across years for juvenile and mature trees
\end {enumerate}

%\section*{Chapter 2.1. Wildchrokie: Phenological observations coupling with tree-ring width measurements for a 6-year common garden experiment} While the assumption that a longer growing season leads to increased growth is an intuitive and common one, recent evidence shows that this may not be the case. 
%How phenological season length relates to growth. This is a major question in fundamental biology, but also critical to forecasts of climate change itself, since most carbon models assume that plants experiencing longer seasons will sequester more carbon, but recent studies have called this assumption into question.

% 2. Tree-ring stuff 
% ============================
%\subsection{Tree rings measurements as a proxy for growth}
%Using tree ring data to investigate the relationship between phenology and growth

%\begin{enumerate}
% 1)
%	\item Triggers and mechanisms behind growth onset, duration and rate.
%Growth onset and duration vary because of inter-annual differences in weather, with cambium reactivation in spring being highly dependent on temperature. 
% 2)
%	\item How radial growth is influenced by extreme weather events and their timing. 
%Growh rate increased by temperature, depends on \textbf{when} it is warmer. 
% Include in main text: Long seasons at low temperature will produce fewer cell rows than at warmer temperature.
% 3) 
%	\item Which is more important? How fast does a tree grow, or how long does it grow for?
%how growth rate may have a more direct influence on tree growth than the growing season length. 
% 4)
%	\item Methods to measure tree growth and why using tree ring images may better capture tree growth response than traditional diameter and height measurements.
% Include in main text: Diameter and height measurements are widely used to assess yearly biomass increment. However, these measurements are punctual and are often the cumulative result of many climatic events and constraints that occur during a tree's lifespan
