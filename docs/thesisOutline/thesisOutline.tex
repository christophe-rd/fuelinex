% Starting the whole thing
\begin{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% 1. CC\Biological systems
\item CC impacts on biological systems and how phenological trends are already shifting with warming temperatures. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Warmer temperature led to earlier spring events for amphibians, birds, butterflies and wild plants (Walther, 2002)
\item Autumn phenological events are delayed, but the trend is not as clear as spring's. We have a good mechanistic understanding of the drivers that lead plants to leaf out early, but we don't for Autumn. \textit{Maybe talk about why the trend isn't clear (e.g. monitoring leaf fall and colouring is hard. Can be highly influenced by a single episode of wind, precipitation or frost (Gunderson, 2012)}  
\item Counterinteraction of winter warming that delays spring phenology because of non-met chilling requirements \textit{don't want to get lost in the weeds here though}
\item Overall, earlier spring and delayed autumn lead to a longer phenological growing season (Korner, 2023 for pheno GS definition).
\item Potential impacts of spring frost. Explain how reliance on photoperiod can be a better strategy to avoid spring frosts. Species that are less photoperiod dependant may be more vulnerable to spring frost.
\item Increased drought events in the summer and how earlier spring might increase water deficit later on in the GS. (Vitasse 2021)
\end{enumerate}

% 2. Tree-ring stuff 
\item Whatever

\begin{enumerate}
\item Talk about cambial phenology
