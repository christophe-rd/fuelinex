\subsection{Climate change impacts on tree phenology}
Research from the past two decades have shown increasing evidence that human activity keeps affecting many worldwide environmental processes. This is shown by the increasing impact of invasive species, their corresponding loss of biodiversity which is furthermore affected by its main driver, habitat loss and framentation. That alone raises major concern and actions have been deployed to mitigate these impacts. Human activity, notably their greenhouse gas emissions may have long-lasting consequences, for which predictions by the IPCC have been overwhelmingly alarming since some of their reports have been shown to have been to pesimistic. Climate change currently holds the status of a scientific consensus i.e. scientifics arounds the world, experts in their domain all agree that climate change happens and the speed and the magnitude at which it happens is caused by human activity. However, how climate change impacts thousands of environmental and social processes worldwide is to be discussed with precaution as attribution of its impacts lacks evidence for the most part.

\textbf{Trends of spring and autumn phenological events and their drivers}
The most frequently observed biological impact of climate change over the past decades are major changes on spring and autumn phenology --- the timing of recurring life history events \cite{parmesan_globally_2003,cleland_shifting_2007,lieth_phenology_1974,woolway_phenological_2021,menzel_european_2006}. Understanding the consequences of these shifts on ecosystems requires understanding how much the growing season has changed \cite{duputie_phenological_2015}. Spring phenological events (e.g. budburst and leafout) have been advancing from 0.5 \cite{wolfe_climate_2005} to 4.2 days/decade \cite{chmielewski_response_2001,fu_recent_2014} and are mainly driven by temperature \cite{chuine_why_2010,cleland_shifting_2007,penuelas_responses_2001}. In contrast, autumn phenology (e.g. budset and leaf colouring) is delayed, though to a much lesser extent than spring \cite{gallinat_autumn_2015,jeong_macroscale_2014}. The drivers regulating autumn phenology are far less understood than those of spring for many reasons. First, autumn phenology has attracted much less attention compared to spring \cite{piao_plant_2019}. Second, the data is often much noisier, since meteorological conditions in the fall can drastically influence the phenology phenomena (e.g. trees going through leaf senescence are subjected to a gradual leaf abscission, and the leaves might be at different abscission stage, but a strong wind spell may trigger leaf drop for all leaves, thus affecting data quality. However, the belief is that autumn phenophases are driven by shortening photoperiod and colder temperatures \cite{cooke_dynamic_2012,flynn_temperature_2018,korner_phenology_2010} and colder temperatures \cite{cooke_dynamic_2012,delpierre_temperate_2016}. Different hypothesis are proposed to explain delayed autumn phenophases. First, warmer autumn temperature may extend the activity of photosynthetic enzymes which could be maintained at a a higher level. Thus, the degradation rate of chlorophyll would decrease and timing of senescence would be delayed (Tao2021Divergent). Another mechanism would be through summer conditions... However, a counterinteractive hypothesis suggests an 
antagonistic effect of warming and brightening---caused by reductions in atmospheric pollution and cloud  cover (Sanchez2015Reassessment)--- on leaf senescence (Wu2021Atmospheric). Brightening accelerates the leaf senescence process and reduces the temperature sensitivity of leaf senescence, counteracting the expected warming-induced delays in leaf senescence. The photo-protection and sink limitation hypothesis provide plausible explanations for the negative effect of radiation on leaf senescence and the declining effect of temperature sensitivity of leaf senescence in response to brightening

\textbf{Evidence of declining sensitivity to warming}
% this section needs some heavy work!
Bud dormancy needs to be broken by exposure to cold temperatures during the dormancy period (chilling).

The advancement of spring phenology that has been observed over the past decades might decelerate and this relates to winter dormancy. In the fall, trees in boreal and temperate forests slowly enter dormancy which is initiated with budset. During this phases, cold hardiness increases which prepares the trees for the upcoming cold temperatures and prevents tissue damage. Then, the trees go through dormancy in the winter, during which a certain duration of chilling temperatures between 0 and 5 °C ---with some interaction with photoperiod for some species---- is necessary for the trees to be ready to accumulate forcing (Vitasse2014TheInteraction). In the late winter and early spring, they go through two forms of deacclimation before the buds are ready to burst (Vitasse2014TheInteraction). Trees require a certain amount of heat (forcing) after they come out of the dormancy period to initiate leaf unfolding in spring. Heat requirement is met sooner in warm springs. However, heat requirement is negatively correlated with chilling (Yongshuo2015Declining), but it is this interaction between chilling and forcing requirements that determines the timing of leaf unfolding. Consequently, a decrease in chilling accumulation could explain the observed weaker spring temperature sensitivities as a decline in the relative importance of warm spring temperatures for spring phenological events in the temperate zone, as other environmental triggers (e.g. winter temperatures that determine "chilling") play a larger role (Wolkovich2021ASimple). 


For an observer it remains hidden whether a plant is in endo- or ecodormancy. To predict phenological events, one needs to account for both, internal and external determinants of dormancy (e.g., Basler \& Körner, 2012, 2014; Lundell et al., 2020). Because the drivers of endodormancy and ecodormancy, i.e., the chilling dose, photoperiod, and thermal forcing, interact non-linearly and species-specific, efforts for a general theory for modelling phenology failed so far (Basler, 2016).

In addition, determining the dormancy of a specific individual is complicated because one needs to account for the internal and external determinants of dormancy which vary by the chilling dose, photoperiod and forcing, interacting non-linearly. A general phylogenetic rule for modelling phenology failed because of these constaints. (***not sure of that) (Basler2016, Korner2023Four).

\textbf{Mechanisms that could limit growth despite having a longer growing season}
Plants seasonal activity has internal and external controls, both determined by environmental conditions (Korner2023Four). Internal controls operate via autonomous clocks, activating genes, regulatory loops, and releasing hormones, often integrating chilling or photoperiod signals. The external controls (often addressed as ‘forcing’) act directly on the rate of development, meristem activity, tissue differentiation and metabolism. Understanding these controls is critical to justify how a plant can adjust they activity schedule to change growth increment under better or worse conditions. 
% reword the the previous sentences as they're copy pasted from korner2023. Just doing this quick and dirty **for now**
In lights of this, I hypothesize two possible drivers that could explain why a longer growing season might not lead to increased growth: external (environmental) \cite{kolar_response_2016} or internal (via physiological constraints)\cite{zohner_effect_2023} limits to growth. 

\textit{External constraints}
The complex nature of climate change makes predicting the external limits to growth hard to quantify at the individual level, as these drivers affect communities as a whole. However, drought, spring frost and heat waves are commonly mentioned as the main extreme events that could limit tree growth under climate change \cite{tyree_xylem_2002, choat_triggers_2018, li_widespread_2023,trenberth_global_2014,intergovernmental_panel_on_climate_change_detection_2014,chiang_evidence_2021,polgar_leafout_2011,reinmann_compensatory_2023} (See tables). Their respective mechanisms, global trend of occurence, consequences and difference among species are describe in Tables ***. \\

\textit{Internal constraints}
As for the internal constraints to growth, recent hypothesis propose that broadleaf deciduous tree species may be sink-saturated, such that longer growing season with more carbon fixation do not necessarily increase growth (Dow2022). This one pathway is directly linked the the internal controls of plant growth, which are under strong genetic control. Many studied showed, that in addition to heigh and diameter growth varying across species, these are also affected locally, where populations from higher altitude or latitude grow less under the same conditions than individuals from lower altitude or latitude. This is further suported by phenological studies showing that growth end arrives earlier from populations of higher latitude, demonstrating local adaptation to potentially avoid fall frost, before nutrient uptake has finished. These trees rely on photoperiod cues for setting buds (stopping height growth). 
% Maybe go towards carbon fertilization: This goes against a long-standing, but recently debunked paradigm of growth stimulated by carbon fertilization (Jiang2020TheFate (notinzotero). 

Growth seasonality has huge consequences on overall annual growth and so are the environemental conditions during these periods. For instance, warming spring temperatures seem to positively affect growth, but recent evidence suggest a shift in this net positive effect near the summer solstice where a
% <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
\textbf{How these shifts translate into effects on trees/forests are not clear}
Shifts in spring and autumn phenology support a long-lasting and intuitive assumption that earlier spring and delayed autumn events lead to longer seasons---and thus increased growth \cite{keenan_net_2014} (Stridbeck2022Partly). However, research from the past three years has cast doubt on this hypothesis \cite{dow_warm_2022,green_limits_2022,silvestro_longer_2023}. Recently, Dow \textit{et al}. (2022) showed that despite an earlier growth onset, neither growth rate nor overall annual increment was increased by longer seasons. This could substantially affect carbon-cycle model projections and thus feedbacks to future climate \cite{richardson_climate_2013,swidrak_comparing_2013}. 
Understanding these findings requires answering why trees do not grow more despite longer growing seasons. ** Carbon allocation in wood is pooly understood and the common linear relationship of wood growth as a function of C assimilation is an important limitation of vegetation models because of the poor understanding of empirical and mechanistic basis (Cabon2022). The debate revolving around whether wood growth is controled via photosynthesis (source limitation) or environmental limitations to cambial cell development (sink limitation) seem to bend toward a sink limitation as a result of recent work. Cambial activity appears to be more sensitive than photosynthesis to a range of enviromental conditions including water, temperature and nutrients (Cabon2022). The decoupling between these two processes suggest that internal constraints to growth might be more prevalent than originally thought.

% <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
\textbf{Growing season shifts and consequences on forest ecosystems and services}
Spring and fall phenological events are shifting with debatable consequences on tree growth. Since cambial activity is highly sensitive to water, temperature and nutrients suggesting a sink limitation to growth, this could have far-reaching consequences given the hard-to-predict future climate change where any of these variables have the potential to have huge amplitude changes. This expected assymetry of environmental changes under climate change makes understanding the internal and external drivers to growth critical. Especially, the capacity to tease appart different biomes---as for example boreal vs tropical forests are expected to react differently---is critical and empirical data coming from experiments, but also from observations are paramount if we want to be able to predict the changes of forest carbon offset from human GHG emissions.

\subsection{Nature of the problem, and how to address it}

\textbf{1.2.1. Past phenological trends don't predict future phenological changes}
"The past is not necessarily a guide to the future, but it does partly help explain the present."
Observed phenological trends in the last decades cannot be used directly to extrapolate future phenological changes because: (1) the mechanisms guiding them aren't clear and (2) phenological responses of trees to warming are very likely to not be linear (Fu2013Sensitivity). Indeed, accurate predictions require an in-depth accurate mechanistic understanding of leaf unfolding process and its sensitivity to environmental drivers, especially to temperature and photoperiod (Fu2013Sensitivity). Therefore, the very foundation of the assumption that longer seasons increase growth may change under future climate change. The well observed and understood advance in spring phenology may be offset by warmer winters and delayed autumns may stop being delayed and instead advance in results to earlier growth cessation of increase summer stress. 

\textbf{1.2.2. The assumption that longer seasons lead to increased growth is called into question}
Recent work demonsration an absence of increased growth despite better environmental conditions introduces a paradox that cast doubts onto an apparent very simple and intuitive positive relationship of longer growing seasons on growth. In lights of this, we need to understand better the drivers regulating growth across biomes, but also within species composing these biomes. There is strong differences in phenology across species and so are their responses to warming. This highlights a weekness of current carbon sequestration models where for a lot of them, all species are pooled in together, which introduces a lot of noise in the data and therefore compromising the accuracy of the model projections. To better understand how different species respond to warming, there are different strategies that can be used. Experiments are paramount to robustly tease apart the external vs internal drivers (e.g. warmer springs from severe drought later in the season---a common co-occurring reality in natural environments) \cite{morin_changes_2010,primack_observations_2015}. This is essential to refine forest carbon sequestration projections \cite{green_limits_2022,cabon_cross-biome_2022}. However, experiments are most often performed on juvenile trees, which are critical for their role in forest regeneration projections, but their responses can hardly be translated to mature trees, which hold the overwhelming carbon biomass proportion of forests \cite{augspurger_differences_2003,silvestro_longer_2023,vitasse_ontogenic_2013}. Leaf phenology through ground-based observations can provide valuable insights into the growth onset and end of trees not suitable for experimental trials since cambial and leaf phenology are closely linked to another. It is to say that knowing when leaves elongate and color, can guide when trees start and stop to grow---fundamental metrics to determine the growing season length. Ground observations has the advantage of providing accurate data of phenological events for specific sites and species. Recently, the widespread use of smart-phones has opened a whole new world of possible phenological through citizen scientitists records of data over much larger areas and for a wider range of species (Piao2019, Dickinson2012, Hufkens2019). While there are drawbacks of these observations (e.g. non-standard protocols, highly uneven spatial-temporal distribution of these observations), these methods have a huge potential to diversify the phenology data. % these few lines shouldn't go here.

\subsection{Complexity of measuring growth and defining growing season length}
First of all, a problem that arises when one tries to quantify how shifting growing seasons affect growth comes from the definition of the growing season itself. Recently, Korner 2023 proposed four definitions adressing this issue: 1. true growin season, based on measurable growth; 2. phenological season, based on visible phenological markers; 3. the productive season, based on primary production and meteorological season, based on envionmental conditions % to finish and how it relates to the following lines:

% below is just a thought I had
One may look at increasing GDD over the last century in result to increasing temperature as a reliable proxy for increasing number of days for trees to grow. However, a fundamental distinction is that there is a theoritical and a "real" period at which trees can grow, which is usually defined through the period between budburst and leaf senesence, highlighting the importance of accurate phenology data. 


What is growth? Wood formation is the major biological prcess by which carbon is allocated and long-term stored in woody plants. Thus, radial growth is driven by the production of xylem and phloem cells by the cambium and the expension of these cells, followed by cell wall formation (Etzold2021Number, *check the following refs:Cuny et al., 2015; Lehnebach et al., 2021; Rathgeber et al., 2016)

The first metric that can be used is the calendar growing season.... Now, models using degree-days are increasing, which have been used for decades in agriculture. These rely on developmental patterns that are based on temperature dependance to estimate a particular ecological process, in my case, tree-ring width. These models describe a particular response variable as a composite of time and temperature as opposed to time alone. This is a partimonious method that often requires only two parameters: daily (*toverify) minimum and maximum temperatures (Moore2014Developmental).  Though this simplicity comes with a drawback of over-simplifying potentially complex developmental processes (Bonhomme2000Bases)
\textbf{1.3.1. Traditional diameter measurements miss the resolution of annual growth increment}
Foresters have measured tree diameter and height for decades to infer allometries that could give them a good estimate of how much wood they could collect in a forest. The widely used method in forestry is to use diameter tape at breast height at punctual time intervals, but the drawbacks are that they can't provide short-term indicators of growth---especially if taken at multiple years intervals--- such that extreme events affecting growth may be missed. This growth data provides insufficient resolution to infer a relationship between growth and environmental conditions. Well-studied dendrochronology methods have been used for decades and served many purposes, such as calibrating radiocarbon methods and understanding Earth's past climate. 

% get this from Helama2023. Moreover, the construction of the terrestrial radiocarbon calibration curve is based on tree-ring dated wood (Reimer et al., 2020), similar to the recent annually-resolved refinements of the curve enabling us to examine regional 14C differences
Now, these methods can be used to understand investigate more precise growth patterns and their relationship with different environmental factors

\textbf{1.3.2. Growth increment needs to incorporate wood density in order to evaluate how much structural carbohydrates were stored within a single year.}

\textbf{1.3.3. Primary and secondary growth do not start and end at the same time}

\textbf{1.3.4. Getting growth temporal resolution is labor-intensive and expensive (e.g. dendrometer costs)}

More specifically: A mechanism for the increase occurence of heat waves is a weakeking of the polar jet stream (important weather factor for middle latitude regions of North America, Europe and Asia) caused by global warming which increases the occurence of stationnary weather, resulting in heavy rain falls or heat waves(Marx2021Heat).  Extreme heat $\rightarrow$ growth either through (1) Directly via cell processes disruption or (2) indirectly via effects of rising leaf-to-air vaport deficit (VPD) (Gagne2020Limited).

Increased temperature leads to reduced photosynthesis which can be attributed to: 
1. Damage to photosynthetic machinery

Summertime extreme temperatures associated with prolonged heat waves, lasting for several weeks, now impact approximately 10\% of land surfaces, up from only 1\% in the 1960s. (Teskey2015Responses).
The more intense and more frequently occurring heat waves cannot be explained solely by natural climate variations and without human-made climate change (Marx2021Heat).

%\section*{Chapter 2.1. Wildchrokie: Phenological observations coupling with tree-ring width measurements for a 6-year common garden experiment} While the assumption that a longer growing season leads to increased growth is an intuitive and common one, recent evidence shows that this may not be the case. 
%How phenological season length relates to growth. This is a major question in fundamental biology, but also critical to forecasts of climate change itself, since most carbon models assume that plants experiencing longer seasons will sequester more carbon, but recent studies have called this assumption into question.

%\subsection{Tree rings measurements as a proxy for growth}
%Using tree ring data to investigate the relationship between phenology and growth

%\begin{enumerate}
% 1)
%	\item Triggers and mechanisms behind growth onset, duration and rate.
%Growth onset and duration vary because of inter-annual differences in weather, with cambium reactivation in spring being highly dependent on temperature. 
% 2)
%	\item How radial growth is influenced by extreme weather events and their timing. 
%Growh rate increased by temperature, depends on \textbf{when} it is warmer. 
% Include in main text: Long seasons at low temperature will produce fewer cell rows than at warmer temperature.
% 3) 
%	\item Which is more important? How fast does a tree grow, or how long does it grow for?
%how growth rate may have a more direct influence on tree growth than the growing season length. 
% 4)
%	\item Methods to measure tree growth and why using tree ring images may better capture tree growth response than traditional diameter and height measurements.
% Include in main text: Diameter and height measurements are widely used to assess yearly biomass increment. However, these measurements are punctual and are often the cumulative result of many climatic events and constraints that occur during a tree's lifespan
