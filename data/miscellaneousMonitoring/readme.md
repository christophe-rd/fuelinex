#### Miscellaneous monitoring

readme file to describe the columns of the miscellaneous monitoring spreadsheet. This is a condensed version of the different problems trees have had so far in 2024.

#### Column Description

##### Regular columns

The number that is before the column description corresponds to the doy at which this monitoring has been done. 

tree_id: tree id

bloc: spatial position in the greenhouse (1,2,3)

treatment: either cool spring, cool fall or nutrient boost

species: species 

##### Specific to miscellaneous monitoring columns

**apical_shoot_dead**: the tree is not dead, but the apical shoot is dead. Leaves have resprouted from the sides of the main trunk or from the ground.  

**chlorosis**: mostly for Quma. Symptoms of chlorosis are mostly established based on the white colour of the leaves. 

**light_stress**: whiteish leaves with brown side, in the result of spring treatment where the light was probably too strong. 

**mildew**: powdery mildew found on the leaves of trees. Mostly for Acne

**sawfly** sawfly catterpillar dammage on some bepas.

### 2025Chltoocomparison.xlsx
Since last fall, two different chl measurement tools were used,,t his file contains measurements for approximately the same leaf at the same place, but measured using both tools, to get an overall chlorophyll convertion factor.

For 290, we monitored bloc 2 for all species, but since acne, prvi and quma have lost most of their leaves, we also monitored all the trees that still had leaves remaining. 

The goal for this 3rd measurement was to get low chl values, when leaves have chl degraded

### tagWeight.xlsx
Selected 2 tags per treatment for quma B2 and weighted them so we can average and remove this value to all trees. Except Prvi cool warm r15.
