\section{ABSTRACT}
Climate change is intensifying extreme weather events, posing significant challenges to urban and forest ecosystems. Rising temperatures, heat waves, and increasing wildfire frequency threaten biodiversity and human well-being. In urban environments, tree cover provides critical services that can help mitigate these threats. Trees help cool local areas, reducing the impact of heat waves, while also sequestering carbon and improving air quality. By leveraging two unique datasets of phenological data from a common garden and a community science program in an urban arboretum in Boston (MA), I showed unexpected results of the absence of growth despite apparent better seasonal conditions. These findings support a recently observed paradox of a non-positive growth trend in response to growin season length, with potentially large consequences for urban forest planning and natural ecosystems in the context of a rapidly changing climate.

My MSc research has broader implications for both British Columbia forests and for environmental justice. For BC forests, my work could provide insights into selecting tree species that will have higher productivity under future climate change. For environmental justice, my work can improve green infrastructure policy to reduce disparities, which are currently high as green infrastructure is extremely poor in low-income and marginalized communities. By recommending climate-resilient species for urban planting to help refine plans to reduce these disparities, my research supports equitable access to green spaces and sustainable forest management practices that integrate both scientific and Indigenous knowledge systems.
