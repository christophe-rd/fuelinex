	abstract = {A delay of leaf senescence resulting from variable fall climate may allow for additional nutrient resorption, and storage within reserve organs. Autumn leaves and reserve organs ({\textless}1 year shoots, {\textgreater}1 year shoots, stem above and below the graft union, the tap root, and fine roots) during dormancy of young peach trees were evaluated following warmer fall temperatures and limited soil moisture on two cultivars (‘Scarletprince’ and ‘Autumnprince’ both on GuardianTM rootstock) over two seasons. Four treatments were established for the two cultivars: (1) well-watered trees (100\% ETc needs) in ambient outdoor temperatures; (2) water deficient trees (50\% ETc needs) in ambient outdoor temperatures; (3) well-watered trees grown within a greenhouse; and (4) water deficient trees within a greenhouse. The greenhouse environment was on average 5°C warmer than the ambient outdoor temperature. Senescence was delayed on greenhouse-grown trees both years with leaf number and area similar in the greenhouse and outdoor environments prior to senescence. Across leaf samples, leaf nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were lower within delayed senescence tree leaves while potassium was lower in leaves experiencing normal senescence. During dormancy, multiple reserve organs showed higher nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in trees with delayed senescence than normal senescence and similar increases were observed in water-deficient trees compared to well-watered trees. Phosphorus and potassium concentrations were also higher in multiple reserve organs within ‘Autumnprince’ trees compared to ‘Scarletprince’ trees. This study suggests variable climate conditions of increased temperatures or reduced soil moisture during autumn resulting in delayed senescence influence the process of nutrient resorption and increase nutrient storage within reserve organs.},

	abstract = {The effects of winter chilling, spring forcing temperature, and photoperiod on spring phenology are well known for many European and North American species, but the environmental cues that regulate the spring phenology of East Asian species have not yet been thoroughly investigated. Here, we conducted a growth chamber experiment to test the effects of chilling (controlled by different lengths of exposure to natural chilling conditions), forcing temperature (12, 15, or 18°C) and photoperiod (14 or 10 h) on first flowering date (FFD) of six woody species (three shrubs and three trees) native to East Asia. The three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) separately for each species showed that the effects of chilling and forcing temperature were significant for almost all species (P {\textless} 0.05). Averaged over all chilling and photoperiod treatments, the number of days until FFD decreased by 2.3–36.1 days when the forcing temperature increased by 3°C. More chilling days reduced the time to FFD by 0.7–26 days, when averaged over forcing and photoperiod treatments. A longer photoperiod could advance the FFD by 1.0–5.6 days, on average, but its effect was only significant for two species (including one tree and one shrub). The effects of forcing temperature and photoperiod interacted with chilling for half of the studied species, being stronger in the low chilling than high chilling treatment. These results could be explained by the theory and model of growing degree-days (GDD). Increased exposure to chilling coupled to a longer photoperiod reduced the GDD requirement for FFD, especially when plants grew under low chilling conditions. However, shrubs (except Viburnum dilatatum) had lower chilling and heat requirements than trees, suggesting that, by leafing out sooner, they engage in a more opportunistic life strategy to maximize their growing season, especially before canopy closure from trees' foliage. Our results confirmed the varying effects of these three cues on the flowering phenology of woody species native to East Asia. In future climate change scenarios, spring warming is likely to advance the spring phenology of those woody species, although the reduced chilling and shorter photoperiod may partly offset this spring warming effect.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing provides spatially and temporally continuous measures of forest reflectance, and vegetation indices calculated from satellite data can be useful for monitoring climate change impacts on forest tree phenology. Monitoring of evergreen coniferous forest is more difficult than monitoring of deciduous forest, as the new buds only account for a small proportion of the green biomass, and the shoot elongation process is relatively slow. In this study, we have analyzed data from 186 coniferous monitoring sites in Sweden covering boreal, southern-boreal, and boreo-nemoral conditions. Our objective was to examine the possibility to track seasonal changes in coniferous forests by time-series of MODIS eight-day vegetation indices, testing the coherence between satellite monitored vegetation indices (VI) and temperature dependent phenology. The relationships between two vegetation indices (NDVI and WDRVI) and four phenological indicators (length of snow season, modeled onset of vegetation period, tree cold hardiness level and timing of budburst) were analyzed. The annual curves produced by two curve fitting methods for smoothening of seasonal changes in NDVI and WDRVI were to a large extent characterized by the occurrence of snow, producing stable seasonal oscillations in the northern part and irregular curves with less pronounced annual amplitude in the southern part of the country. Measures based on threshold values of the VI-curves, commonly used for determining the timing of different phenological phases, were not applicable for Swedish coniferous forests. Evergreen vegetation does not have a sharp increase in greenness during spring, and the melting of snow can influence the vegetation indices at the timing of budburst in boreal forests. However, the interannual variation in VI-values for specific eight-day periods was correlated with the phenological indicators. This relation can be used for satellite monitoring of potential climate change impacts on northern coniferous spring phenology.},

Prior to planting, nursery-produced seedlings were placed in cold storage (−3°C) and root growth potential (RGP) and total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) root reserves were tested at 0, 10, 75 and after 150 (container) and 190 days (BR) of storage. Both container and BR stock had much lower root to shoot ratios (RSRs) and root carbohydrate reserves compared to UR seedlings after 170 days. During storage, root reserves in container stock declined faster than in the BR and UR seedlings. RGP in all nursery stock was the highest after 75 days of storage, while longer storage resulted in shoot dieback and reduced root growth. After the first growing season, UR seedlings were one tenth the size of the nursery stock; however, in the second growing season they had no stem dieback and grew twice the height and stem diameter. The higher RSRs and root reserves in the UR seedlings was likely caused by early bud set in its first year of growth. This suggests that inducing bud set earlier in the growing regime might allow seedlings to increase root mass and carbohydrate reserves.},

	abstract = {Increasingly, trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) is being planted in stressful situations such as forest land reclamation, afforestation and forest restoration in North America. This is due to its fast potential for growth and high resiliency, but its indeterminate growth strategy provides a special challenge in creating suitable planting stock for these sites. Clues from naturally established aspen seedlings suggest that root total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) reserves and root:shoot ratio could be strongly related to subsequent seedling establishment and growth. Carbon allocation in plants is generally partitioned between reserve accumulation and growth and development. Under conditions in controlled nurseries, the allocation of carbohydrates to reserves could be manipulated in order to produce seedlings designed for specific environmental conditions. To manipulate seedling characteristics we attempted to induce premature bud set during nursery culture while allowing continued photosynthesis. Treatments included applying different fertilizer regimes, light intensities, reducing photoperiod and use of a shoot growth inhibitor. The shoot growth inhibitor was the most reliable treatment and resulted in complete bud set, while blackout was successful only when seedlings were grown outside. Low nutrient treatments also resulted in early bud set; however, leaves were abscised much earlier. There was a distinct trade-off between growth and reserve accumulation with the late bud set. A longer period of height growth reduced root and total TNC reserves, while early bud set allowed for continued photosynthesis and produced the highest levels of root and total TNC reserves in seedlings. Increased TNC reserves of aspen planting stock was positively related to height growth after outplanting, with root TNC reserves as high as 33\% of dry weight and root:shoot ratios greater than 2 associated with the best growth.},

	abstract = {Nutrient loading of nursery seedling stock of species with an indeterminate growth strategy is challenging and poorly understood. Here, we explore the use of two potential techniques for nutrient loading of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) seedlings: (1) exponential fertilization and (2) early shoot growth termination in order to divert assimilated nutrients and carbon to storage rather than to growth. In the first study, aspen seedlings were treated with either exponential or constant fertilization rates, both of which supplied the same amount of nutrients over the growing season. Exponential fertilization resulted in overall poor planting stock form (stunted seedling growth and weak root development) and produced only marginal improvements of nutrient status. As a result, the exponential fertilization regime studied cannot be recommended as a treatment for aspen seedlings. In the second study we treated seedlings with a 2 × 2 factorial combination of fertilization and shoot growth inhibitor (SGI) applications with the fertilizer treatments varying in terms of mid-season fertilizer concentrations. Seedlings with SGI application had much higher tissue nutrient and carbon reserve concentrations than seedlings without a SGI application. In addition, nutrient uptake appeared to be more efficient in SGI treated seedlings, which could potentially result in significant reductions of nutrient application rates during aspen seedling production in nurseries. Overall, early shoot growth termination using a SGI appears to be an effective technique to produce nutrient loaded aspen seedlings.},
