	abstract = {Phloem sustains maintenance and growth processes through transport of sugars from source to sink organs. Under low water availability, tree functioning is impaired, i.e., growth/photosynthesis decline and phloem transport may be hindered. In a 3-year throughfall exclusion (TE) experiment on mature European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) we conducted 13CO2 branch labeling to investigate translocation of recently fixed photoassimilates under experimental drought over 2 years (2015 and 2016). We hypothesized (H1) that mean residence time of photoassimilates in leaves (MRT) increases, whereas (H2) phloem transport velocity (Vphloem) decreases under drought. Transport of carbohydrates in the phloem was assessed via δ13C of CO2 efflux measured at two branch positions following 13CO2 labeling. Pre-dawn water potential (ΨPD) and time-integrated soil water deficit (iSWD) were used to quantify drought stress. The MRT increased by 46\% from 32.1 ± 5.4 h in control (CO) to 46.9 ± 12.3 h in TE trees, supporting H1, and positively correlated (P {\textless} 0.001) with iSWD. Confirming H2, Vphloem in 2016 decreased by 47\% from 20.7 ± 5.8 cm h-1 in CO to 11.0 ± 2.9 cm h-1 in TE trees and positively correlated with ΨPD (P = 0.001). We suggest that the positive correlation between MRT and iSWD is a result of the accumulation of osmolytes maintaining cell turgor in the leaves under longer drought periods. Furthermore, we propose that the positive correlation between Vphloem and ΨPD is due to a lower water uptake of phloem conduits from surrounding tissues under increasing drought leading to a higher phloem sap viscosity and lower Vphloem. The two mechanisms increasing MRT and reducing Vphloem respond differently to low water availability and impair trees' carbon translocation under drought.},

Two days after labelling, drought decreased the contribution of recently assimilated C to soil CO(2) efflux by 33\%. *Our study showed that drought reduced the coupling between canopy photosynthesis and belowground processes.

Counter-intuitively, many trees do not die during the drought itself. Indeed, observations globally have documented that trees often grow for several years after drought before mortality. A combination of meta-analysis and tree physiological models demonstrate that optimal carbon allocation after drought explains observed patterns of delayed tree mortality and provides a predictive recovery framework. Specifically, post-drought, trees attempt to repair water transport tissue and achieve positive carbon balance through regrowing drought-damaged xylem. Furthermore, the number of years of xylem regrowth required to recover function increases with tree size, explaining why drought mortality increases with size. These results indicate that tree resilience to drought-kill may increase in the future, provided that CO2 fertilisation facilitates more rapid xylem regrowth.},

	abstract = {Summary Heat waves and droughts are expected to increase in frequency and severity in many regions with future climate change, threatening the survival of a number of forest ecosystems. However, our understanding of the physiological processes and mechanisms underlying drought-induced tree mortality is incomplete. Here, we present results on the physiological response of young Norway spruce trees exposed to lethal drought stress. We applied three levels of drought treatment (control, drying–rewetting, complete drought) and monitored relevant physiological functions and processes of carbon and water relations at high temporal resolution until tree death occurred. Only trees subjected to continuous drought died in our experiment. Trees subjected to drying–rewetting cycles consistently recovered in their ability to transport water, indicating that these trees do not suffer permanent damage to the hydraulic system. In all cases, drought reduced carbon assimilation, caused changes in carbon allocation and appeared to have severely reduced phloem functioning and carbon translocation. Structural growth was sacrificed for carbon investment in maintenance respiration and osmoprotection. Severe drought caused trees to rely on stored carbon reserves but, in contrast to above-ground tissues, only root carbon pools were strongly reduced when trees died. Our results indicate that drought-induced changes in carbon allocation, use and transport differ between above- and below-ground tissues in trees. While root death may have been caused by carbon depletion, this was definitely not the case in above-ground tissues. Our findings indicate that mortality mechanisms are not defined at the organism level but rather within tree compartments.},

While it has become established that storage allocation is unlikely to be a mere overflow process, very little empirical evidence has been produced to support this view, at least not for trees. Here we present the results of an intensively monitored experimental manipulation of whole-tree carbon (C) balance (young Picea abies (L.) H Karst.) using reduced atmospheric [CO2] and drought to reduce C sources. We measured specific C storage pools (glucose, fructose, sucrose, starch) over 21 weeks and converted concentration measurement into fluxes into and out of the storage pool. Continuous labeling ((13)C) allowed us to track C allocation to biomass and non-structural C pools. Net C fluxes into the storage pool occurred mainly when the C balance was positive. Storage pools increased during periods of positive C gain and were reduced under negative C gain. (13)C data showed that C was allocated to storage pools independent of the net flux and even under severe C limitation. Allocation to below-ground tissues was strongest in control trees followed by trees experiencing drought followed by those grown under low [CO2]. Our data suggest that NSC storage has, under the conditions of our experimental manipulation (e.g., strong progressive drought, no above-ground growth), a high allocation priority and cannot be considered an overflow process. While these results also suggest active storage allocation, definitive proof of active plant control of storage in woody plants requires studies involving molecular tools.},

With increasing water stress (occurring more rapidly in larger U. minor), declines in leaf, stem and root R were less pronounced than that in leaf net photosynthetic CO2 uptake (Pn ). Daytime whole-plant carbon gain was negative below -4 and -6 MPa midday xylem water potential in U. minor and Q. ilex, respectively. Relative to controls, seedlings exhibiting shoot dieback suffered c. 80\% loss of hydraulic conductivity in both species, and reductions in NSC concentrations in U. minor. Higher drought-induced depletion of NSC reserves in U. minor was related to higher plant R, faster stomatal closure, and premature leaf-shedding. Differences in drought resistance relied on the ability to maintain hydraulic conductivity during drought, rather than tolerating conductivity loss. Root hydraulic failure elicited shoot dieback and precluded resprouting without root NSC reserves being apparently limiting for R.},

	abstract = {Abstract Plant responses to drought and heat stress have been extensively studied, whereas post-stress recovery, which is fundamental to understanding stress resilience, has received much less attention. Here, we present a conceptual stress-recovery framework with respect to hydraulic and metabolic functioning in woody plants. We further synthesize results from controlled experimental studies following heat or drought events and highlight underlying mechanisms that drive post-stress recovery. We find that the pace of recovery differs among physiological processes. Leaf water potential and abscisic acid concentration typically recover within few days upon rewetting, while leaf gas exchange-related variables lag behind. Under increased drought severity as indicated by a loss in xylem hydraulic conductance, the time for stomatal conductance recovery increases markedly. Following heat stress release, a similar delay in leaf gas exchange recovery has been observed, but the reasons are most likely a slow reversal of photosynthetic impairment and other temperature-related leaf damages, which typically manifest at temperatures above 40 °C. Based thereon, we suggest that recovery of gas exchange is fast following mild stress, while recovery is slow and reliant on the efficiency of repair and regrowth when stress results in functional impairment and damage to critical plant processes. We further propose that increasing stress severity, particular after critical stress levels have been reached, increases the carbon cost involved in reestablishing functionality. This concept can guide future experimental research and provides a base for modeling post-stress recovery of carbon and water relations in trees.},

Current research on the physiological mechanisms underlying drought impacts is focused on the water- and carbon-associated mechanisms. The role of nutrients is notably missing from this research agenda. Here, we investigate what role, if any, forest nutrition plays for survival and recovery of forests during and after drought. High nutrient availability may play a detrimental role in drought survival due to preferential biomass allocation aboveground that (1) predispose plants to hydraulic constraints limiting photosynthesis and promoting hydraulic failure, (2) increases carbon costs during periods of carbon starvation, and (3) promote biotic attack due to low tissue carbon: nitrogen (C : N). When nutrient uptake occurs during drought, high nutrient availability can increase water use efficiency thus minimizing negative feedbacks between carbon and nutrient balance. Nutrients are released after drought ceases, which might promote faster recovery but the temporal dynamics of microbial immobilization and nutrient leaching have a significant impact on nutrient availability. We provide a framework for understanding nutrient impacts on drought survival that allows a more complete analysis of forest ecosystem responses.},

However, its dynamic response to other environmental conditions, e.g., to changes in temperature, is less clear. Here, we investigated the effects of drought, increased temperatures and their combination on transport velocity as well as on distribution of recent photoassimilates for different compounds, such as sugars, starch, organic acids and amino acids. We used a (13)CO(2) pulse-labelling approach and studied the recovery of (13)C in different plant tissues and compounds of beech saplings (Fagus sylvatica L.) during a 9-day chase period. Neither total dry biomass nor dry weights of leaves or roots were affected by drought or increased temperatures. Generally, the fast transfer of recently fixed assimilates from leaves to roots took about 1 day, while (13)C enrichment in soil CO(2) efflux peaked only 2 days after labelling. Increased temperatures prolonged mean transfer times of recent photoassimilates from the leaves to the roots, probably caused by enhanced intermediate storage alongside basipetal transfer, clearly impacting short-term carbon allocation. This temperature effect was seen in the delayed peak in (13)C excess of root sugars, decoupling the roots from the leaves in the short term. On average, ∼40\% of the (13)C label initially present in the plant was recovered in the roots (over all treatment combinations), providing strong evidence for preferred carbon allocation into the roots at the end of the growing season. Root starch was the principal compound for long-term storage of carbon, whereas leaf (transitory) starch was remobilized again after some days, exhibiting the longest mean residence times under dry and warm conditions. These observation clearly point to different functionalities of the same compound (i.e., starch) in different plant tissues and the crucial role of roots for long-term carbon storage.},

Increasing tree mortality driven by drought globally has renewed the interest in how plants regulate allocation of recently fixed C to reserve formation. Three-year-old seedlings of two species (Tilia platyphyllos and Pinus sylvestris) were exposed to two intensities of experimental drought during 10 weeks, and 13 C pulse labelling was subsequently applied with rewetting. Tracking the 13 C label across different organs and C compounds (soluble sugars, starch, myo-inositol, lipids and cellulose), together with the monitoring of gas exchange and C mass balances over time, allowed for the identification of variations in C allocation priorities and tree C balances that are associated with drought effects and subsequent drought release. The results demonstrate that soluble sugars accumulated in P. sylvestris under drought conditions independently of growth trends; thus, non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) formation cannot be simply considered a passive overflow process in this species. Once drought ceased, C allocation to storage was still prioritized at the expense of growth, which suggested the presence of 'drought memory effects', possibly to ensure future growth and survival. On the contrary, NSC and growth dynamics in T. platyphyllos were consistent with a passive (overflow) view of NSC formation.},

	abstract = {Summary Non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) play a crucial role in tree resistance and resilience to drought. Stem sapwood parenchyma is among the largest storage tissue for NSC in mature trees. However, there is a limited mechanistic understanding of how NSC reserves, stem parenchyma abundance, and growth rates are interrelated, and how they respond to changing water availability. We quantified NSC, ray parenchyma abundance and ring width along four successive 5-year radial sapwood segments of the stem of 40 mature Pinus sylvestris trees from a 10-year irrigation experiment conducted at a xeric site in Switzerland. Percentage of ray volume (PERPAR) varied from 3.75 to 8.94\% among trees, but showed low intra-individual variability. PERPAR responded positively to irrigation with a lag of several years, but was unrelated to \%NSC. \%NSC was lower in wider rings. However, wider rings still contained a larger NSC pool that was positively related to next year's ring growth. Our results suggest that stem ray parenchyma does not limit NSC storage capacity, but responds to long-term environmental drivers with years of delay. The observed carbon allocation patterns indicate a prioritization of storage over growth independent of growth conditions, likely as a mechanism to ensure long-term survival. Furthermore, NSC pool size proved to be a determinant for the inter-annual auto-correlation in tree-ring growth. Our study highlights the importance of long-term multi-parameter studies to better understand tree responses to environmental variability at different time-scales.

	abstract = {Significance Climate change increases the frequency of drought events and leads to higher variability in precipitation. Drought impairs rhizosphere (root and the root-associated microbiome) functioning in trees and leads to a reduced assimilate supply belowground. It remains unclear if rhizosphere and thus whole-tree functioning can quickly recover after drought release. We show that rhizosphere metabolic activity in previously drought-exposed 100-y-old Scots pine increased in response to subtle soil moisture increases (induced by light rainfall). As a consequence of this activity change, the belowground allocation of new assimilates was immediately stimulated. Even light rainfall events can lead to a fast recovery of rhizosphere functioning and the increased C and energy demand is instantly met by altered whole-tree assimilate allocation. Drought alters carbon (C) allocation within trees, thereby impairing tree growth. Recovery of root and leaf functioning and prioritized C supply to sink tissues after drought may compensate for drought-induced reduction of assimilation and growth. It remains unclear if C allocation to sink tissues during and following drought is controlled by altered sink metabolic activities or by the availability of new assimilates. Understanding such mechanisms is required to predict forests’ resilience to a changing climate. We investigated the impact of drought and drought release on C allocation in a 100-y-old Scots pine forest. We applied 13CO2 pulse labeling to naturally dry control and long-term irrigated trees and tracked the fate of the label in above- and belowground C pools and fluxes. Allocation of new assimilates belowground was ca. 53\% lower under nonirrigated conditions. A short rainfall event, which led to a temporary increase in the soil water content (SWC) in the topsoil, strongly increased the amounts of C transported belowground in the nonirrigated plots to values comparable to those in the irrigated plots. This switch in allocation patterns was congruent with a tipping point at around 15\% SWC in the response of the respiratory activity of soil microbes. These results indicate that the metabolic sink activity in the rhizosphere and its modulation by soil moisture can drive C allocation within adult trees and ecosystems. Even a subtle increase in soil moisture can lead to a rapid recovery of belowground functions that in turn affects the direction of C transport in trees.},

In this study, a 3-year 100\% rainfall exclusion manipulation experiment was conducted to evaluate the response of NSC dynamics to drought stress in 25-year-old Pinus massoniana leaves and branches. The results showed: (1) compared with the control condition, leaf NSC concentration in the drought treatment increased 90\% in the early stage (days 115–542) (p {\textless} 0.05), and then decreased 15\% in the late stage (days 542–1032), which was attributed to water limitation instead of phenology; (2) the response of leaf NSCs to drought was more significant than branch NSCs, demonstrating a time lag effect; and (3) the response of P. massoniana to mild drought stress was to increase the soluble sugars and starch in the early stage, followed by an increase in soluble sugars caused by decreasing starch in the later stress period. Considering these results, mid-term drought stress had no significant effect on the total NSC concentration in P. massoniana, removing carbon storage as a potential adaptation to drought stress.},

The nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC), mainly sugars and starch, fulfil distinct functional roles, including transport, energy metabolism and osmoregulation, and provide substrates for the synthesis of defence compounds or exchange with symbionts involved in nutrient acquisition or defence. At the whole-plant level, NSC storage buffers the asynchrony of supply and demand on diel, seasonal or decadal temporal scales and across plant organs. Despite its central role in plant function and in stand-level carbon cycling, our understanding of storage dynamics, its controls and response to environmental stresses is very limited, even after a century of research. This reflects the fact that often storage is defined by what we can measure, that is, NSC concentrations, and the interpretation of these as a proxy for a single function, storage, rather than the outcome of a range of NSC source and sink functions. New isotopic tools allow direct quantification of timescales involved in NSC dynamics, and show that NSC-C fixed years to decades previously is used to support tree functions. Here we review recent advances, with emphasis on the context of the interactions between NSC, drought and tree mortality.},

This correlation raises two important questions: (i) to what degree is tree growth limited by C availability; and (ii) is growth limited by concurrent C storage (e.g., as nonstructural carbohydrates, NSC)? To test the relationships between drought, growth and C reserves, we monitored the changes in NSC levels and constructed stem growth chronologies of mature Pinus halepensis Miller trees of three drought stress levels growing in Yatir forest, Israel, at the dry distribution limit of forests. Moderately stressed and stressed trees showed 34 and 14\% of the stem growth, 71 and 31\% of the sap flux density, and 79 and 66\% of the final needle length of healthy trees in 2012. In spite of these large reductions in growth and sap flow, both starch and soluble sugar concentrations in the branches of these trees were similar in all trees throughout the dry season (2-4\% dry mass). At the same time, the root starch concentrations of moderately stressed and stressed trees were 47 and 58\% of those of healthy trees, but never {\textless}2\% dry mass. Our results show that all the studied trees maintain a fairly good coordination between C supply and demand, and even during prolonged drought there is more than one way for a tree to maintain a positive C balance.},

	abstract = {Carbon (C) allocation plays a central role in tree responses to environmental changes. Yet, fundamental questions remain about how trees allocate C to different sinks, for example, growth vs storage and defense. In order to elucidate allocation priorities, we manipulated the whole-tree C balance by modifying atmospheric CO2 concentrations [CO2 ] to create two distinct gradients of declining C availability, and compared how C was allocated among fluxes (respiration and volatile monoterpenes) and biomass C pools (total biomass, nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC) and secondary metabolites (SM)) in well-watered Norway spruce (Picea abies) saplings. Continuous isotope labelling was used to trace the fate of newly-assimilated C. Reducing [CO2 ] to 120 ppm caused an aboveground C compensation point (i.e. net C balance was zero) and resulted in decreases in growth and respiration. By contrast, soluble sugars and SM remained relatively constant in aboveground young organs and were partially maintained with a constant allocation of newly-assimilated C, even at expense of root death from C exhaustion. We conclude that spruce trees have a conservative allocation strategy under source limitation: growth and respiration can be downregulated to maintain 'operational' concentrations of NSC while investing newly-assimilated C into future survival by producing SM.},

Careful evaluation of responses within species, where individuals share broadly similar drought resistance strategies, can provide insight into the relative importance of different traits and processes. We subjected Pinus sylvestris L. saplings to extreme drought (no watering) leading to death in a greenhouse to (i) determine the relative effect of predisposing factors and responses to drought on survival time, (ii) identify and rank the importance of key predictors of time to death and (iii) compare individual characteristics of dead and surviving trees sampled concurrently. Time until death varied over 3 months among individual trees (from 29 to 147 days). Survival time was best predicted (higher explained variance and impact on the median survival time) by variables related to carbon uptake and carbon/water economy before and during drought. Trees with higher concentrations of monosaccharides before the beginning of the drought treatment and with higher assimilation rates prior to and during the treatment survived longer (median survival time increased 25-70 days), even at the expense of higher water loss. Dead trees exhibited less than half the amount of nonstructural carbohydrates (NSCs) in branches, stem and relative to surviving trees sampled concurrently. Overall, our results indicate that the maintenance of carbon assimilation to prevent acute depletion of NSC content above some critical level appears to be the main factor explaining survival time of P. sylvestris trees under extreme drought.},

	abstract = {A 2-year field study was carried out with the balsam fir sawfly, Neodiprion abietis (Harris), on balsam fir, Abies balsamea (L.) Mill., to determine: (1) the temporal patterns of defoliation and foliage weight loss associated with early- and late-larval instars; (2) the losses in branch and tree stem volume growth as a result of defoliation by larvae; and (3) to determine the extent to which individual branches are autonomous, and their utility for predicting stem growth losses due to defoliation. In addition, this study also permitted us to determine the relationships between defoliation or foliage weight and branch and tree stem volume growth. Defoliation, foliage weight loss and larval development occurred more quickly in the first year due to warmer temperatures, but final levels of defoliation and foliage weight loss were similar in both years. Cumulative defoliation levels increased from {\textless}5\% at the beginning of the study to 35 and 63\%, respectively, in fall 1999 and 2000. Defoliation was greatest on 1-year-old foliage in both years and most defoliation and foliage weight loss occurred after the initiation of third-instar. Based upon individual year–volume increment relationships for each branch and tree, mean volume increment loss in 1999 and 2000, respectively, was 20 and 42\% for observation branches and 12 and 35\% for tree stems. Similar growth loss estimates of 12 and 46\%, respectively, for 1999 and 2000, were obtained when comparing the mean specific volume increment for control and observation branches. Foliage weight after sawfly attack was related to branch and stem volume growth, but defoliation was only related to branch volume loss. Although branch and tree stem growth were strongly related, growth losses in a branch were not related to those in a tree stem. Branch removal and measurement is a practical alternative to cutting trees to estimate stem volume growth in balsam fir.},

The standardized precipitation index (SPI), standardized runoff index (SRI) and standardized soil moisture index (SSWI) were used to assess the climate change impact on droughts from meteorological, agricultural, and hydrologic perspectives. Changes in drought severity, duration, and frequency suggest that meteorological, hydrological and agricultural droughts will become more severe, prolonged, and frequent for 2020–2049 relative to 1971–2000, except for parts of northern and northeastern China. The frequency of long-term agricultural droughts (with duration larger than 4months) will increase more than that of short-term droughts (with duration less than 4months), while the opposite is projected for meteorological and hydrological droughts. In extreme cases, the most prolonged agricultural droughts increased from 6 to 26months whereas the most prolonged meteorological and hydrological droughts changed little. The most severe hydrological drought intensity was about 3 times the baseline in general whereas the most severe meteorological and agricultural drought intensities were about 2 times and 1.5 times the baseline respectively. For the prescribed local temperature increments up to 3°C, increase of agricultural drought occurrence is predicted whereas decreases or little changes of meteorological and hydrological drought occurrences are projected for most temperature increments. The largest increase of meteorological and hydrological drought durations and intensities occurred when temperature increased by 1°C whereas agricultural drought duration and intensity tend to increase consistently with temperature increments. Our results emphasize that specific measures should be taken by specific sectors in order to better mitigate future climate change associated with specific warming amounts. It is, however, important to keep in mind that our results may depend on the emission scenario, GCMs, impact model, time periods and drought indicators selected for analysis.},

Here, we use empirical data from 732 locations in 43 countries to estimate the mortality burdens associated with the additional heat exposure that has resulted from recent human-induced warming, during the period 1991–2018. Across all study countries, we find that 37.0\% (range 20.5–76.3\%) of warm-season heat-related deaths can be attributed to anthropogenic climate change and that increased mortality is evident on every continent. Burdens varied geographically but were of the order of dozens to hundreds of deaths per year in many locations. Our findings support the urgent need for more ambitious mitigation and adaptation strategies to minimize the public health impacts of climate change.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims: Within-site comparisons were made of rootstock effects on yield, and chloride and sodium concentrations in petioles, juice and wine of Shiraz and Chardonnay vines at sites with irrigation water salinities (ECiw) ranging from low (0.4 dS/m) to moderate-high (1.8 to 3.3 dS/m). It also compared consistency of yield performance of the various rootstocks with both scions over 8 years at one site with an ECiw of 2.1 dS/m. Methods and Results: Chardonnay and Shiraz on own roots and on Ramsey, 1103 Paulsen, 140 Ruggeri, K51-40, Schwarzmann, 101-14, Rupestris St. George and 1202 Couderc were compared. Ramsey resulted in better yields relative to most of the other rootstocks at three of the four sites for each scion. Exceptions were the low salinity site where Schwarzmann was best with Chardonnay, and Padthaway where 140 Ruggeri was best with Shiraz. Chardonnay wine chloride concentrations were similar to grape juice chloride concentrations, but Shiraz wine chloride concentrations were on average 1.7-fold higher than grape juice chloride. Conclusions: Shiraz on own roots, K51-40 and 1202C rootstocks carry some risk of accumulating unacceptable levels of chloride in grape juice and wine when the salinity of the irrigation water is at moderate to high levels. Rootstocks K51-40 (with Chardonnay and Shiraz) and potentially 101-14 (with Shiraz) should be avoided in situations of long term irrigation with moderate to high salinity water. Significance of the Study: The study identifies rootstocks with acceptable yields and grape juice chloride concentrations for potential use in regions affected by salinity.},

	abstract = {Aims: Rootstocks provide protection against soil-borne pests and are a powerful tool to manipulate growth, fruit composition and wine-quality attributes. The present study aimed to assess the consistency of rootstock effects on the growth and fruit composition of scion varieties and identify scion × rootstock interactions.Methods and results: Vine performance and fruit composition of hot-climate, drip-irrigated, spur-pruned Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz, grafted on seven rootstocks, was assessed over five seasons from 2013 to 2017. Rootstocks included Ramsey, 1103 Paulsen and 140 Ruggeri and four promising selections from the CSIRO rootstock development programme. Vines were trained as quadrilateral cordons on a two-wire vertical trellis of height 1.8 m and 3.0 m row × 1.8 m vine spacing, and irrigated with 5.5–6.0 ML/ha of water each season. The study was conducted with mature vines, established in 2006, as a randomised block design with five replicates. There were significant effects of both variety and rootstock on yield, number of bunches, bunch weight, berry weight (scion only), berries per bunch, pruning weight and the Ravaz Index (yield/pruning weight). Despite identical management practices, there were large differences between scion varieties in key growth characteristics across rootstocks. Chardonnay produced a high yield (mean 25.2 kg/vine) with low pruning weight (2.3 kg/vine) and a high mean Ravaz Index value of 12.1. Shiraz had the highest yield (27.4 kg/vine) with high pruning weight (5.1 kg/vine) and a Ravaz Index of 6.3. Cabernet Sauvignon had the lowest yield (15.9 kg/vine) and highest pruning weight (6.6 kg/vine) and a very low Ravaz Index value of 3.0. Effects of rootstock on growth characteristics were smaller than the effects of variety, with mean yields ranging from 19.5 to 25.9 kg/vine, pruning weights ranging from 3.24 to 6.13 kg/vine and mean Ravaz Index values ranging from 5.54 to 8.63. Each variety was harvested when the mean total soluble solids reached 25.0 °Brix. Significant effects of variety and rootstock on fruit composition, included pH, titratable acidity (scion only), malate, tartrate (scion only), yeast assimilable nitrogen (YAN); and for the red varieties, total anthocyanins (scion only) and phenolic substances (scion only). Significant interactions between scion variety and rootstocks were found for yield, number of bunches, berry weight, pruning weight and Ravaz Index. The effect of rootstock on bunch weight and berries per bunch was consistent across scions. Significant scion × rootstock interactions were also found for pH and YAN. For each variety, significant effects of rootstock on fruit composition were linked to growth characteristics. However, these relationships, based on correlation analyses, varied for each scion.Conclusions: The study has shown that growth characteristics and fruit composition of the major varieties was not consistent across seven rootstock genotypes, as significant scion × rootstock interactions were determined. Hence, different rootstocks may be required for each variety to optimise scion performance and fruit composition. The study has also shown that the new CSIRO rootstock selections, covering a range of vigour classifications, may be useful alternatives to those currently in use by industry.Significance and impact of the study: The study has shown that the performance of scion varieties, and to a lesser degree the fruit composition, is dependent on rootstock choice. The inherent vigour of the scion variety must be considered in rootstock selection. Furthermore, individual scion/rootstock combinations may require specific irrigation, pruning or canopy management to achieve vine balance and optimise fruit and wine composition.},

	abstract = {What is addressed as growing season in terrestrial ecosystems is one of the main determinants of annual plant biomass production globally. However, there is no well-defined concept behind. Here, we show different facets of what might be termed growing season, each with a distinct meaning: (1) the time period during which a plant or a part of it actually grows and produces new tissue, irrespective of net carbon gain (growing season sensu stricto). (2) The period defined by developmental, that is, phenological markers (phenological season). (3) The period during which vegetation as a whole achieves its annual net primary production (NPP) or a net ecosystem production (NEP), expressed as net carbon gain (productive season) and (4) the period during which plants could potentially grow based on meteorological criteria (meteorological season). We hypothesize that the duration of such a ‘window of opportunity’ is a strong predictor for NPP at a global scale, especially for forests. These different definitions have implications for the understanding and modelling of plant growth and biomass production. The common view that variation in phenology is a proxy for variation in productivity is misleading, often resulting in unfounded statements on potential consequences of climatic warming such as carbon sequestration.},

	abstract = {In this review, we examine current techniques and recent advances directed toward understanding cellular mechanisms involved in controlling dormancy in vegetative propagules. Vegetative propagules (including stems, rhizomes, tubers, bulbs, stolons, creeping roots, etc.) contain axillary and adventitious buds capable of producing new stems/branches under permissive environments. Axillary and adventitious buds are distinct in that axillary buds are formed in the axil of leaves and are responsible for production of lateral shoots (branches). Adventitious buds refer to buds that arise on the plant at places (stems, roots, or leaves) other than leaf axils. Both axillary and adventitious buds generally undergo periods of dormancy. Dormancy has been described as a temporary suspension of visible growth of any plant structure containing a meristem (Lang et al. 1987). Dormancy can be subdivided into three categories: (1) ecodormancy-arrest is under the control of external environmental factors; (2) paradormancy-arrest is under the control of external physiological factors within the plant; and (3) endodormancy-arrest is under the control of internal physiological factors. One common feature in all of these processes is prevention of growth under conditions where growth should otherwise continue. There is growing evidence that lack of growth is due to blockage of cell division resulting from interactions between the signaling pathways controlling dormancy and those controlling the cell cycle.},

However, it remains unclear whether leaf-out will continue to advance with further warming because species’ effective chilling temperatures, as well as the amount of chilling time required to break dormancy, are still largely unknown for most forest tree species. Here, we assessed the progress of winter dormancy and quantified the efficiency of different chilling temperatures in six dominant temperate European tree species by exposing 1170 twig cuttings to a range of temperatures from −2°C to 10°C for 1, 3, 6 or 12 wk. We found that freezing temperatures were most effective for half of the species or as effective as chilling temperatures up to 10°C, that is, leading to minimum thermal time to and maximum success of budburst. Interestingly, chilling duration had a much larger effect on dormancy release than absolute chilling temperature. Our experimental results challenge the common assumption that optimal chilling temperatures range c. 4–6°C, instead revealing strong sensitivity to a large range of temperatures. These findings are valuable for improving phenological models and predicting future spring phenology in a warming world.},

	title = {Blossom {Thinning} in {Apple} and {Peach} with an {Essential} {Oil}},
	abstract = {A series of experiments was conducted with apple (Malus ·domestica) and peach [Prunus persica (L.) Batsch] from 2003 to 2008 to evaluate the flower thinning efficacy of eugenol and a eugenol-based essential oil. Flower thinning effects by hand defoliation and alternative chemical agents were compared with eugenol in different years. Eugenol or the eugenol-based contact herbicide Matran 2 EC (or Matratec AG) produced noticeable phytotoxicity to floral parts and exposed leaf tissue within 15 min to 1 h after application and injury was proportional to rate. At the highest rates (8\% and 10\%), eugenol resulted in complete burning of all exposed tissue except bark tissue, in which there were no visible signs of injury. Within 3 to 4 weeks of application, phytotoxicity was difficult to observe even at the higher rates of eugenol. In companion experiments, hand defoliation of young leaves at bloom resulted in abscission of young fruitlets in apple, but not in peach, indicating that eugenol may cause thinning by multiple mechanisms. Ammonium thiosulfate (ATS) [49 LÁha-1 or 6.0\% (v/v)] provided thinning in peach and showed little or no phytotoxicity, but the response was inconsistent. ATS was also inconsistent in thinning apple. The thinning response from monocarbamidedihydrogen sulphate (MCDS; Wilthin) at 3.2\% (v/v) was inconsistent in peach. At the rate used, MCDS caused some phytotoxicity on peach. Applications of 1\% to 2\% eugenol appear promising, but good blossom coverage is critical for thinning. Furthermore, eugenol formulations need improvement to ensure uniform coverage for more predictable thinning. Apple and peach trees normally produce significantly more fruit than the tree can carry to a marketable size crop (Dennis, 2000; Wertheim, 2000). Hand thinning at 35 to 60 d after full bloom is the standard practice to reduce crop load and increase fruit size at harvest. Hand thinning is expensive and, with recent labor shortages, is more problematic for growers to complete in a timely manner. Chemical thinners have long been available and used in apple production (Byers, 2003). Thinning at bloom time results in larger fruit at harvest than achieved with the later hand thinning (Byers and Lyons, 1985). Removing 50\% of peach flowers increased average size of the remaining fruit and increased overall crop value (Myers et al., 2002). Chemical thinning of peach flowers reduced the estimated cost of hand thinning up to \$310 U.S. per ha (Southwick et al.},

	abstract = {Background:
British Columbia, Canada, was impacted by a record-setting heat dome in early summer 2021. Most households in greater Vancouver do not have air conditioning, and there was a 440\% increase in community deaths during the event. Readily available data were analyzed to inform modifications to the public health response during subsequent events in summer 2021 and to guide further research.

Methods:
The 434 community deaths from 27 June through 02 July 2021 (heat dome deaths) were compared with all 1,367 community deaths that occurred in the same region from 19 June through 09 July of 2013–2020 (typical weather deaths). Conditional logistic regression was used to examine the effects of age, sex, neighborhood deprivation, and the surrounding environment. Data available from homes with and without air conditioning were also used to illustrate the indoor temperatures differences.

Results:
A combined index of material and social deprivation was most predictive of heat dome risk, with an adjusted odds ratio of 2.88 [1.85, 4.49] for the most deprived category. Heat dome deaths also had lower greenness within 100 m than typical weather deaths. Indoor temperatures in one illustrative home without air conditioning ranged between 30°C and 40°C.

Conclusions:
Risk of death during the heat dome was associated with deprivation, lower neighborhood greenness, older age, and sex. High indoor temperatures likely played an important role. Public health response should focus on highly deprived neighborhoods with low air conditioning prevalence during extreme heat events. Promotion of urban greenspace must continue as the climate changes.},

In this perspectives article, we recall the need of clear-cut definitions, a consistent terminology and a theoretical framework that permits hypothesis testing. Founded in the ecological niche concept, the application of the fundamental niche edge to treeline permits defining the potential climatic limit of tree growth, while the realized niche edge captures all deviations for reasons related to other, more local, abiotic factors, biotic interactions, disturbances and human interventions. An important point is that a globally common phenomenon calls for a common abiotic driver which is the temperature at the low temperature edge of the niche of the life form tree. We explain why other abiotic factors that may affect the local range limits, such as microclimate, moisture and wind do not devaluate the classical isotherm concept. Our key message is that applying a clearly defined concept of potential treeline, also allows defining deviations from it and explaining the deviations within a reproducible theoretical framework.},

Here we experimentally studied spring and autumn phenology in four temperate trees in response to changes in bud albedo (white-painted vs black-painted buds), light conditions (nonshaded vs c. 70\% shaded), water availability (irrigated, control and reduced precipitation) and nutrients (low vs high availability). We found that higher bud albedo or shade delayed budburst (up to +12 d), indicating that temperature is sensed locally within each bud. Leaf senescence was delayed by high nutrient availability (up to +7 d) and shade conditions (up to +39 d) in all species, except oak. Autumn phenological responses to summer droughts depended on species, with a delay for cherry (+7 d) and an advance for beech (−7 d). The strong phenological effects of bud albedo and light exposure reveal an important role of microclimatic variation on phenology. In addition to the temperature and photoperiod effects, our results suggest a tight interplay between source and sink processes in regulating the end of the seasonal vegetation cycle, which can be largely influenced by resource availability (light, water and nutrients).},

	abstract = {Vegetation phenology is highly sensitive to climate change. Phenology also controls many feedbacks of vegetation to the climate system by influencing the seasonality of albedo, surface roughness length, canopy conductance, and fluxes of water, energy, CO2 and biogenic volatile organic compounds. In this review, we first discuss the environmental drivers of phenology, and the impacts of climate change on phenology, in different biomes. We then examine the vegetation-climate feedbacks that are mediated by phenology, and assess the potential impact on these feedbacks of shifts in phenology driven by climate change. We finish with an overview of phenological modeling and we suggest ways in which models might be improved using existing data sets. Several key weaknesses in our current understanding emerge from this analysis. First, we need a better understanding of the drivers of phenology, particularly in under-studied biomes (e.g. tropical forests). We do not have a mechanistic understanding of the role of photoperiod, even in well-studied biomes. In all biomes, the factors controlling senescence and dormancy are not well-documented. Second, for the most part (i.e. with the exception of phenology impacts on CO2 exchange) we have only a qualitative understanding of the feedbacks between vegetation and climate that are mediated by phenology. We need to quantify the magnitude of these feedbacks, and ensure that they are accurately reproduced by models. Third, we need to work towards a new understanding of phenological processes that enables progress beyond the modeling paradigms currently in use. Accurate representation of phenological processes in models that couple the land surface to the climate system is particularly important, especially when such models are being used to predict future climate.},

	abstract = {We assessed the multidecadal effects of boreal forest fire on surface albedo using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite observations within the perimeters of burn scars in interior Alaska. Fire caused albedo to increase during periods with and without snow cover. Albedo during early spring had a mean of 0.50 ± 0.03 for the first three decades after fire, substantially higher than that observed in evergreen conifer forests (0.34 ± 0.04). In older stands between 30 and 55 years, albedo showed a decreasing trend during early spring, probably from a growing spruce understory that masked surface snow and caused increases in both simple ratio (SR) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI). During summer, albedo decreased by 0.012 ± 0.005 in the year immediately after fire (from 0.112 ± 0.005 to 0.100 ± 0.010). In subsequent years, summer albedo increased rapidly at first and then more gradually, reaching a broad maximum in 20–35 year stands (0.135 ± 0.006). These measurements provide evidence for a well-developed deciduous shrub and tree phase during intermediate stages of succession. Averaged over the first 5 decades, shortwave surface forcing from fires was −6.2 W m−2 relative to an evergreen conifer control and −3.0 W m−2 relative to a control constructed from 2000 to 2003 preburn observations. These forcing estimates had a magnitude substantially smaller than previous estimates and suggest that, at a regional scale, evergreen conifer stand density may be lower than that inferred from chronosequence studies.},

	abstract = {Understanding the variations in spring vegetation phenology associated with preseason climate conditions can significantly improve our knowledge on ecosystem dynamics and biosphere–atmosphere interactions. Recent studies have shown that wet winters can delay the start date of the vegetation growing season (SOS) in the high latitudes. However, associated underlying mechanisms remain unclear due to the lack of observation sites as well as complex interactions between various climate and ecosystem variables. In this study, the impact of winter precipitation on year-to-year variations of the SOS in boreal forests from 1982 to 2005 was investigated. Two experiments were performed using the Community Land Model version 4.5. In the control experiment, observed precipitation was used; in the sensitivity experiment, precipitation in the year 1982 was repeated throughout the period. The SOS in the control experiment shows high temporal correlations with the SOS estimated from the satellite-retrieved leaf area index, indicating that the land model is capable of simulating realistic response of vegetation to interannual climate variability. The effects of winter precipitation on the SOS are examined by comparing the two model experiments for wet- and dry winters. After wet winters, the SOS was delayed by 2.7 days over 70.1\% of the boreal forests than after dry winters; this accounts for 42.5\% of the interannual variation in the SOS. The SOS delay is related to the decrease in the growing degree-days (GDD) based on soil temperatures, suggesting that the effects of heat exposure on vegetation growth is strongly modulated by winter precipitation. The GDD decrease is related to both the increase in snowmelt heat flux and reduced absorption of solar radiation, which are proportional to the amount of winter precipitation and the ratio of short plants to tall trees, respectively. Our results provide a physical basis for the winter precipitation–SOS relationship, suggesting that an increase in winter precipitation can alleviate strong advancing trends in spring vegetation growth in conjunction with global warming even for temperature-limited ecosystems.},

Previous studies have reported the effect of land-use/cover change on the land surface albedo, yet few studies have examined how changed understory and canopy structures derived from reforestation contribute to forest albedos and further influence fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR, a proxy of gross primary productivity). Here we continuously measured canopy effective leaf area index (LAIe) and understory greenness in the temperate secondary forest ecosystem. Albedos in three spectral regions (global solar radiation, SR; photosynthetically active radiation, PAR; near-infrared radiation, NIR) and FAPAR were monitored using the Qingyuan Ker Towers (three towers in a watershed; natural mixed broadleaved forest, T1-MBF; natural Mongolian oak forest, T2-MOF; larch plantation forest, T3-LPF), and their relationships to canopy LAIe and understory greenness were examined. The result showed that SR and NIR albedos of MBF and MOF were greater than those of LPF, and their PAR albedos were comparable. SR and NIR albedos were comparably and positively correlated with canopy LAIe and understory greenness, while PAR albedos were negatively correlated with canopy LAIe and understory greenness. Understory greenness explained 75.6\% of changes in NIR albedo of LPF in the peak growing season, indicating a strong control of understory vegetation on the albedos. In addition, SR albedos were significantly correlated with FAPAR, with stronger correlations in MBF (r = 0.69) and MOF (r = 0.93) than that in LPF (r = 0.3), showing a co-benefit of carbon uptake and albedo in broadleaved stands, but the co-benefit was weakened in coniferous plantation stand. These findings suggested that increasing vegetation green biomass and introduction of broadleaved trees into monocultural coniferous plantation may increase forest albedo and co-benefit of albedo and FAPAR to combat climate warming.},

	abstract = {In temperate forests, autumn leaf phenology signals the end of leaf growing season and shows large variability across tree-crowns, which importantly mediates photosynthetic seasonality, hydrological regulation, and nutrient cycling of forest ecosystems. However, critical challenges remain with the monitoring of autumn leaf phenology at the tree-crown scale due to the lack of spatially explicit information for individual tree-crowns and high (spatial and temporal) resolution observations with nadir view. Recent availability of the PlanetScope constellation with a 3 m spatial resolution and near-daily nadir view coverage might help address these observational challenges, but remains underexplored. Here we developed an integration of PlanetScope with drone observations for improved monitoring of crown-scale autumn leaf phenology in a temperate forest in Northeast China. This integration includes: 1) visual identification of individual tree-crowns (and species) from drone observations; 2) extraction of time series of PlanetScope vegetation indices (VIs) for each identified tree-crown; 3) derivation of three metrics of autumn leaf phenology from the extracted VI time series, including the start of fall (SOF), middle of fall (MOF), and end of fall (EOF); and 4) accuracy assessments of the PlanetScope-derived phenology metrics with reference from local phenocams. Our results show that (1) the PlanetScope-drone integration captures large inter-crown phenological variations, with a range of 28 days, 25 days, and 30 days for SOF, MOF, and EOF, respectively, (2) the extracted crown-level phenology metrics strongly agree with those derived from local phenocams, with a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 4.1 days, 3.0 days and 5.4 days for SOF, MOF, and EOF, respectively, and (3) PlanetScope maps large variations in autumn leaf phenology over the entire forest landscape with spatially explicit information. These results demonstrate the ability of our proposed method in monitoring the large spatial heterogeneity of crown-scale autumn leaf phenology in the temperate forest, suggesting the potential of using high-resolution satellites to advance crown-scale phenology studies over large geographical areas.},

Remote sensing has been playing an important and increasing role in the monitoring and assessment of vegetation phenology. The aim of this review is to critically examine key studies related to remote sensing of vegetation phenology, with a special focus on temperate and boreal forests. Specifically, we focus on how the latest ground, near-surface and aerial data have been used to assess the satellite-derived Land Surface Phenology (LSP) metrics and the agreements that has been achieved in the last 15 years. Results demonstrated that the timing of satellite-derived LSP events can be detected, in the best-case scenarios, with a certainty of around half-week for spring metrics (e.g. Day of Year -DOY- of start of growing season) and around one week for autumn metrics (e.g. DOY of end of growing season). With expected shifts in plant phenology averaging {\textless}1 day per decade, such LSP uncertainties (in terms of absolute phenological dates) could greatly over- or under-estimate these species-level shifts; but the spatial variation in phenology can be consistently monitored. An increasing number of studies have investigated autumn phenology in the last decade, but autumn phenological dates continue to be more challenging to retrieve and interpret than spring dates. Emerging opportunities to further advance remote sensing of forest phenology is presented that includes synergetic use of multiple orbital sensors and its LSP evaluation with data from new sensors at a ground, near-surface and airborne level; yet traditional ground-based observations will continue to be highly useful to accurately record the timing of species-specific phenological events. This review might provide a guide for planning and managing remote sensing of forest phenology.},

Here, we outline the trade-offs between methods (spatial resolution, temporal resolution, cost, data processing), and discuss how their use can be optimised in different environments and for different goals. We also emphasise emerging technologies that will be the focus of monitoring in the years to follow and the challenges of monitoring phenology that still need to be addressed. We conclude that there is a need to integrate studies that incorporate multiple monitoring methods, allowing the strengths of one to compensate for the weaknesses of another, with a view to developing robust methods for upscaling phenological observations from point locations to biome and global scales and reconciling data from varied sources and environments. Such developments are needed if we are to accurately quantify the impacts of a changing world on plant phenology.},

	abstract = {Late frost can cause damage to trees, especially to the developing bud of broadleaf species in spring. Through long-term adaptation, plants adjust leaf phenology to achieve an optimal trade-off between growing season length and frost avoidance. In this study, we aim to assess ecotypic differentiation in leaf development of sugar maple populations planted in a common garden. A total of 272 sugar maple seedlings from 29 Canadian provenances were planted at the northern boundary of the natural range, and the phenological phases of bud and leaf development were monitored during spring 2019. The wide geographical area under evaluation showed a complex seasonal pattern of temperature, with spring warming occurring later in the north and close to the sea. Overall, leaf development lasted between 20 and 36 days, from the end of May to end of June. We observed different timings and rates of leaf development among provenances, demonstrating the occurrence of ecotypes in this species. Minimum April temperatures of the original sites were able to explain such differences, while maximum April temperatures were not significant. Seedlings from sites with colder minimum April temperatures completed leaf development earlier and faster. On average, leaf development diverged by up to 6 days among provenances, with minimum April temperatures ranging from −3 to 3 °C. Our results demonstrated that the avoidance of late spring frost is a driving force of leaf development in sugar maple populations. In the colder sites, the growing season is a limiting factor for tree growth. Thus, when thermal conditions become favorable in spring, an earlier growth reactivation and high metabolic activity ensure a fast leaf emission, which maximizes the period available for photosynthesis and growth. These patterns demonstrate the long-term phenological adaptation of sugar maple populations to local climatic conditions and suggest the importance of frost events for leaf development.},

This study investigated whether phenological metrics derived from a multi-decade remotely sensed imagery time-series could differentiate among grass, evergreen shrub, deciduous, or conifer-dominated replacement pathways. We focused on 10 fires that burned ponderosa pine forests in Arizona and New Mexico, USA before the year 2000. A total of 29 sites with discernable post-fire recovery signals were selected within high-severity burn areas. At each site, we used Google Earth Engine to derive time-series of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) signals from Landsat Thematic Mapper, Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus, and Operational Land Imager data from 1984 to 2017. We aggregated values to 8- and 16-day intervals, fit Savitzky–Golay filters to each sequence, and extracted annual phenology metrics of amplitude, base value, peak value, and timing of peak value in the TIMESAT analysis package. Results showed that relative to post-fire conditions, pre-burn ponderosa pine forests exhibit significantly lower mean NDVI amplitude (0.14 vs. 0.21), higher mean base NDVI (0.47 vs. 0.22), higher mean peak NDVI (0.60 vs. 0.43), and later mean peak NDVI (day of year 277 vs. 237). Vegetation succession pathways exhibit distinct phenometric characteristics as early as year 5 (amplitude) and as late as year 20 (timing of peak NDVI). This study confirms the feasibility of leveraging phenology metrics derived from long-term imagery time-series to identify and monitor ecological outcomes. This information may be of benefit to land resource managers who seek indicators of future landscape compositions to inform management strategies.},

	abstract = {The current carbon supply status of temperate forest trees was assessed by analysing the seasonal variation of non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) concentrations in leaves, branch wood and stem sapwood of 10 tree species (six deciduous broad-leafed, one deciduous conifer and three evergreen conifer trees) in a temperate forest that is approximately 100 years old. In addition, all woody tissue was analysed for lipids (acylglycerols). The major NSC fractions were starch, sucrose, glucose and fructose, with other carbohydrates (e.g. raffinose and stachyose) and sugar alcohols (cyclitols and sorbitol) playing only a minor quantitative role. The radial distribution of NSC within entire stem cores, assessed here for the first time in a direct interspecific comparison, revealed large differences in the size of the active sapwood fraction among the species, reflecting the specific wood anatomy (ring-porous versus diffuse-porous xylem). The mean minimum NSC concentrations in branch wood during the growing season was 55\% of maximum, and even high NSC concentrations were maintained during times of extensive fruit production in masting Fagus sylvestris. The NSC in stem sapwood varied very little throughout the season (cross species mean never below 67\% of maximum), and the small reductions observed were not significant for any of the investigated species. Although some species contained substantial quantities of lipids in woody tissues (‘fat trees’; Tilia, Pinus, Picea, Larix), the lipid pools did not vary significantly across the growing season in any species. On average, the carbon stores of deciduous trees would permit to replace the whole leave canopy four times. These data imply that there is not a lot of leeway for a further stimulation of growth by ongoing atmospheric CO2 enrichment. The classical view that deciduous trees rely more on C-reserves than evergreen trees, seems unwarranted or has lost its justification due to the greater than 30\% increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations over the last 150 years.},

To determine if repeated summer browsing causes a C (source) limitation in trees in the long-term, we analysed the non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) and nitrogen (N) concentrations and pools of Betula pubescens saplings subjected to different clipping treatments (unclipped, 33\% and 66\% shoot removal) for 7 years. 2 The short-term effect of browsing on C allocation was assessed by clipping trees with different browsing histories and analyzing their C and N responses within the same growing season. 3 Long-term repetitive summer browsing significantly decreased sapling growth and soluble sugar (SS) concentrations in fine roots. However, trees subjected to different browsing histories did not change their C partitioning into starch. Although trees with a different browsing history showed differences in the NSC concentrations and pools of leaves, these differences were not maintained through time. 4 Simulated browsing had no significant short-term effect on root C and N pools of birch trees, but it decreased all C pools in leaves, 1-year and current-year stems and the starch and total NSC pools in main stems. 5 We conclude that although browsing may cause a temporary decrease in C pools, B. pubescens trees are able to compensate for such losses and hence are not C-limited in the long-term.},

	abstract = {Temperature can have a profound influence on the optimal laying date of insectivorous passerines by affecting the timing of peaks in spring food abundance. If individuals do not synchronise their reproduction with respect to this food peak, it can have detrimental impacts on their reproductive success relative to well-matched breeders. In a population of Blue Tits studied for over a decade, we find that large between-year variation in the onset of laying is tightly coupled to pre-breeding spring temperatures, and that this population-level advancement in laying date in warmer springs can be completely accounted for by individual plasticity. Notwithstanding substantial plasticity within individuals across years, laying date is highly repeatable, with certain individuals consistently early or late. The substantial repeatability appears underlain by heritable variation for relative laying date (h2 = 0.30 +- 0.18 (SE), although this estimate has large standard error and is not significant. This makes assessment of the potential for evolutionary change in laying date problematic, despite observing strong directional selection favouring early-laying individuals. We found that part of the between individual variation in laying date was explained by the quality of the breeding territory and the age of the breeding female. Ornithologists have long sought to quantify variation in avian life histories, with particularly sophisticated experimental approaches and analyses applied to hole-nesting passerines. Nevertheless, there is still great value in presenting descriptions of long-term trends in life history traits, as has been done for laying date in this paper. Characterising such traits provide a useful baseline that is prescient in the face of a changing climate, which may decouple trophic interactions and reveal heterogeneous responses across populations. It also reinforces the value of replicating results and experiments in a field that is increasingly driven by novelty.},

	abstract = {Direct and indirect species interactions within ecological communities may play a strong role in influencing or maintaining community structure. Complex community interactions pose a major challenge to predicting ecosystem responses to environmental change because predictive frameworks require identification of mechanisms by which community interactions arise. Cavity-nesting communities are well suited for mechanistic studies of species interactions because cavity nesters interact through the creation of and competition for cavity-nest sites. In this study, we use a cavity-nest web as a predictive framework for identifying potential indirect species interactions within a cavity-nesting community. From 2002 to 2005, we monitored abundance and nests of cavity-nesting birds in the longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem. Using a nest-web approach, we identified a potential indirect interaction between the Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis) and large secondary cavity nesters, mediated by the Northern Flicker (Colaptes auratus). We used structural equation modeling to test a path model of this interaction, using cavity excavation and enlargement as mechanisms which drive the relationship between these species. Through experimental manipulation of cavity availability, we blocked links described in our model, confirming cavity creation and enlargement as processes that influence community structure. We found that a single-species management technique could potentially disrupt this indirect relationship by affecting Northern Flicker cavity-excavation behavior. This study is the first demonstration of how experimental cavity manipulation can be used to test inferred processes derived from a nest web and highlights the need to understand how mechanisms underlying species interactions can complicate ecosystem responses to environmental change.},

	abstract = {Rainfall following turtle nest construction has long been believed to increase nest survival by its effects on reducing the location cues used by nest predators. However, it is unclear if this is generally the case and if nesting turtles actively use this mechanism to increase their reproductive fitness by deliberately timing nesting to occur before or during rainfall. To address this question, we reviewed studies that examined freshwater turtle nesting behavior and nest predation rates in relation to rainfall. We supplemented our review with data on rainfall and nesting patterns from a 12-year study of two nesting populations of Ouachita Map Turtles (Graptemys ouachitensis). Our review revealed a diversity of responses in rainfall effects on predation and in the propensity for turtles to nest in association with rain. Our mixed findings could reflect a diversity of species- or population-specific responses, local adaptations, species composition of predator community, confounding abiotic factors (e.g., temperature decreases after rainfall) or methodology (e.g., most studies did not quantify rainfall amounts). Our case study on map turtles found very high yearly predation rates (75–100\%), precluding our ability to rigorously analyze the association between nest predation and rainfall. However, close examination of the exact timing of both rainfall and predation revealed significantly lower predation rates when rain fell within 24 h after nesting, indicating that rainfall during or after nesting may reduce nest predation. Despite this effect, the best fitted model explaining the propensity to nest found that map turtles were more likely to nest after dry days than after days with rainfall, suggesting that rainfall was not a major factor driving turtles to nest in our populations. In both our review and in our map turtle populations there was little evidence that turtles can anticipate rainfall and nest prior to it occurring (e.g., in response to falling barometric pressure).},

The abundance of this resource will be influenced by the rates at which cavities are created and destroyed. We applied the demographic concepts of survival and longevity to populations of tree holes to investigate rates of loss for cavities in three tree species, as well as how characteristics of nest trees, habitat type, and species of excavator affected the persistence of tree cavities in trembling aspen, Populus tremuloides (95\% of cavities were in aspen trees), in interior British Columbia, Canada. By modeling survival of 1635 nesting cavities in aspen over a time span of 16 years, we found that the decay stage of the nest tree was the most important factor determining cavity longevity. Cavities in trees with advanced decay had a relatively short median longevity of 7 years (95\% CI 6-9 years), whereas those in living trees had a median longevity of more than 15 years. We found that cavity longevity was greater in continuous forest than in aspen grove habitat. Interestingly, cavities formed by weak excavators survived as long as those created by Northern Flickers (Colaptes auratus), despite occurring in more decayed tree stems. Thus, weak excavators may be selecting for characteristics that make a tree persistent, such as a broken top. Our results indicate that retention of cavities in large, live aspen trees is necessary to conserve persistent cavities, and that cavity longevity will have a large effect on the structure and function of cavity-using vertebrate communities.},

Despite a high degree of breeding synchrony (mean laying date 5–13 April = ±4 days; 80\% of nests laid within 4.8 days within year), European starlings show strong date-dependent variation in clutch size and productivity, but this appears to be mediated by a different temporal mechanism for integration of supplemental cue (temperature) information. We suggest the relationship between mid-winter temperature and breeding phenology might be indirect with both components correlating with a third factor: temperature-dependent development of the starling's insect (tipulid) prey. Mid-winter temperatures might set the trajectory of growth and final biomass of tipulid larvae, with this temperature cue providing starlings with information on breeding season prey availability (though exactly how remains unknown).},

	abstract = {Network analysis offers insight into the structure and function of ecological communities, but little is known about how empirical networks change over time during perturbations. "Nest webs" are commensal networks that link secondary cavity-nesting vertebrates (e.g., bluebirds, ducks, and squirrels, which depend on tree cavities for nesting) with the excavators (e.g., woodpeckers) that produce cavities. In central British Columbia, Canada, Northern Flicker (Colaptes auratus) is considered a keystone excavator, providing most cavities for secondary cavity-nesters. However, roles of species in the network, and overall network architecture, are expected to vary with population fluctuations. Many excavator species increased in abundance in association with a pulse of food (adult and larval beetles) during an outbreak of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae), which peaked in 2003-2004. We studied nest-web dynamics from 1998 to 2011 to determine how network architecture changed during this resource pulse. Cavity availability increased at the onset of the beetle outbreak and peaked in 2005. During and after the outbreak, secondary cavity-nesters increased their use of cavities made by five species of beetle-eating excavators, and decreased their use of flicker cavities. We found low link turnover, with 74\% of links conserved from year to year. Nevertheless, the network increased in evenness and diversity of interactions, and declined slightly in nestedness and niche overlap. These patterns remained evident seven years after the beetle outbreak, suggesting a legacy effect. In contrast to previous snapshot studies of nest webs, our dynamic approach reveals how the role of each cavity producer, and thus quantitative network architecture, can vary over time. The increase in interaction diversity with the beetle outbreak adds to growing evidence that insect outbreaks can increase components of biodiversity in forest ecosystems at various temporal scales. The observed changes in (quantitative) network architecture contrast with the relatively stable (qualitative) architecture of empirical mutualistic networks that have been studied to date. However, they are consistent with recent theory on the importance of population fluctuations in driving network architecture. Our results support the view that models should allow for the possibility of rewiring (species switching partners) to avoid overestimation of secondary extinction risk.},

At the regional level, Mountain Chickadee densities doubled with increases in budworm and beetle availability, then declined with decreases in beetle availability, despite high budworm supply. At the site level, densities of excavators were the best predictor of site-level variation in Chickadee densities in the following year. During and after the beetle outbreak, Mountain Chickadees used more cavities excavated by Red-breasted Nuthatches Sitta canadensis and Downy Woodpeckers Picoides pubescens, both of which are bark insectivores that increased in densities concomitantly with the beetle outbreak and whose foraging activities may have facilitated the Mountain Chickadees' access to bark beetles. Thus, Mountain Chickadees showed a numerical response to the food pulse at the regional level, but a functional response to the pulse of nesting cavities at the site level. Plasticity in resource selection and heterospecific attraction may allow Mountain Chickadees to respond to resource pulses in highly variable environments.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Woodpeckers are important primary excavators that produce nest-sites that are also used by several other cavity-nesting animals. However, the value of nest sites produced by different woodpecker species for other cavity-nesters is not generally known. We studied old Three-toed Woodpecker Picoides tridactylus cavities to examine their importance for other cavity-nesting forest bird species. Over a 31-year period (1987–2017), we annually monitored the occupancy of 655 cavities excavated by the Three-toed Woodpecker in 86 territories of the species in a 170-km2 area in southern Finland. Eight bird species used old Three-toed Woodpecker cavities for breeding, and the occupancy of these cavities by all secondary users was 21.3\%. The expected mean number of lifetime occupancies by secondary cavity-nesters for a single cavity was 2.03. This is equivalent to a mean of two cavities occupied per territory per year, if we assume that Three-toed Woodpeckers produce a new cavity every year. The actual numbers of annually occupied cavities by secondary cavity-nesters can be substantially lower especially in territories that are not constantly occupied by the Threetoed Woodpecker. Based on the use of old cavities and densities of secondary cavity-nesting bird species, we conclude that cavities made by Three-toed Woodpeckers are most significant for the species itself, which accounted for 23.3\% of nests in old Three-toed Woodpecker cavities. When Three-toed Woodpeckers reused an old cavity rather than occupy a freshly excavated cavity, 93\% of cavities selected were originally excavated by Three-toed Woodpeckers. In addition, old cavities are important for the Pygmy Owl Glaucidium passerinum — up to 26–31\% of breeding attempts were in old Three-toed Woodpecker cavities. The importance of old cavities for other hole-nesting bird species like the Pied Flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca or the Great Tit Parus major was rather minor considering their densities within woodpecker territories.},

We develop a simple model to examine factors that may favour one or the other nesting strategy, assuming a trade off between investment in excavation of a new hole and investment in offspring. Consistent with time and energy costs of excavation, male northern flickers Colaptes auratus that excavated were in better body condition than those that reused cavities, and a greater proportion of second nests were in reused holes. Data for other facultative excavators including woodpeckers, nuthatches and chickadees revealed a general pattern of earlier laying dates and larger clutches in reused compared to freshly excavated holes. We suggest that nest reuse is motivated by multiple causes, but may often be adaptive by offering time and energy savings.},

Although trees and their cavities change as they age, with trees becoming softer and cavities becoming larger, it is not known how their value as nesting resources varies with age. In the context of wildlife and forest management, we investigated the relative value of generating a supply of fresh cavities, which are thought to be of high quality, versus protecting cavities as they age and expand in interior volume. For 21 years (1995–2016), we monitored the formation and occupancy of tree cavities used by {\textgreater}30 species of birds and mammals in interior British Columbia, Canada. Cavity occupancy by secondary users was highest 1 year post-excavation (53\%), then declined to 40\% after 2 years, remained at 33 7\% (SD) between 3 and 16 years of age, and increased to 50\% use from 17–20 years post-excavation. Excavators that reused cavities (woodpeckers [Picidae], nuthatches [Sitta spp.]) strongly selected 1and 2-year-old cavities, large-bodied non-excavators (ducks, raptors, squirrels) selected mid-aged cavities, and mountain bluebirds (Sialia currucoides) and tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) selected most strongly for the oldest cavities. Cavities created in living aspen trees (Populus spp.), especially those excavated by northern flickers (Colaptes auratus), maintained high occupancy by secondary users across cavity age, and provided the bulk of cavities used in this system. Altogether, these results show that a diverse excavator community is needed to generate a supply of fresh cavities in the ecosystem, and retention of the mid-aged and older cavities will help support larger species. 2017 The Wildlife Society.},

	abstract = {Background Examining direct and indirect effects on reproduction at multiple scales allows for a broad understanding of species' resilience to environmental change. We examine how the fecundity of the mountain chickadee (Poecile gambeli), a secondary cavity-nesting, insectivorous bird, varied in relation to factors at three scales: regional weather conditions, regional- and site-level food availability, site-level community dynamics, and nest-level cavity characteristics. We hypothesized that earlier laying dates and higher fecundity (clutch size, nest survival, brood size) would be associated with milder climatic conditions, increased food from insect outbreaks, lower densities of conspecifics and nest predators (red squirrel; Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), and safer (smaller, higher) cavities. Methods We collected data on laying date, clutch size, brood size, nest fate (success/failure), and cavity characteristics from 513 mountain chickadee nests in tree cavities in temperate mixed coniferous-broadleaf forest in interior British Columbia, Canada, from 2000 to 2011. We surveyed annual abundances of mountain chickadees and squirrels using repeated point counts, and mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) and lepidopteran defoliators by monitoring host trees and by using regional-scale aerial overview forest insect survey data. We used weather data (temperature, rain, snow) from a local Environment and Climate Change Canada weather station. We modeled laying date, clutch size, daily nest survival, and brood size as a function of predictors at regional-, site-, and nest-scales. Results and Conclusions Measures of fecundity varied dramatically across years and spatial scales. At the regional (study-wide) scale, chickadees laid earlier and larger first clutches in warmer springs with minimal storms, and daily nest survival (DSR) increased with a 2-year lag in growing season temperature. Despite a doubling of mountain chickadee density that roughly accompanied the outbreaks of mountain pine beetle and lepidopteran defoliators, we found little evidence at the site scale that fecundity was influenced by insect availability, conspecific density, or predator density. At the nest scale, DSR and brood size increased with clutch size but DSR declined with nest cavity size indicating a positive reproductive effect of small-bodied cavity excavators. Double-brooding, rare in chickadees, occurred frequently in 2005 and 2007, coinciding with early breeding, high food availability from insect outbreaks, and warm spring temperatures with 0-1 spring storms. Our results support the idea that fecundity in secondary cavity-nesting species is impacted directly and indirectly by weather, and indirectly through changes in community dynamics (via cavity resource supply). We stress the importance of adopting holistic, community-level study frameworks to refine our understanding of fecundity in opportunistic and climate-sensitive species in future.},

The data include the annual availability and occupancy history of 106 cavities in a 170-km2 area in southern Finland during 1987–2018. The median survival time of a cavity was six years, but there were differences between the various forest types (range six to eight years).

Six bird species used the old cavities for breeding, with the Pied Flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca the dominant species accounting for 53\% of all occupancies. The cavity reuse rate in the Lesser Spotted Woodpecker was 3.6\%. The mean occupancy by secondary cavity-nesting birds in old cavities was 32\%, with a range of 29–36\% across the various forest types. There was a significant negative correlation between annual occupancy rates and the age of the cavity. The first two years of a cavity were found to be the most important for total occupancy and 90\% of occupancies took place before the median age of the cavities.

To examine the role of nest-site availability in limiting cavity-using populations in mature mixed conifer forests in central British Columbia, Canada, we conducted an 11-year before-after control-impact experiment in which we increased nest-site availability via nest box addition. Our 7 sites (3 treatments, 4 controls) had low cavity densities ({\textless}2/ha) prior to treatment and cavity occupation rates were also low ({\textless}10\%/yr), which is a relationship often cited in the literature as evidence of non-limitation in cavity-nesting populations. Following nest box addition at our treatment sites, which tripled the availability of cavities, total density of bird and mammal nests more than tripled. Density of mountain chickadee (Poecile gambeli) nests increased 9-fold on treatment sites and returned to pre-treatment levels following box removal, suggesting that chickadee populations were limited by cavity availability at our study sites. Density of red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) and northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus) nests and roosts also increased significantly at treatment sites following box addition and declined following box removal. We noted little change in chickadee or squirrel nest density at control sites monitored concurrently. Squirrels preferred large-sized over small-sized boxes, and significantly enlarged the entrance areas of small boxes by chewing, suggesting that there may have been a shortage of suitable nest and roost sites for them in our study area. We contend that low cavity occupancy rates may not accurately reflect nest-site availability for cavity nesters in mature forests, and that cavity size may influence the true availability of cavities on the landscape. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.},

	abstract = {Tree cavities are a critical multi-annual resource that can limit populations and structure communities of cavity-nesting vertebrates. We examined the regional and local factors influencing lifetime productivity (number and richness of occupants) of individual tree cavities across two divergent forest ecosystems: temperate mixed forest in Canada and subtropical Atlantic Forest, Argentina. We predicted that (1) species would accumulate more rapidly within cavities in the species-rich system (Argentina: 76 species) than the poorer system (Canada: 31 species), (2) cavity characteristics associated with nest-site selection in short-term studies would predict lifetime cavity productivity, and (3) species would accumulate more rapidly across highly used cavities than across cavities used only once, and in Argentina than in Canada. We monitored and measured nesting cavities used by birds and mammals over 22 breeding seasons (1995-2016) in Canada and 12 breeding seasons (2006-2017) in Argentina. Cavities were used an average of 3.1 times by 1.7 species in Canada and 2.2 times by 1.4 species in Argentina. Species richness within cavities increased with number of nesting events at similar rates in Canada and Argentina, in both cases much slower than expected if within-cavity species assemblages were random, suggesting that lifetime richness of individual cavities is more strongly influenced by local ecological factors (nest site fidelity, nest niche) than by the regional species pool. The major determinant of lifetime cavity productivity was the cavity's life span. We found only weak or inconsistent relationships with cavity characteristics selected by individuals in short-term nest-site selection studies. Turnover among (vs. within) cavities was the primary driver of diversity at the landscape scale. In Canada, as predicted, species accumulation was fastest when sampling across high-use cavities. In Argentina, the rates of species accumulation were similar across high- and low-use cavities, and fastest when both high- and low-use cavities were pooled. These findings imply that biodiversity of cavity nesters is maintained by a mix of long-lived (highly productive, legacy trees) and many high-turnover (single-use, fast decaying) tree cavities. Conservation of both long-lasting and single-use cavities should be incorporated into decisions about stand-level forest management, regional land use policies, and reserve networks.},

	abstract = {While ecosystem engineering is a widespread structural force of ecological communities, the mechanisms underlying the inter-specific associations between ecosystem engineers and resource users are poorly understood. A proper knowledge of these mechanisms is, however, essential to understand how communities are structured. Previous studies suggest that increasing the quantity of resources provided by ecosystem engineers enhances populations of resource users. In a long-term study (1995-2011), we show that the quality of the resources (i.e. tree cavities) provided by ecosystem engineers is also a key feature that explains the inter-specific associations in a tree cavity-nest web. Red-naped sapsuckers ( Sphyrapicus nuchalis ) provided the most abundant cavities (52\% of cavities, 0.49 cavities/ha). These cavities were less likely to be used than other cavity types by mountain bluebirds ( Sialia currucoides ), but provided numerous nest-sites (41\% of nesting cavities) to tree swallows ( Tachycineta bicolour ). Swallows experienced low reproductive outputs in northern flicker ( Colaptes auratus ) cavities compared to those in sapsucker cavities (1.1 vs. 2.1 fledglings/nest), but the highly abundant flickers (33\% of cavities, 0.25 cavities/ha) provided numerous suitable nest-sites for bluebirds (58\%). The relative shortage of cavities supplied by hairy woodpeckers ( Picoides villosus ) and fungal/insect decay ({\textless}10\% of cavities each, {\textless}0.09 cavities/ha) provided fewer breeding opportunities ({\textless}15\% of nests), but represented high quality nest-sites for both bluebirds and swallows. Because both the quantity and quality of resources supplied by different ecosystem engineers may explain the amount of resources used by each resource user, conservation strategies may require different management actions to be implemented for the key ecosystem engineer of each resource user. We, therefore, urge the incorporation of both resource quantity and quality into models that assess community dynamics to improve conservation actions and our understanding of ecological communities based on ecosystem engineering.},

	abstract = {Through physical state changes in biotic or abiotic materials, ecosystem engineers modulate resource availability to other organisms and are major drivers of evolutionary and ecological dynamics. Understanding whether and how ecosystem engineers are interchangeable for resource users in different habitats is a largely neglected topic in ecosystem engineering research that can improve our understanding of the structure of communities. We addressed this issue in a cavity-nest web (1999–2011). In aspen groves, the presence of mountain bluebird (Sialia currucoides) and tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolour) nests was positively related to the density of cavities supplied by northern flickers (Colaptes auratus), which provided the most abundant cavities (1.61 cavities/ha). Flickers in aspen groves provided numerous nesting cavities to bluebirds (66\%) and swallows (46\%), despite previous research showing that flicker cavities are avoided by swallows. In continuous mixed forests, however, the presence of nesting swallows was mainly related to cavity density of red-naped sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus nuchalis), which provided the most abundant cavities (0.52 cavities/ha), and to cavity density of hairy woodpeckers (Picoides villosus), which provided few (0.14 cavities/ha) but high-quality cavities. Overall, sapsuckers and hairy woodpeckers provided 86\% of nesting cavities to swallows in continuous forests. In contrast, the presence of nesting bluebirds in continuous forests was associated with the density of cavities supplied by all the ecosystem engineers. These results suggest that (i) habitat type may mediate the associations between ecosystem engineers and resource users, and (ii) different ecosystem engineers may be interchangeable for resource users depending on the quantity and quality of resources that each engineer supplies in each habitat type. We, therefore, urge the incorporation of the variation in the quantity and quality of resources provided by ecosystem engineers across habitats into models that assess community dynamics to improve our understanding of the importance of ecosystem engineers in shaping ecological communities.},

Aims Patterns of sequential nest-hole use are important in understanding the inter- and intraspecific relationships of hole-nesting birds. We studied the hole reuse at both guild and species level, and examined the characteristics of reused holes. Methods The fieldwork was carried out in a strictly protected area in Mongolia. Occupied nest-holes were searched for all hole-nesting species in two subsequent years. The characteristics of nest-holes and nest trees were recorded. Results Of 105 holes occupied in 2002, 40 (38\%) were reused in the following year. The reuse rate for holes previously used by non-excavators was 48\%, and subsequent occupation was almost exclusively by the same species. Reuse rates for previous woodpecker and Willow Tit Poecile montanus holes were 31\% and 16\%, respectively, and the subsequent users were more frequently a different species. Nuthatches and Coal Tits had the highest propensity to reuse holes. Holes located in living parts of trees were reused more often than those in dead wood. Conclusion The tendency to reuse holes could be influenced by the ability to excavate, the ability to compete for nest-sites, and the quality and abundance of preferred hole type of each bird species. The high reuse rate of certain holes would indicate good qualities and/or more limited availability of such holes. The more stable microclimate and greater protection from predation might account for the frequent reuse of holes in living wood.},

However, whether climate-induced changes in breeding phenology affect individual fitness, and how these changes might therefore influence selection on breeding date remain unresolved. Here, we use a 36-yr dataset from a long-term, individual-based study of House Wrens (Troglodytes aedon) to test whether the timing of avian breeding seasons is associated with annual changes in temperature, which have increased to a small but significant extent locally since the onset of the study in 1980. Increasing temperature was associated with an advancement of breeding date in the population, as the onset of breeding within years was closely associated with daily spring temperatures. Warmer springs were also associated with a reduced incubation period, but reduced incubation periods were associated with a prolonged duration of nestling provisioning. Nest productivity, in terms of fledgling production, was not associated with temperature, but wetter springs reduced fledging success. Most years were characterized by selection for earlier breeding, but cool and wet years resulted in stabilizing selection on breeding date. Our results indicate that climate change and increasing spring temperatures can affect suites of life-history traits, including selection on breeding date. Increasing temperatures may favor earlier breeding, but the extent to which the phenology of populations might advance may be constrained by reductions in fitness associated with early breeding during cool, wet years. Variability in climatic conditions will, therefore, shape the extent to which seasonal organisms can respond to changes in their environment.},

Woodpeckers have the choice of excavating a new hole or reusing an existing one, and this propensity to excavate (e) may affect community dynamics but has rarely been investigated. Using 18 years of data on a population of northern flickers Colaptes auratus, I tested six hypotheses to explain the propensity to excavate (e) in a landscape which experienced two types of disturbance: pine beetles and wildfires. Woodpecker age, breeding experience and mate retention had little influence on e which varied between 13-39\% annually and averaged 23\% for 1843 first nests over the 18 years. Body size and body condition of males and females were not associated with e but rates of excavation declined seasonally, suggesting time rather than energy costs limited excavation effort. Reduced cavity availability mediated through high conspecific density coupled with wildfires triggered relatively high excavation rates, up to 39\% but e decreased to baseline levels three years after the landscape disturbances. Nearly 2/3 of males did not excavate in their lifetime but apparently, e is great enough to balance the average rate of cavity tree loss in this forest which is 11\% annually. Excavation propensity in flickers is flexible, but the birds reduce their work levels if there is a surplus of holes available. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Secondary cavity-nesting birds depend on tree cavities for nesting and roosting, but many studies of these birds are conducted using nest boxes. Implementation of effective conservation strategies for cavity-nesting species such as nest-site supplementation requires careful comparisons of fecundity and other vital rates for birds using both natural and artificial nest site types. We compared breeding phenology, clutch and brood sizes, and fledging success of Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) nesting in tree cavities and nest boxes during 2001–2003 in British Columbia, Canada. Swallows using nest boxes initiated egg-laying and hatched young at approximately the same time as those in tree cavities (2 June, 23 June, respectively). Female Tree Swallows in boxes laid larger clutches (5.9 ± 0.9 eggs, N = 76) than those in tree cavities (4.2 ± 1.6 eggs, N = 67). The mean number of nestlings hatched was greater in nest boxes (5.2 ± 1.1 nestlings, N = 67) than in tree cavities (2.6 ± 2.0 nestlings, N = 58). Pairs in boxes were over twice as successful in producing fledglings (93.4\%; 57 of 61 pairs fledged {\textgreater} 1 young) than those in tree cavities (35.8\%; 19 of 53 pairs). Of those successful nests, pairs nesting in boxes fledged 5.1 ± 1.1 young (N = 57), whereas those in tree cavities fledged 3.5 ± 1.2 young (N = 18). Because cavities in nest boxes averaged 60\% larger in volume and 1.8 cm wider internally than tree cavities, we suggest that increased reproductive output was correlated with boxes enabling a larger clutch size. In previous research, we found that Tree Swallows were a poor competitor with other cavity-nesting passerines for tree cavities. The addition of nest boxes may serve as an effective way to supplement local reproduction for secondary cavity-nesting bird populations by reducing competition for limited nest sites. This is especially true in regions where the availability of natural nesting sites is highly variable, and where species compete with many other cavity-nesting passerines using a similar ecological niche and nesting cavities.},

	abstract = {Many animals require tree cavities for breeding and these sites may be reused by a diversity of secondary cavity nesters over a timespan of decades. It is unknown whether the reuse of holes changes their desirability as nest sites. We hypothesized that some species, “cavity destroyers,” degrade the quality of holes by filling them with coarse nest material or waste whereas excavating species, “cavity cleaners,” might prolong the use of a hole by removing debris or enlarging the hole. Using data gathered during 22 years from a field study in central British Colombia, we analyzed long-term patterns of cavity occupancy in relation to their sequential use by bird and mammal species, grouped by traits. Patterns of cavity occupancy were variable with 49\% of 875 large-sized holes (excavated by northern flickers Colaptes auratus and pileated woodpeckers Dryocopus pileatus) and 19\% of 652 smaller-sized holes incorporating runs of sequential use that lasted to 18 years. About 11\% of large and 25\% of small cavities also had gaps of 3–13 years between occupancies. Mammals, raptors and European starlings, consistent with the hypothesis, were cavity destroyers, occupying cavities as terminal users and before gaps more often than expected by chance. The pattern of occupancy by northern flickers was random in relation to gaps or prior use by other species. Although flickers did not target old holes to clean, neither did they avoid them. Small cavities that were renovated by flickers into larger cavities were reused at twice the rate after renovation. Runs of cavity occupancy that involved only cavity-destroying species were shorter than runs that involved periodic use by flickers, suggesting the woodpecker, through its cleaning and renovation, prolonged the use of such holes. Our study contributes insights on additional ecological factors, namely previous users, that can influence the use and availability of cavities over time.},

	abstract = {An abundant supply of cavity-bearing trees is important for maintaining wildlife communities in harvested forests. During harvesting, suitable trees and cavities are directly removed, and the longevity of cavities in retained trees may be reduced by increased exposure to wind and other disturbance factors. We examined patterns of cavity survival in retained trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) trees in harvested stands compared with those in unharvested mature stands by monitoring the persistence of individual cavities. We followed 930 cavities in 3 harvest treatments for up to 17 years in pre-cut and uncut forest, and up to 13 years post-harvest (reserve patches and dispersed retention), in temperate-mixed forests of interior British Columbia, Canada. Average annual cavity loss rates were 5.6\% in pre-cut and uncut forest, 7.2\% for cavities in trees retained in reserves, and 8.1\% for cavities in retained trees dispersed throughout cuts. Correspondingly, median cavity longevity was 15 years for cavities in pre-cut and uncut forest, 10 years for cavities retained in reserves, and 9 years for those in dispersed retention. Risk of loss increased most for cavities in living trees (factor of 2.17), but we found no detectable difference for cavities in recently dead trees and trees with advanced decay. We suggest retention of a range of aspen size and decay classes to allow for future cavity-tree recruitment in harvested stands. Inclusion of wildlife reserves as part of an overall forest management plan will also help to mitigate the effects of windthrow and maintain long-lived cavity resources required by a large portion of forest wildlife. © 2013 The Wildlife Society},

	abstract = {Resource pulses within structured communities can lead to changes in the ecological roles of community members, particularly for species that exhibit plasticity in resource use. The red-breasted nuthatch Sitta canadensis is a facultative excavating cavity-nester that forages on seeds and insects, thus exhibits plasticity in both nesting habits and diet. In a long-term study of cavity-nesting vertebrates, we used point counts, and nest and vegetation surveys to examine the effects of two resource pulses of mountain pine bark beetle prey Dendroctonus ponderosae and tree cavities via excavator populations, on population densities and cavity reuse of red-breasted nuthatches, from 1997–2006. We observed a doubling in mean nut-hatch densities from 0.12 to 0.24 individuals ha−1 then a collapse later in the decade to 50\% below endemic levels (0.06 individuals ha−1). These regional fluctuations were positively correlated with densities of trees recently infected by bark beetles. Because nuthatches range over large areas in winter, this regional correlation suggests that populations responded to the increase in winter food supply. At the site scale, general linear mixed effects models showed that nuthatch populations increased following years of high densities of downy woodpeckers Picoides pubescens, suggesting that downy woodpeckers were important facilitators, via cavity excavation. Type of nesting cavity used by nuthatches varied during the pulse, such that the use of existing cavities (in lieu of excavation) increased on sites that had harboured downy woodpecker nests in the previous year. We conclude that increased densities of cavity excavators allowed facultative excavators to increase their reuse of cavities, which may have contributed to the dramatic increases in nuthatch populations. However, nuthatch populations collapsed after the boom suggesting that this dual resource pulse may have destabilized populations by enabling densities to reach unsustainable levels. Thus, plasticity in resource use can have serious costs as well as benefits.},

We examined the relationship between Starling nest density and the fecundity of two native secondary cavity-using passerines, Mountain Bluebird Sialia currucoides and Tree Swallow Tachycineta bicolor. We monitored a total of 622 nests (approximately equal numbers for each of the three species) in woodpecker-excavated and naturally occurring cavities in 29 small forest groves in central British Columbia, Canada, between 2000 and 2009. The dimensions of cavities used and the timing of nest initiation overlapped for all species, although Starlings initiated clutches earliest. Mixed-effects models were used to assess whether nest abundance, clutch size or nest success were affected directly by Starling nest abundance, or indirectly via a shift in cavity selection or timing of breeding. Starlings and Mountain Bluebirds showed inverse trends in nest abundance. Mountain Bluebird clutch sizes were smaller if they were initiated later in the breeding season. There was weak evidence that Tree Swallow clutch size decreased with cavity depth when Starling nests were abundant, and increased with cavity depth where there were few Starling nests. We conclude that despite the aggressive nature of this exotic cavity-nester, the influence of Starlings on native secondary cavity-nesting passerines is modest where cavities are abundant.},

In cavity-nesting vertebrate communities, where the availability of tree cavities can limit reproduction and the reuse of cavities can increase nest predation by squirrels, excavators may maximize their fecundity by creating new cavities in competitor- and predator-rich habitats that undergo food pulses. Th e reproductive cost associated with excavation (i.e. increased energy allocation early in the breeding season that often delays laying and thereby reduces clutch size), may be reduced if food pulses allow for a longer breeding season and larger clutches. A large-scale mountain pine beetle Dendroctonus ponderosae outbreak that occurred during our long-term study (1995 – 2009) provided a natural food supplementation experiment across 27 sites in British Columbia, Canada. We examined the eff ects of a reduction in food constraints accompanied with increases in excavation rates, conspecifi c density and nest predation risk on the fecundity of a facultative excavator, the red-breasted nuthatch Sitta canadensis . We found a total of 420 nests in tree cavities. Nuthatch clutch sizes ranged from two to nine eggs, and broods from one to nine fl edglings per nest. Later clutches were larger at sites and in years with high beetle abundance (mean clutch size of six eggs did not decline later in the season), second broods were produced in outbreak years (usually only one nesting attempt/normal year), and the number of fl edglings per successful nest increased with increasing beetle abundance and nuthatch densities, but declined with increased squirrel densities. Since fecundity did not diff er between new and reused cavities, the costs and benefi ts of excavation versus cavity reuse may be neutralized for nuthatches during strong resource pulses. Overall, the beetle outbreak reduced food constraints for nuthatches and provided alternate food for nest predators, allowing increased annual fecundity.},

Excavating species may create new cavities to exploit food resource pulses in novel habitats, but availability of nesting resources may be constrained with increases in population densities. Over a 15-y period, we monitored the reproduction of cavity nesters and a large-scale mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreak that killed all mature lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia), at 30 mixed coniferous—deciduous stands in interior British Columbia, Canada. We examined how the probability of excavation of a bark insectivorous, facultative cavity excavator, the red-breasted nuthatch (Sitta canadensis), was influenced by mountain pine beetle abundance and changes in population densities of conspecific individuals and a nest predator, red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsomcus). Nuthatches always chose trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) for nesting regardless of densities of nuthatch nests and availability of beetle-decayed pine as alternate nest trees. The number of nuthatch nests increased in years of increasing densities of beetle-infected pine, and the proportion of freshly excavated nests varied annually, increasing with the beetle outbreak from 26\% of all cavities used in 2001 to 70\% in 2002 and then declining after the outbreak to 17\% in 2009. For each unit increase in densities per hectare of both nuthatches and beetle-infected pine trees, the odds that individuals would excavate a new cavity rather than use an existing cavity increased by 147 times. With each 10 m farther into the coniferous forest interior, the odds of excavation increased by 10 times. These results suggest that facultative excavators are able to exploit novel habitats during insect outbreaks by adjusting their nest-site selection patterns and increasing excavation, but that resource pulses may lead to limitation of nesting resources.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Optimizing breeding phenology, an important aspect of fitness, is complex for migratory species as they must make key timing decisions early, and remotely, from breeding sites. We examined the role of weather (locally and cross-seasonally), cavity availability, and competitive exclusion in determining among-year variation in breeding phenology over 17 yr for 2 migratory, cavity-nesting birds: Mountain Bluebirds (Sialia currucoides; n = 462 nests) and Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor; n = 572) using natural tree cavities in British Columbia, Canada. We assessed weather effects within the winter and migratory range and at our study sites. We quantified competition as the proportion of cavities occupied by European Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) (for both species) and Mountain Bluebirds (for Tree Swallow only) in each year. For 229 bluebird and 177 swallow nests with known fates, we tested whether late years resulted in reduced productivity. Although the effects were small, heavy rainfall and strong diurnal westerly winds during migration were associated with breeding delays for Mountain Bluebirds. However, cavity availability (earlier breeding with increases) had a 5–8 × greater effect on timing than migratory conditions. There was no evidence that starling competition delayed bluebirds. In Tree Swallows, greater local daily rainfall was associated with delayed breeding, as was starling abundance (the effect of starlings was 1.4 × smaller than that of rainfall). Neither bluebird abundance nor cavity availability changed swallow phenology. Neither species showed reduced productivity in late breeding years. In both species, individuals that bred late relative to conspecifics within-year had smaller clutches and greater probability of nest failure. We conclude that breeding ground conditions, particularly cavity limitation and local rainfall (for swallows), are important drivers of breeding phenology for our focal species, but that the productivity cost of late years, at least for Tree Swallows, is minimal.},

	abstract = {The pH of grape juice or wine is a the major quality factor. Research has demonstrated that rootstocks can affect grape juice pH by changing grape juice K+ concentration. Field and glasshouse studies indicated that this effect of rootstocks on scion grape juice pH and K+ levels originate from different K+ uptake rates of rootstock varieties. At least with the varieties tested, these genotypic differences in K+ uptake only occurred at high levels of K+ supply, and not at low levels of K+ supply. This indicates that as in the roots of most other plant species. a dual K+ uptake mechanism exists in roots of grapevines, and that only the mechanism operational at high K+ levels is different in the rootstock varieties studied. It therefore appears feasible to breed rootstock varieties, which combine high K+ efficiency at low K+ supply with restricted K+ uptake at high supply. This model is currently being verified under German conditions on a range of rootstock varieties.},

Pre-dawn leaf water potential was measured weekly during the growing period. The water consumption of grapevines was measured by a modified Granier system. This method allows a continuous measurement of sap flow through the stem under natural conditions in the field. Measurements were carried out over a 4 month period in 1998. Data obtained from sap flow sensors showed differences in transpiration rates caused by different canopy sizes and varying evaporative demands as a result of changing meteorological conditions. During a period of 130 days the average water use of minimally pruned vines reached 372 litres per plant, while water consumption of VSP-vines was 282 litres per vine.},

During the two seasons the data was taken (1992 and 1993), soil water content of the trial plot was similar and decreased during the growing season. Pre-dawn leaf water potential (Psi(leaf)), pre-dawn leaf osmotic potential (Psi(pi)), and stem water potential values (Psi(stem)) did not differ among the treatments. Net carbon dioxide assimilation (A), stomatal conductance (g(s)), and instantaneous water use efficiency (WUE) were influenced by treatment, and behaved similarly comparing the two years. Carignane vines had significantly greater gas exchange values than either V. riparia or the grafted vines, but the latter two were similar to one another. These results indicate that under non-irrigated conditions, rootstock can modify gas exchange behavior of the scion cultivar even though vine water status was not altered.},

The effects of Phylloxera infection on water relationships of grapevine (Vitis vinifera) were investigated in a pot experiment at the Institut for Grapevine Breeding and Grafting, Geisenheim (Germany). The rootstock used was 5 C (Vitis berlandieri x Vitis riparia), the scions were White Riesling and Pinot gris (Rulander). During the growing season 1998, the effect of root damage, caused by Phylloxera, on leaf area development and water consumption was studied on adequately watered plants, growing in 30 L pots. Water consumption of infested and non-infested vines was studied by sap flow measurement according to Granier. The Granier method allows a continuous measurement of the transpiration of the whole plant in the field. Transpiration was measured over a period of 66 days, starring on July 19, 1998 on three vines in each treatment. The mean cumulative sap flow of these three plants over the entire measurement period was expressed as sap now per unit leaf area. The transpiration rate, expressed in litres per m(2) leaf area, did not show any differences between infested and non infested vines. It can be concluded, that the presence of even high numbers of nodosities had no influence at the transpiration of the vine, if water supply was adequate.},

Protoplast fusion is an alternative that can be used to circumvent these difficulties and efficiently transfer resistances to biotic and abiotic stress to commercial scion cultivars and rootstocks. More than 20 interspecific, intergeneric, and intertribal somatic hybrids have recently been obtained in our program by electrically induced fusion. The hybrids include those from elite scion cultivars such as Bonanza navel orange + Red blush grapefruit, Newhall navel orange + Eureka lemon. Newhall navel + Kuigan, Kinnow + Bendizao tangerine, and those from complementary rootstocks such as red tangerine + trifoliate orange, red tangerine + rough lemon, red tangerine + citrange. Fusion between Citrus and its wild relatives such as Page tangelo + Murraya paniculata and C. sinensis + Clausena lansium (6x) regenerated allo-tetraploid and allo-hexaploid plants respectively. By standard symmetric fusion, diploid mesophyll parent type plants (putative cybrids) from more than ten combinations were also regenerated. To verify their hybridity, all the regenerants were identified by morphology, cytology, isozyme analysis and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. Further identification by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and horticultural evaluation is in progress.},

Roots and leaves were analysed for water extractable fraction of anions (NO3-, Cl-, HPO42-, SO42-, HPLC method) and cations (K+, Ca2+, Mg2+ Na+; AAS method). Varietal differences in anion content of the roots were significant: 5-10 times higher anion levels were measured in Georgikon 28 and Rupestris du Lot than in Kahet and Fercal and this difference was smaller in the leaf blades. Cl- was the most mobile anion in the plants reflected by the high Cl- level of the roots and leaves in Cl- treatments. Two different defending mechanisms can be distinguished on the basis of Cl- content of the roots: Cl- accumulation (Georgikon 28 and Rupestris du Lot, 2331 and 1845 mu mol/g dw. Cl- respectively) and Cl- exclusion (Kahet and Fercal, 230 and 518 mu mol/gdw. Cl-).. A mutual interference of Cl- and NO3- ions could be observed. Elevated level (50 mM) of Cl- or NO3- in the nutrient solution inhibited the transport of the other anion to a large extent. In Cl- treatments the NO3- concentration of the roots was decreased to 30-60 \% of the NO3- content of the control plants. In the presence of 50 mM NO3-, Cl- was not found in the roots of Rupestris du Lot and Georgikon 28 and in Kahet and Fercal the low control Cl- level was slightly affected. In 25 mM Ca(Cl)(2) treatments the intensive Cl- transport was accompanied by the increase of the water soluble K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentration in the leaves.},

In the present study we give account of leaves originated from vines grown same soil type and nutrient condition. Statistically significant differences were found in the yield production and Ca concentration of scion leaf blades according to the rootstocks as well according to the scions also. After the first yield production year the differences in K and Ca contents of the leaves were greater by the scion varieties than the rootstocks. The highest Ca concentrations were determined at the scion leaves with combination of Georgikon 28 \{(V. berlandieri x V. riparia T. K. 5BB) x V. vinifera\} rootstock. The differences in Ca concentrations were higher according to the scion varieties.

Control plants and slag treated vine plants exhibited a similar pattern of composition in respect to main elements such as N, S, P, Mg, K, indicating an acceptable nutrition status in the presence of a top slag layer, except that leaves of slag plants showed slight symptoms of phosphate deficiency. The high sodium concentration in the alkaline top layer caused a significant increase of the sodium content in the roots developing in this layer and to a lesser extent in the roots of the bottom layer. However, no increase was observed in the sodium content of leaves demonstrating sodium exclusion from vine leaves. The heavy metal burden of the alkaline top layer caused a strong increase of lead, cadmium, copper, zinc, and chromium contents of the roots of this layer. The corresponding values for roots in the bottom layer were much lower and no significant differences between control and slag treated plants were observed. Similar applied to the leaves, the heavy metal contents of which were significantly lower than that of the roots of the bottom layer. Thus also heavy metals are largely excluded from the transport from the rootstock to the scions. The only element exhibiting a large transfer from the polluted alkaline top layer to the vine leaves and roots in the bottom layer was boron. This element accumulated in all organs of the vine plants treated with slag, particular in the leaves, where its concentration went up almost close to limits of phytotoxicity. Data are discussed in respect to potential hazards of municipal waste incinerator bottom slag to the environment if this material is used as construction and support material.},

The incidence of crown gall on a susceptible grape scion cultivar (Vitis vinifera, cv. Kiralyleanyka) was not affected by grafting it on a crown gall resistant rootstock (Vitis riparia, cv. Gloire) or on a susceptible rootstock (V.berlandieri x V.riparia, cv. Teleki 5C) when the inoculated vines were observed over a 2-month period in the greenhouse. Weights of galls that were induced by six of eight strains of Agrobacterium (six A.vitis and two A.tumefaciens) were not significantly different, but A.tumefaciens strain 16/6 and A.vitis strain 2/3 produced significantly larger galls on Kiralyleanyka vines that were growing on their own roots or were grafted on SC than on those grafted on Gloire. When the same vines were planted in the field and observed over a 4-year period, no differences in incidence of crown gall were apparent until the third and fourth years, when vines grafted on Gloire had less crown gall than vines on 5C. By that time, the natural symptoms (galls along the trunk) of the disease appeared, coinciding with the decline of whole vines. In another field experiment, with naturally infected scions of V.vinifera, cv. Blau Frankisch (susceptible), crown gall was apparent on vines grafted on both rootstocks after 2 years, but in the fifth year 79 \% of the vines on SC had crown gall whereas only 9\% on Gloire showed symptoms. After the appearance of typical natural symptoms, vines showed reduced vigor with substantial loss of trunks and entire vines. During this period, many vines on 5C died as compared with only a few on Gloire. By the end of the sixth year, 13 \% of the originally planted vines on 5C and 82\% on Gloire were alive, and although many pathogenic strains of Agrobacterium spp. were isolated from the roots of 5C, none was isolated from Gloire.},

At other times, plots were irrigated with river water (EC 0.5 dS/m) as was the control throughout the season. Saline water (EC 3.5 dS/m) with a high sodium absorption ratio was produced by addition of sodium chloride brine. Soil cation exchange capacity was 14 cmol(c)/kg, and at the end of the trial, the soil exchangeable sodium percentage in the control was 6\%, in the treatment salinised pre-flowering 13\%, during berry development 20\%, during berry ripening 20\%, and post-harvest 19\%. Treatments were applied for 6 consecutive seasons. Vines were highly productive, with the average yield in the control equal to 62 t/ha of grapes. Saline irrigation caused significant, but small, declines in yield in 3 seasons, in pruning weights in 2 seasons, and in berry weights in 4 seasons. Effects on growth, once established, often persisted unchanged through one or more subsequent seasons of saline irrigation. The growth stage shown to be most sensitive to saline irrigation was berry development; saline irrigation during berry development reduced the yield by 7\% and during berry ripening by 3\%, and pre-flowering it reduced the berry weight by 1\%, during berry development by 6\%, and during berry ripening by 4\%. The amounts of irrigation applied in each of the 4 growth stages were not equal, and hence, treatments did not receive equal additions of salt. Normalising data to remove this effect showed that the rate of yield decline per unit dS/m increase in the seasonal average salinity during berry development, 7\%/dS.m, was 3-fold greater than the 2\%/dS.m during berry ripening. We conclude that this scion/rootstock combination, grown under these conditions, can maintain high productivity despite `slugs' of saline irrigation.},

Cuttings of Vitis vinifera cv. Muller Thurgau were grafted onto three hybrid rootstocks (H1, H8, H26) and grown in pots. Own-rooted plants of V. vinifera and own-rooted hybrids were also cultivated in an identical manner. Vines were tested during 7 and 14 days of water stress (i.e. daily water supply reduced to 66\% of well-watered plants). Water stress reduced net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance with large differences between grafted and ungrafted vines. Significant differences were observed after only 14 days of water stress. In particular two grafting combinations, V. vinifera grafted on H1 (V/H1) and H8 (V/H8), did not show net photosynthesis reduction after 14 days of water stress. Water use efficiency increased with water stress whereas carboxylation efficiency was reduced. Net photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and carboxylation efficiency were affected by the rootstock genotype combination, so that under water stress only some rootstock genotypes transferred drought tolerance to the scion. Abscisic acid in leaves increased significantly from Control to 7 and 14 days of water stress but the relations with CO2 assimilation rate, stomatal conductance and carboxylation efficiency appeared to be affected by the genotype of the vegetative apparatus. Our data show that the interaction between scion and rootstock with regard to production performance under water deficits may be an important consideration in vineyard planting strategies.

In a series of nursery-based trials with natural pathogen inoculum, application of either B-4117 or CR330D significantly reduced the incidence and severity of crown gall caused by A. tumefaciens on grapeville and raspberry. The extent of disease control depended upon the variety tested. Both bacteria reduced disease during seedling root production and grafting. The disease incidence on root cuttings of three grapevine varieties was reduced by 56-80\% and the disease severity index (DSI) was decreased by 75-86\%. Depending on the scion variety, the number of healthy rooted grafts increased by 2-3.5-fold, while the DSI was reduced by 1.5-3-fold. The results suggest that there is potential in using these antagonists to diminish the influence of latent rootstock infection on graft sensitivity to crown gall. Pretreatment of rooted raspberry seedlings with P. aureofaciens B-4117 prevented the development of crown galls caused by A. tumefaciens strain K24 or by a mixture of A. tumefaciens pathogenic strains previously isolated from raspberry. Both Pseudomonas spp. persisted on the root surfaces of inoculated vine cuttings and in non-sterile soil.

	abstract = {Traditionally, grapevine varieties are identified by morphological characteristics, e.g. leaf shape and size, type and density of hairs on shoot tips and leaves. This method depends both on green shoots and in many cases on specific stages of plant development. Furthermore also environmental factors affect morphological characteristics of plants. To become independent of environmental influence and plant development, molecular biological techniques e.g. RFLP and RAPD/PCR were soon adapted to grapevines. Most previous studies on grapevine identification dealt with scion varieties, whereas publications on rootstocks are quite rare. Rootstocks, treated as disbudded material, do not have enough morphological characteristics for variety identification. Therefore the aim of this study was to develop a procedure to identify rootstock varieties from dormant cuttings. During these investigations a method for DNA-extraction from one-year old grapevine cuttings was developed by adapting LODHI's DNA-extraction procedure. This modified method allows a fast reliable and inexpensive DNA-extraction. It yields good DNA quality and purity. DNA, extracted by this procedure, was amplified by RAPD/PCR reaction and fractionated on an agarose-gel. Overall 48 RAPD (random amplified polymorphic DNA) -primers were tested to find polymorphisms useful for the identification of the seven most common rootstock varieties in Germany (Teleki 8B, Kober 125AA, Kober 5BB, 5C Geisenheim, SO4, 3309C and Boerner). It proved to be possible to distinguish all seven rootstocks using two primers only. Therefore the method is suitable for routine variety determination of dormant cuttings.},

It requires micropropagated and acclimatised indicator plants for green-grafting with leaf petiole or secondary shoot from plants in field as scion. At the end of June, the material was manually green-grafted on the predisposed indicator plants, which were pruned to two buds for the development of possible symptoms. The graft unions were protected with a strip of parafilm. The plants were kept in a greenhouse under mist for 15 days. The controls were carried out after 40 days: the first symptoms were visible on the upper and lower surfaces of median and basal leaves of the indicator plant. Best results were seemingly obtained by using secondary shoots of infected vines for the rootstocks and leaf petioles for cv of V. vinifera L. This technique could be a simpler and faster alternative bioassay. It has the advantage to use test material (leaves or secondary shoots) available during the whole growing season and always of the right size with respect to the indicator plant.},

So far it has demonstrated a high resistance against all strains of phylloxera, available for testing. It has a grafting affinity similar to commonly used Berlandieri x Riparia rootstocks and shows a good adaptation to a wide range of soil types. The performance of Riesling as scion grafted on `Borner' is similar or better than that of commonly used rootstocks in Germany and in particular under dry conditions.

The disease affects berry set and can result in yield reductions of 80\% or greater. There are few control measures. Nematicides and fumigants have not proven effective and further development of these pesticides is limited by concerns of ground water contamination and environmental toxicity. Development of rootstocks capable of resisting X. index feeding has been underway at the University of California, Davis since the 1970s, and a Vitis vinifera x Muscadinia rotundifolia hybrid, 039-16, was released: This' rootstock is limited by its potential phylloxera susceptibility, susceptibility to root-knot nematodes, and induction of high vigor to the scion. Vitis rupestris x M. rotundifolia hybrids were bred with strong resistance to X index. A revised screening technique found a very high correlation between feeding damage and nematode numbers. Sixty of the 200 seedlings tested were resistant, and a RAPD marker produced by the Operon primer OPA-12 was found to be tightly linked to resistance. Two of these seedlings 8913-02 and 8913-21 are highly resistant to X: index, several very aggressive strains of root-knot nematode, and phylloxera. Field trials with these and other V. rupestris x M. rotundifolia hybrids are in place and are designed to test the durability of their resistance and evaluate their viticultural characteristics.},

A PA designated rootstock-scion incompatibility (RSI)-24 kDa, grapevine corky bark PA, and GLRaV-2b MAb reacted to polypeptides of approximately 24 kDa isolated from grapevines exhibiting rootstock-scion incompatibility, leafroll, and corky bark disease symptoms, suggesting that these isolates are infected with closely related viruses.

The reactivity of GLRaV-2 US to various polypeptides suggests that the immunogen used to produce this antiserum was a mixture of viruses. Apical meristems were excised and cultured to eliminate the infection of viruses in the grapevines showing RSI symptoms and in the cultivar French Colombard infected with GLRaV-1. The elimination of these viruses was confirmed by Western blot assay.

	abstract = {Despite the great economic importance of citrus, its phylogeny and taxonomy remain a matter of controversy. Moreover pathogens of increased virulence and dramatic environmental changes are currently spreading or emerging. The objectives of the present paper, measuring genetic variability and studying its pattern of distribution, are crucial steps to optimize sampling strategies in the search of genotypes that tolerate or resist these threatening factors within the huge array of Citrus and Citrus related species. Their intraspecific and intrageneric variability was studied comparatively by means of ten enzymatic systems using eight different measures. The analysis of ten enzymatic systems allowed us to distinguish all the species and all but one artificial hybrid. The species with the lowest genotypic variability are C. myrtifolia, C. deliciosa (willow leaf mandarin), C. paradisi (grapefruit), C. limon (lemon) and C. sinensis (sweet orange), while Severinia buxifolia shows the highest value. A broad spectrum of heterozygosity values was found in the collection. Lemons (C. limon, C. meyeri, C. karna, C. volkameriana), limes (C. aurantifolia, C. limettioides, C. lattifolia) and C. bergamia show a very high percentage of heterozygosity which indicates an origin through interspecific hybridization. Two main factors limit genetic intraspecific variability: apomictic reproduction: where nucellar embryos are much more vigorous than the zygotic ones, and nursery-men selecting against variability in the seedling stage of the rootstocks or in propagating the scion cultivars vegetatively. Additionally, self-pollination appears in some species mainly used as rootstocks which would explain their low heterozygosity values. Genetic differences between species and genera are in general high, which suggests that adaptation might have played an important role during the evolution of the orange subfamily.},

Previous results revealed that vintage data were not sufficient for evaluations of rootstock effects. Investigations in rootstock-scion interactions during ripening progress showed significant effects on berry compounds due to the genetic origin of the rootstocks: amount and progress of sugar accumulation, decrease of titratable acidity, ratio of malic and tartaric acids, potassium concentration and finally the acceptance of nines. In comparison with the V.berlandieri x V.riparia rootstocks (5C, 5BB, SO4) the V.rupestris-based Ruggeri 140 caused a quick start of sugar accumulation, but during endripening a slow further accumulation. So the V.berl. x V.rip. rootstocks gave rise to better must density at last. Additionally potassium decreased in a significant way after a maximum during veraison. Sensory and analytical evaluations of wines revealed a significant positive correlation between acceptance of wines and their K+ concentration. So the following recommendations for optimizing wine grape quality of the cultivar Gruener Veltliner resulted from the investigations: Gruener Veltliner grafted onto Ru 140 is early ripening with sufficient compounds of juice, and so well suited for late sites. In good ! years however, vintage must not be delayed to prevent poor vines caused by deficiency of potassium. If Gruener Veltliner is grafted onto V.ber. x V.rip. rootstocks vintage can be delayed until the decrease of titratable acidity will draw the line. For optimizing wine quality, the rootstocks have to be chosen in accordance to the sites, and the moment of vintage must be chosen in accordance to the year's climate and the specific effects of rootstocks.},

	abstract = {In spite of their efficiency, sanitary and genetic selection methods require a long period of time, particularly for local grapevine varieties. When perfectly performed, micrografting might be a rapid selection method; however, apices taken from field plants did not improve the percentage of successful grafts more than 10-15\%. Such failures were directly related to the higher incidence of browning and drying apices. On the other hand, use of sand media or in vitro techniques did not improve results with micrografting. To overcome these constraints, pretreatments of the scion apex as well as the rootstock were considered necessary. Given the necessity for pretreatment, our results (Ben Abdallah et al., 1996) have shown a significant improvement in grafting success (57\%). An alternative method is to use higher concentrations of MgSO4 (450 mg/L), and Fe-EDTA (40 mg/L) supplemented with benzylaminopyrine (BAP; 2mg/L) and naphtaleneacetic acid (NAA; 0.1 mg/L). Accordingly, we obtained a high graft take (63\%) by using rockwool-grown seedlings as rootstocks. The placement of the apex on the outward cortical surface of the hypocotyl plays a significant role in increasing success and reducing by 35 to 36\% the incidence of browning and drying of apices. The technique was applied to three local varieties adapted to dry and salt conditions that are of economic and agronomic importance.},

	abstract = {A portable infra-red gas analyzer system was used to measure net photosynthetic rates on individual leaves of field-grown Vitis vinifera L. plants. Generally, the leaf opposite to the upper cluster or all leaves of an average shoot were measured between 10:00 and 12:00. In Pinot noir (clone M 1/17) planted in 1985, there was a significant effect of training system early in the season: photosynthesis of high-trained cordon pruned vines nas 27\% lower than of low-trained either cane or cordon pruned vines. However this effect disappeared later in the season. Leaf position within the canopy and, therewith. light availability on individual leaves became the predominant factor affecting photosynthetic rates, although the highest assimilation rates were measured in the middle part of the shoot and decreasing rates towards both the basal (source) and apical (sink) leaves. When 3 leaves were removed in the cluster zone of Pinot noir vines 3 weeks after bloom. photosynthesis of the remaining leaves increased as compared to the removal of 6 or 12 leaves. Six weeks after leaf removal net assimilation rates started to decrease. This decrease was, however, the stronger the less leaves had been removed, indicating a delay in senescence of the remaining leaves after defoliation. If the lateral shoots were consistently removed during the season. the main-shoot leaves responded by increasing their photosynthetic rates during the rest of the season and by a delay in senescence. In Muller-Thurgau grapevines on 5C planted in 1988, with either 2 (control). 1 or 0 grape clusters after either carl! or late cluster thinning, no significant effect of crop load could be detected on leaf gas exchange. Nevertheless. there was a clear trend towards higher photosynthetic rates in the control vines during the entire season. Leaves in the upper part of the shoot (number 10 from the base) always assimilated at a higher rate than leaves in the cluster zone (number 4 from the base). The difference increased from 5\% at bloom time to 65\% at han cst. Rootstocks markedly affected net assimilation rates of scion leaves in Muller-Thurgau planted in 1986. and there was a significant interaction with nitrogen fertilization. Generally, 100 kg N/ha increased leaf gas exchange compared to non-fertilization. However. this increase was minor in vines on 3309 and Ru 140, intermediate in vines on 5BB. 5C and 8B, and large in vines on SO4. In unfertilized vines the highest photosynthetic rates were found on 5BB, which were similar to the average of all rootstocks in the fertilized vines. On the other hand, the lowest rates in the unfertilized plants were measured on SO4, whereas this rootstock led to the highest rates in the fertilized vines. These results indicate that training systems should be designed to maximize the leaf area directly exposed to incident sunlight rather than maximizing the total leaf area. They also emphasize the importance of young, actively assimilating leaves late in the season for quality wine grape production. as well as the effect of sink demand on source productivity. In addition-interacting effects have been shown of rootstock and nitrogen availability indicating that rootstocks should be chosen according to soil fertility, in order to avoid unnecessary fertilization.},

For the first time transformation of a scion variety is reported. A chimeric coat protein gene (CP) was integrated in order to protect grapevine against grapevine fanleaf virus (GFLV) infection, A neomycin phosphotransferase II (NPT II) gene allowed the selection of large number of transformed embryogenic calli and plants for the three varieties, Percentages of transformed material were first estimated with GUS activity, Presence of the CP gene was assessed by PCR and Southern analysis and gene expression by ELISA. Transformed calli have now been subcultured in vitro for 3 years without losing their embryogenic ability, GUS activity assays on leaves and roots of acclimatized plants showed transformation to be stable.},

As the mechanical inoculation of a virus to the grapevine succeeds only under special conditions, we compared different grafting techniques: dormant grafting and green grafting, the last with and without previously rooted rootstock. For each of these three methods, the inoculum was used as the stock on one hand, as the scion on the other hand. This study proved that the dormant grafting technique using the inoculum as the rootstock is the most efficient technique. Nevertheless, good results were obtained by using the green grafting technique without previously rooting the rootstock, the inoculum being also used as the rootstock. As the green grafting method doesn't require a great area, is not time-consuming and can be performed throughout the year, it seems therefore to be a very convenient method of inoculating a great number of varieties.},

Tobacco suspension cell protoplasts were electroporated with plasmid constructions, bearing or not bearing RNA-derived sequences, and, subsequently, were electroporated with CLRV virions or virion RNA. Replication of CLRV in protoplasts was demonstrated by accumulation of both positive- and negative-sense CLRV genomic RNAs 1 and 2, capsid antigen, and virions. Three plasmids were tested for antiviral action. These have inserts that were derived from the coat protein gene, inserted in both orientations, and from the 3' terminal sequence that is nearly identical in RNA 1 and RNA 2, oriented for expression of antisense RNA. Plasmids were introduced into protoplasts 12 hr prior to introducing the virions or virion RNA. CLRV accumulation was reduced significantly by prior electroporation of plasmids intended to express coat protein or 3' antisense RNA, but not by electroporation of plasmid without insert or plasmid with coat protein encoding sequences in the antisense orientation. These results demonstrate the utility of transient expression in a protoplast system for comparing the efficacy of a variety of virus-derived and other sequences for their potential application in Virus control strategies.

Our results indicate that grapevine viroids are mainly propagated through systemic transmission upon grafting.

	abstract = {Clonal selection commenced at Geisenheim in 1921. Due to the long tradition of grape growing and the presence of Xiphinema index, fanleaf, and other virus diseases low productivity was common. Focusing selection on the genetic improvement of traditional German varieties resulted in a major reduction in the occurrence of grapevine fanleaf and leafroll disease. The effectiveness of these selection methods in eradicating the economically important virus infections was demonstrated in the late 1960s, when indexing became available as a breeder's tool for virus detection. From the mid-1980s, ELISA techniques were increasingly adapted for monitoring the disease status of Geisenheim clones and varieties. Today, virus tests are conducted at every propagation step, effectively preventing the multiplication of fanleaf- and leafroll-infected bud Mood. To prevent gene erosion, Geisenheim breeders tried to maintain the genetic range within varieties by selecting a large number of different clones of each variety and commenced clonal selection on minor varieties to prevent their extinction. Today, Geisenheim has 73 clones of 10 scion varieties and 32 clones of nine rootstock varieties registered. Two hundred hectares of scion and about 200 hectares of rootsrock mother blocks are under permanent supervision. The effectiveness and value of clonal selection even today is demonstrated by the variety Blauer Fruhburgunder (Pinot noir precoce). The wine of this variety has long been mythical among German winemakers and is considered as superior to that of Pinot noir, but wide-spread virus infections and a low genetic yield potential of less than 2.5 t/ha virtually wiped out this variety. Clonal selection could eradicate the virus-infected material and produce clones with an average yield of 8 to 9 t/ha, without reducing the wine quality.},

The rootstocks, Salt Creek (Ramsey), Harmony, Freedom, 039-16, Kober 5BB, Teleki 5C, 1103 Paulsen, 3309C, 101-14 Mgt, and own root were used in each location. Plots were established in 1990 and data collection began in 1993. Harmony and 3309C produced the smallest berries in three out of four plots, while own-root and 039-16 produced the smallest berries in one plot. The largest berries were produced by Salt Creek in all four plots. Packable yields followed similar trends. Own root, Harmony, 3309C, 039-16, and Harmony (tied with 3309C) exhibited the lowest packable yields in at least one location. The rootstocks 039-16, Teleki 5C, Salt Creek (tied with 1103 Paulsen), and 1103 Paulsen exhibited the highest packable yields in at least one location. For Thompson Seedless there was a tendency for 3309C to have lower yields and 1103 Paulsen higher yields; 039-16 produced the smallest berries in one location, the largest berries in another other. Each location is capable of producing meaningful data; however, when several locations are compared, variation in rootstock performance increases. The results to date support the premise that there will not be a single rootstock recommendation for all cultivars.

The bacterium was present at varying levels in both rootstock and scion material from New South Wales, Victoria, and Western Australia. A genomic DNA fingerprinting technique was used to compare these strains of A. vitis with strains previously isolated from South Australian propagation material and with strains from the United States of America, particularly strains from the University of California at Davis where a number of Australian grape cultivars originated. Nine distinct DNA fingerprint types were found, demonstrating that A. vitis is a genetically heterogeneous species. There were no DNA fingerprint types in common between Australian states, suggesting that little or no transfer of A, vitis between states has occurred. Two Californian strains were indistinguishable, when analysed by DNA fingerprinting, from strains isolated over a 14 year period in South Australia. This finding is strong circumstantial evidence that A. vitis was introduced to South Australia on grapevine cuttings imported from California. Given the fact that A. vitis is probably not indigenous to Australia, it is possible that the different strains found in each state were the result of independent introductions. Although grapevines from all Australian states tested did contain A. vitis, the existence of unique strains in each state means that the restrictions on movement of grapevine material between states should be maintained, and that quarantine authorities should avoid introducing further strains of the bacterium.},

	abstract = {Citrus and grapevines are salt-sensitive perennial crops. Damage caused by salinity is due mostly to accumulation of excessive concentrations of salt (Na- and Cl ions) in shoot tissues. In both crops, however, some rootstock varieties can restrict the accumulation of salt in scion leaves and stems. Salt-excluding rootstocks, however, are often deficient with regard to other desirable characteristics and as such their use is limited. As a consequence, we have conducted a range of crosses within both crops to select new salt-excluding hybrids which may have potential as new rootstocks and also to investigate the inheritance of salt exclusion in these woody perennials. In citrus, both Cl-ion and Na-ion exclusion has been observed as a continuous character and progenies segregate widely for their ability to restrict the accumulation of these ions in shoot tissues. The ability to exclude Cl ions appears to be independent of the ability to exclude Na ions. Thus a good Cl-ion excluder is not necessarily a good Na-ion excluder and vice versa. It has been possible, however, to select new salt-excluding citrus hybrids which perform as well as and sometimes better than parent varieties when grafted with a common scion and grown in artificially salinised field plots. In grapevines, the research has concentrated on the ability for Cl-ion exclusion and depending on the Cl-ion-excluding parent chosen this is inherited as either a polygenic or monogenic trait. In crosses between Vitis champini (Cl-ion excluder) and Vitis vinifera (Cl-ion accumulator), the ability to restrict Cl-ion accumulation in shoot tissues segregates widely with some offspring transgressing the performance of either parent. In crosses and backcrosses involving V. berlandieri and V. vinifera, however, hybrids segregate as either Cl-ion excluders or accumulators suggesting the effect of a major dominant gene for Cl-ion exclusion from V. berlandieri. This was evident from both field and glasshouse experiments although possible modifying genes from V. vinifera may affect the expression of this gene under glasshouse conditions in some crosses.},

Dormant scion and rootstock cuttings treated identically in the U.S. gave similar results. Despite this, it was possible to confirm the efficacy of thermotherapy in eradicating the pathogen. An assessment was also made of the effect of treatment on growth parameters of grafted vines in the greenhouse and after 8 months in a field nursery. The effect of hot-water treatment on the vitality and growth of vines varied with the different scion-rootstock combinations. Treatment did not generally have detrimental effects on vitality; there were some negative effects on graft-take. The number and length of canes, as well as the diameter of the trunks, increased in most instances. The treatments and times usually did not affect bud survival and, in most cases, increased the level of callus formation at the base of cuttings.},

	abstract = {Primary (direct) and secondary (indirect) influences of rootstocks on vine cold hardiness were determined independently. Vine size (kg of cane prunings per vine) reflects the number of shoots produced per m of row and is closely associated with shoot crowding and internal canopy shading. This shading is a secondary rootstock influence. Own-rooted Seyval (Sey/own), Seyval grafted to Seyval (Sey/Sey), Kober 5 BB (Sey/5 BB), and Couderc 3309 (Sey/3309) were the rootstock treatments used. Vine size classes were large (1.82-2.27 kg), medium (1.14-1.59 kg) and small (0.45-0.91 kg) and were established within each rootstock group. Rootstock choice had no effect on vine growth and canopy development. Vine productivity was influenced slightly, primarily through differences in cluster weight. By contrast, vine size, regardless of rootstock chosen, had a great impact on both vine growth and yield. Direct rootstock effects on cold hardiness were assessed via measurement of cumulative injury to buds and expressed as shootless nodes. Cane cold hardiness was based on the within-vine distribution of canes with differing characteristics associated with hardiness (diameter, exposure to sunlight during growth and the development of 5 or more mature nodes). Both primary and secondary influences of rootstocks on cold hardiness were observed. Bud hardiness was best on scions grafted to Couderc 3309, and there was a significant graft union effect; Sey/own vines had more bud mortality than Sey/Sey vines. Vine size did not influence the percentage of shootless nodes when canes of comparable quality were evaluated. The within-vine distribution of cane quality was influenced, however, and large vines had a greater number of both poorly matured and canes with superior hardiness status. By contrast, rootstock did not influence the within-vine distribution of cane quality. Large vines are not inferior to small vines in the number of best quality canes produced and should be equally hardy if careful cane selection is practiced at pruning. Assessment of the within-vine distribution of canes with superior cold hardiness appears to be a useful method of determining secondary treatment effects on vine cold hardiness. This aspect of vine cold hardiness should receive greater attention by viti-culture researchers.},

Vines were grown in plastic containers in an unheated plastic house. Budbreak began earlier and shoot growth was more vigorous on vines grafted on 3306, SO.4, and 101-14 compared with those on 420A, 8B, and 5C stocks. The number of lateral shoots and their lengths were smallest on scions grafted on 420A stock. More flower clusters per shoot were formed on vines grafted on 420A, 8B, and 3306 than were formed on 101-14. Although the number of florets per cluster was not significant among shoots on different rootstocks, the rate of elongation of panicles in vines grafted on both 101-14 and 5C tended to be faster than it was on SO.4 and 420A. No difference was observed in the percentage set of berries among the vines grafted on six stocks except for 420A, in which the set was significantly higher. Small differences in both flowering time and `veraison' were observed among the vines grafted on seven stocks. The ratio of seeded berries to total berries was higher in vines grafted on SO.4 and 420A stocks than it was vines on 8B and 3306 stocks. The largest berries were observed in vines grafted on 3306, followed by those on 101-14 and 3309, whereas berries on vines grafted on 5C, SO.4, and 420A were smallest. The total soluble solids of the juice were highest in berries harvested from vines on 3309, SO.4, and 3306 stocks. The titratable acidity was relatively low in vines grafted on all stocks, especially that on SO.4. Vines grafted on 3306 stock yielded berries with the highest level of anthocyanin in the skin; the berries from other `Fujiminori' vines were about equally pigmented.},

	title = {In vitro selection for tolerance to magnesium deficiency in grapevine rootstocks},
	issn = {0042-7500},
	abstract = {Some grapevine rootstocks (4453 Malegue, Fercal) are known as very susceptible to magnesium deficiency, whether it is induced by low level of magnesium in the soil, particularly in acidic soils or, more generally, by high levels of potassium fertilization in soils normally provided with magnesium. So, their cultivation is strongly hindered in many vineyards, despite their other interesting cultural characteristics: very high chlorosis resistance for Fercal, drought tolerance, low vigor and beneficial effects on wine quality for 44-53 Malegue. In vitro tissue culture offers new prospects to solve this problem. In order to select somaclonal variants of these rootstocks exhibiting a lower level of susceptibility to magnesium deficiency, we compared the results of in vitro tests made on different varieties known as tolerant or susceptible to magnesium deficiency with the behavior of these varieties in the vineyard. The varieties chosen were 4453 Malegue and Fercal (susceptible), 418 and 140 Ruggeri (tolerant). Plants were grown for 2 months on culture media with different concentrations of magnesium and potassium. Tissues of samples constituted of the foliar system (leaf blades, petioles and stems) of 6-15 plants (100-300 mg of dry matter) were extracted by HCl 0.1 N (10 ml for 100 mg of dry matter) and ions K(-), Mg(-) and Ca(-) were assayed by flame spectrophotometry. An initial experiment was performed using one-node microcuttings and micrograftings (scion: Vitis vinifera cv. Syrah) grown on a half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium with three levels of potassium and magnesium fertilization. It shows that the uptake of magnesium by vitroplants grown on this medium is not suitable to characterize the differences in susceptibility of rootstock varieties to magnesium deficiency. Fercal was more susceptible than 41 B (difference slightly significant, P = 0.05), 44-53 Malegue appeared curiously more tolerant than 140 Ruggeri, but the difference was not significant. The effect of grafting was not significant and there wag no interaction between variety and grafting. A second experiment was performed using one-node microcuttings grown on a Galzy medium (modified Knoop 1/2), with a low content in magnesium and increasing levels of potassium fertilization (0, 500, 750 and 1000 mg/l of KNO(3)). It showed that the uptake of magnesium was significantly (P) higher in 140 Ruggeri and 41 B than in Fercal and 44-53 Malegue. The inhibitory effect of increasing levels of K(-) on the absorption of Mg(-) was clearly demonstrated. Somatic embryos of 4453 Malegue were obtained by anther culture and selected in conditions of magnesium deficiency After four sub-cultures in liquid medium, 37 embryos were retained from which 4 germinated and developed into plants. Attempts to obtain somatic embryos by anther culture were unsuccessful with the variety Fercal. 3 selected somaplants of 4453 Malegue (S(1), S(2) and S(4)) were compared to an unselected somaplant (T(0)) and the original clone (Cl. 120). After micropropagation of the somaclones, one-node microcuttings and micrograftings (scion: Vitis vinifera cv. Cot) were grown on Galzy medium with reduced level of magnesium and two levels of potassium fertilization (0 and 1000 mg/l KNO(3)). There were no significant differences in the uptake of potassium and calcium between clone and somaclones. With low potassium fertilization, the uptake of magnesium by somaclone S(2) was significantly lower (P {\textless} 0.01). With high potassium fertilization, somaclone S, and clone 120 were significantly lower than the other somaclones S S T. So, there is evidence or somaclonal variation, but it is possible that the occurrence of this variation is not linked to the selection pressure applied in vitro. The amplitude of this variation is small and its stability and expression need to be confirmed in the vineyard. So far, the somaplants have been acclimated in the greenhouse and will be planted next year in the field for further investigations.},

Artificial selection associated with domestication is the best-known example of a major anthropogenic morphological evolution preserved in the archaeological record. However, the impact of the domestication process and dispersal on the morphological evolution of animals has been far less explored. To fill this gap, we focused on 4500 years of evolution in Western Europe Sus scrofa, covering the Neolithic transition ‒ a major anthropogenic ecological disturbance involving landscape modification and the translocation of domestic mammals. Using geometric morphometrics on key phenotypic markers preserved in the archaeological record, associated with isotopic studies, we explored how, and in response to which cultural drivers, the Neolithic niche construction has influenced the morphological evolution of Western European wild boars (Sus scrofa scrofa). The decoupling of size and shape components from bone morphological variation has facilitated the identification of several processes of phenotypic diversification of Sus s. scrofa in response to human behaviour during the Neolithic transition in Western Europe.},

	abstract = {ArtiÞcial defoliation has been used commonly to simulate defoliation by insect her-bivores in experiments, in spite of the fact that obvious differences exist between clipping foliage and natural defoliation due to insect feeding. We used a greenhouse experiment to compare the effects of artiÞcial and western spruce budworm (Choristoneura occidentalis Freeman) defoliation on the growth and biomass allocation of 3-yr old half-sib seedlings from mature Douglas-Þr [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco variety glauca] trees that showed phenotypic resistance versus susceptibility to budworm defoliation in the forest. ArtiÞcial clipping of buds mimicked the effects of budworm feeding on total seedling biomass when 50\% of the terminal buds were damaged. However, artiÞcial defoliation decreased seedling height, relative growth rate of height, and shoot: root ratio more than budworm defoliation, whereas budworm defoliation decreased stem diameter relative growth rate more than artiÞcial defoliation. Half-sib seedling progeny from resistant maternal tree phenotypes had greater height, diameter, biomass, and shoot: root ratio than seedlings from susceptible phenotypes. We concluded that careful artiÞcial defoliation could generally simulate effects of budworm defoli-ation on total biomass of Douglas-Þr seedlings, but that the two defoliation types did not have equal effects on biomass allocation between shoot and root. Further, an inherently higher growth rate and a greater allocation of biomass to shoot versus root are associated with resistance of Douglas-Þr trees to western spruce budworm defoliation.},

	abstract = {This study was conducted in order to determine the appropriate treatment for breaking dormancy and the effect of salinity on seed germination of purple coneflower ( Echinacea purpurea cv. Magnus), in two separate experiments. In the first experiment, five levels of gibberellic acid (GA 3 ) (0, 250, 500, 1000, and 1500 mg×L −1 ) with four levels of cold moist stratification period of seeds at 5°C (0, 5, 10 and 15 days) were launched. A factorial experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design with four replications. The statistical analysis showed that concentration of 250 mg×L −1 GA 3 with 10 days of cold moist chilling significantly increased the percentage of germination of normal seedlings and reduced the mean time of germination. In the second experiment, the seeds were chilled for 10 days at 5°C and half of them treated with 250 mg×L −1 GA 3 for 24 hours. The seeds treated with GA 3 , and those non-treated were subjected to NaCl for salinity stress. The experiment was conducted using five salinity levels (0, 20, 40, 60 and 80 mM NaCl) in four replications in a completely randomized design. The results showed that purple coneflower is highly sensitive to salinity in the germination stage. The results also showed that by increasing salinity levels, the percentage of germination and normal seedlings significantly decreased and the mean time to germination increased, compared to the control treatment. But the seeds treated with GA 3 showed higher viability and better performance under salinity stress condition.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} The expression of defensive morphologies in prey often is correlated with predator abundance or diversity over a range of temporal and spatial scales. These patterns are assumed to reflect natural selection via differential predation on genetically determined, fixed phenotypes. Phenotypic variation, however, also can reflect within-generation developmental responses to environmental cues (phenotypic plasticity). For example, water-borne effluents from predators can induce the production of defensive morphologies in many prey taxa. This phenomenon, however, has been examined only on narrow scales. Here, we demonstrate adaptive phenotypic plasticity in prey from geographically separated populations that were reared in the presence of an introduced predator. Marine snails exposed to predatory crab effluent in the field increased shell thickness rapidly compared with controls. Induced changes were comparable to ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}i{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} ) historical transitions in thickness previously attributed to selection by the invading predator and ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}ii{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} ) present-day clinal variation predicted from water temperature differences. Thus, predator-induced phenotypic plasticity may explain broad-scale geographic and temporal phenotypic variation. If inducible defenses are heritable, then selection on the reaction norm may influence coevolution between predator and prey. Trade-offs may explain why inducible rather than constitutive defenses have evolved in several gastropod species. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

A group of potentially toxic elements was measured in blood and carcass samples of individual fish, as were ALA-D activity, total protein (TP), and hemoglobin (Hb) in blood. Concentrations of mining related metals (lead, zinc, and cadmium) were significantly greater (P {\textless} 0.05) in fish blood and carcass at sites affected by historic mining activities than at reference and active mining sites. When analyzed by multiple regression, ALA-D activity, Hb, and TP accounted for 66\% of blood-lead and 69\% of carcass-lead variability. Differences among species were small.

Biochemical differences among fish from different sites were also evident; concentrations of calcium, phosphorus and collagen were lower in the vertebrae of fish from some of the contaminated sites than at the reference site, and bone phosphorus was negatively correlated with concentrations of Pb in both muscle (r=-0.62) and blood (r=-0.75). Collectively, these results indicate that, in addition to the well-documented effects of Pb on haem synthesis, other important biochemical pathways may be disrupted by continuous low-level exposure to elemental contaminants.},

Defoliation plots of 15×15m were established on three sites, together with associated control stands of pure trembling aspen. In 2007, root collar diameters were measured and positions of all trees were mapped prior defoliation. Severe FTC defoliation was simulated for three successive years (2007-2009) by manually removing all leaves from all but 7-10\% of the trees present in the defoliation plots. Yearly surveys of growth and mortality were conducted until 2010 to evaluate defoliation effects on defoliated as well as surrounding undefoliated trees. In absence of other factors, growth and mortality of trembling aspen decreased and increased, respectively, after defoliation. Our study further revealed that small diameter trees died after one year of artificial defoliation, while larger-diameter trees died after repeated defoliations. Distributions of tree mortality tended to be aggregated at small scales ({\textless}5m), corroborating gap patterns observed in mature stands following FTC outbreaks. This experiment revealed that trembling aspen mortality can be directly attributed solely to defoliation. Repeated defoliations during FTC outbreaks have the potential to profoundly modify stand productivity and structure by reducing tree growth and increasing tree mortality in the absence of predisposing factors. © 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

	abstract = {The cultivation of fast-growing tree species in short rotation coppices has gained popularity in Germany in recent years. The resilience of these coppices to phyllophagous pest organisms is crucial for their profitable management, since the loss of a single annual increment can lead to uncompensable economic losses. To study the effects of leaf loss on the growth of poplar and willow varieties that are frequently cultivated under local conditions, three sample short rotation coppices including five poplar (Populus spp.) and three willow (Salix spp.) varieties were established in a randomized block design with four artificial defoliation variants and, on one site, with three different variants regarding the number of defoliation treatments. After up to three defoliation treatments within two growing seasons, the results show negative effects of leaf loss on the height growth and the fresh weight of the aboveground biomass of plants. Our data also suggests a lasting effect of defoliation on plant growth and re-growth after the end of the treatment. In general, defoliation had a greater impact on the growth of poplars than on willows. We conclude that even minor leaf loss can have an impact on plant growth but that the actual effects of defoliation clearly depend on the site, tree species, and variety as well as the extent and number of defoliations, which determine the ability of plants for compensatory growth.},

Five- and nine-year-old field trials were used to characterize the effects of artificial and natural aphid-induced (E. californica) defoliation, respectively, on shoot photosynthesis and growth. Photosynthetic capacity (A max) was significantly greater following a 25\% (D25) (13.8 μmol m -2 s -1) and a 50\% (D50) (15.9 μmol m -2 s -1) single-event upper-crown artificial defoliation, 3 weeks after defoliation than in undefoliated control trees (12.9 μmol m -2 s -1). This response was consistently observed for up to 11 weeks after the defoliation event; by Week 16, there was no difference in A max between control and defoliated trees. In the D50 treatment, this increased A max was not sufficient to fully compensate for the foliage loss as evidenced by the reduced diameter increment (by 15\%) in defoliated trees 36 weeks after defoliation. In contrast, diameter increment of trees in the D25 treatment was unaffected by defoliation. The A max of trees experiencing upper-crown defoliation by natural and repeated E. californica infestations varied, depending on host genotype. Despite clear differences in defoliation levels between resistant and susceptible genotypes (17 vs. 35\% of tree crown defoliated, respectively), growth of susceptible genotypes was not significantly different from that of resistant genotypes. The observed increases in A max in the lower crown of the canopy following attack suggested that susceptible genotypes were able to partly compensate for the loss of foliage by compensatory photosynthesis. The capacity of P. radiata to regulate photosynthesis in response to natural aphid-induced defoliation provides evidence that the impact of E. californica attack on stem growth will be less than expected, at least for up to 35\% defoliation. © The Author 2011.},

Control and defoliated seedlings showed similar patterns of cambial activity and timing of xylem differentiation, although fewer enlarging cells were observed in August to September in defoliated seedlings. Tree-ring widths were similar in control and defoliated seedlings, with thinner rings produced in the greenhouse in winter. No effect of defoliation on cell lumen area was observed, and effects on radial cell diameter and wall thickness were found only occasionally.

	abstract = {Defoliation from herbivores can reduce growth of affected plants, and this has been demonstrated for plantation-grown Eucalyptus globulus. We undertook a field study to examine: (1) the influence of severity, pattern and frequency of defoliation on E. globulus stem growth, (2) whether fertiliser application influences growth responses to defoliation and (3) whether rate or timing of fertiliser application is important in determining growth responses. Two rates of nitrogen (N) (100 or 300 kg ha-1) were applied either pre- or post-defoliation or both. Defoliation treatments examined the effects of pattern, frequency and severity of defoliation on growth. In the absence of fertiliser, removal of 25\% of leaf area from throughout the crown reduced diameter and height increment over the following 20 months. Removal of all leaf area from the upper 50\% of crown had a much more dramatic effect on stem growth than did removal of all leaf area from the lower 50\% of crown. More frequent defoliation increased the effect of defoliation on stem growth, and there was more of an effect following defoliation of the upper rather than lower crown. While there was no fertiliser response in undefoliated trees at the site, pre-defoliation fertiliser application maintained diameter and height increment of defoliated trees at a level similar to that of undefoliated trees. The growth response to fertiliser following defoliation was greater with pre- than post-defoliation applications of N, although there was still a significant response to post-defoliation applications. While foliar N content increased with rate of N application in undefoliated trees, defoliation generally reduced foliar N content and total phenolics. It was concluded that fertilising with N, even on sites with no discernible N deficiency, is a potential management tool for dealing with defoliation events. Management implications of the results are discussed. Crown Copyright © 2006.},

	abstract = {In most defoliation experiments with evergreen trees, leaves are removed proportionally across all leaf age classes or only the younger ones are removed. However, it remains unclear how the ecophysiological functions of older foliage potentially differ from those of younger leaves. Hence, we conducted a field experiment with five intensities of artificial defoliation (0\%, 11\% needle biomass loss = all ≥ 5-year-old needles removed, 27\% loss = all ≥ 4-year-old needles removed, 46\% loss = all ≥ 3-year-old needles removed, and 71\% loss = all ≥ 2-year-old needles removed) of Abies alba trees grown under low-light (LL, 28\% of full sunlight) and high-light conditions (HL, 70\%). Photosynthesis of the remaining one-year-old needles; concentrations of non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs = soluble sugars + starch), total nitrogen (N), and soluble protein (SP) in stem sapwood and one-year-old needles; and tree height and stem radial growth rates were measured. We found that growth light conditions, rather than old needle defoliation up to a needle biomass loss of 70\%, significantly affected growth, photosynthetic capacity and concentrations of tissue N, SP, and NSCs, with levels of all parameters greater in HL trees than in LL tress. Defoliation-induced compensatory growth was found in HL trees only, whereas tree height growth rates tended to decrease with increasing defoliation intensity in LL trees. Our results indicate that light availability, rather than damage to older foliage, plays an important role in determining plant physiology and growth. These results from A. alba trees suggest that the resource uptake by older foliage almost balances their resource consumption, leading to the conclusion that the older needles from evergreen trees physiologically contribute less to the whole-tree carbon and nitrogen balance. Our findings also suggest that the effects of older foliage defoliation on forest survival and productivity may have been overestimated in past forest ecosystem management practices, while the physiological functions of the youngest foliage may have been underestimated.},

When young shoots were inoculated by spray method under field conditions, defoliation occurred on more than 80\% of leaves when lesions covered as much as 10\% of leaf surface area. In leaves with the lesions more than 20\% of the leaf surface area, 100\% defoliation occurred. These figures corresponded approximately to one large lesion (4.5 mm in average diameter) per cm2 leaf or 15 to 20 lesions per mature leaf. Most of the leaves with the lesions covering less than 5\% of the total leaf surface area did not fall throughout the season. When the leaf infiltration method was applied to inocu-late leaves of young seedlings in greenhouse, leaf abscission was directly related to the leaf surface area covered with lesions. The most of defoliated leaves belonged to those with about 20\% leaf surface area covered with lesions. This was significantly larger than that in spray inoculation in field. The rate of absission increased when the site of inouclation was set in lower half of the leaf, particularly close to the joint of leaf blade to leaf stipule.},

Abstract The objective of this study was to determine if summer dormancy of the boxwood species Buxus sempervirens L. 'Suffruticosa', B. sempervirens 'Vardar Valley', and B. sinica var. insularis Nakai 'Justin Brouwers' could be overcome by pruning, defoliation or growth regulator applications. Promalin (benzyladenine (BA) + GA 4+7) alone and in combination with pruning increased new shoot growth; however, results were not consistent across experiments. Pruning alone (shearing or tip removal) was also inconsistent in inducing new shoot growth. Defoliation (removal of leaves from new spring growth) dramatically increased new shoot development, especially when applied ten weeks after spring budbreak instead of closer to budbreak. This response was tempored by Promalin application.},

	abstract = {Early fall (September) defoliation and late spring (early June) shading of "off" and "on" pistachio trees were used to test two hypotheses: that 1) fall defoliation would reduce carbohydrate storage sufficiently to suppress spring growth and 2) spring shading would reduce carbohydrate status and increase inflorescence bud abscission. Defoliation suppressed initial leaf area expansion the following spring on current year shoots of "off" but not "on" trees respectively. Suppression of leaf size was correlated with the initial low concentration of carbohydrates in organs of individual branches of the tree. Fruiting and artificial shading in June had more dramatic effects on growth parameters than defoliating. Shading "off" trees for 14 days in early June accelerated abscission of inflorescence buds, reduced dry mass of individual leaves, buds, current year and 1-year-old shoots. Shading also reduced the concentration of total nonstructural carbohydrates (TNC) of these organs in "off" and "on" trees. Fruiting suppressed leaf size and leaf dry mass by 20\% and 30\% among individual branches of undefoliated and defoliated trees respectively. Low carbohydrate concentrations in individual branches and inflorescence buds following shading were closely correlated with the abscission of inflorescence buds. Priestly 1988). Chemical inhibition of photosynthesis and shading induced fruit abscission in Prunus persica L., Batsch (peach) and Malus communis (apple) (Byers et al., 1984, 1985). Similarly, late season defoliation reduced carbohydrate reserves with particularly low concentrations in roots of deciduous trees (Oliveira and Priestly, 1988), apple shoots (Faby and Naumann, 1986) and Carya illinoiensis Wangeth (pecan) wood (Worley, 1979). Artificial shading at critical stages of fruit development increased fruit abscission as a result of a reduction in the carbohydrate contents of peach and apple fruit (Byers et al., 1984, 1985, 1991; Polomski et al., 1988). Whole-tree photosynthesis was reduced in apples to between 3\% and 25\% of normal using black polypropylene shade material and thereby decreased fruit numbers compared to sun exposed trees (Byers et al., 1991). The purpose of this work is to relate the effects of defoliation in the fall and shading in the summer on carbohydrate status which induces inflorescence bud abscission in pistachio. We contend that the first wave of bud abscission results from competition for assimilates between growing vegetative organs and inflorescence buds while the second wave represents competition between developing fruit and buds. Due to the built up storage reserves during fall in deciduous trees, defoliating trees immediately after harvest would lower carbohydrate concentrations in the trees to exacerbate this competition the following spring. Two hypotheses were tested: 1) fall defoliation would reduce carbohydrate storage sufficiently that subsequent spring growth parameters would be suppressed and 2) spring shading would reduce carbohydrate status and increase inflorescence bud abscis-sion. In most deciduous fruit species, few floral buds are produced in the year of a heavy crop. In contrast, maximum pistachio floral bud production occurs in heavy and light cropping years. Alternate bearing in pistachio trees results from summer abscission of more developing inflorescence buds on current year wood of "on" (carrying a heavy crop load) than "off" (carrying a light crop) trees. For "on" and "off" trees the first wave of inflorescence bud abscission which occurs between full bloom (FB) and FB+ 90 d is similar (≈30\% of total inflorescence buds) and is independent of presence of fruit. A second wave of abscission increases in intensity with increasing fruit load and is confined solely to "on" trees, resulting in an additional 60\% to 80\% abscission of the remaining buds (Crane and Iwakiri, 1981; Crane and Nelson, 1971; Porlingis, 1974). Reducing leaf area of a fruitless branch resulted in bud abscission which was similar to that occurring on bearing branches (Crane et al., 1973; Porlingis 1974). Additionally, varying fruit loads and leaf areas on bearing branches gave abscission effects similar to either reducing leaf areas alone or reducing number of fruit only. The importance of leaves after harvest and the influence of defoliation before natural leaf fall on reducing root growth, accumulation of reserves, and on the development of reproductive and vegetative buds in deciduous trees has been observed (Oliveira and},

Four trials were conducted to examine the impact of severity and time of foliar damage on fruit set and quality in apple. Trees tolerated light to moderate leaf damage throughout the season with no significant effect on fruit set and thus crop load. Where 75\% or more of the leaf surface was lost, fruit set was reduced and fruit quality was affected. Complete loss of leaves up to three weeks after full bloom (wAFB) resulted in very low or no fruit set, but from 9 wAFB crop load was not affected by leaf damage. Loss of terminal shoot leaves had no effect on fruit set, but spur leaves were critical early in the season with the impact lessening from 6 wAFB. This study has demonstrated that low levels of foliar damage have little effect on fruit size or quality, but high levels can impact on both set and quality. Fruit quality was reduced following leaf damage during the period 6-12 weeks after full bloom which is the critical period for cell division in the fruit as well as flower initiation for the following year. High levels of leaf damage also reduced fruit size in spite of reduced crop load levels, most likely the result of a reduction in carbohydrate assimilation during the cell division phase of fruit development.},

B.S.P.) from a nutrient-poor peatland in Alberta. Seasonal patterns of foliar nitrogen and phosphorus concentration and content were examined in six needle cohorts up to 10 years old. Trees were treated to simulate excess nutrient deficiency (removal of all one-year-old foliage), nutrient excess (fertilized with 250, 50, 100 kg ha-1 NPK split application in June and July), or left as controls. Gas exchange (net assimilation-Na, stomatal conductance-gs, mesophyll conductance-gin, water-use efficiency-WUE, dark respiration-RS) was measured on six different needle cohorts in several control trees in 1989 and 1990. Nitrogen and phosphorus concentration decreased with needle age. Foliar nutrient concentration fell from April to June and then was stable until September except for the fertilized trees where it increased. There was no evidence of greater than normal retranslocation of nutrients from older needles for defoliated trees or greater than normal nutrient loading in older needles of fertilized trees. NA, gs, gm, WUE, and RS were similar for all needles up to six or eight years old, these older needles having NA of 65\% of current needles and similar RS. The results do not support to conclusion that older needles of black spruce are retained as an adaptation to nutrient stress. It does not appear that older needles serve as a nutrient storage site in conditions of excess nutrient availability or a greater than normal nutrient source during times of excess nutrient deficiency. It appears that the maintenance of long-lived foliage in black spruce does not provide for greater flexibility in tree nutrient allocation. Their contribution to the carbon balance of the tree seems to be sufficient to explain their retention.},

Teleologically, the constant stress model states that a stem tapers to equalize stress produced by wind pressure along the stem.

We investigated the ability of these two models to describe the central stems of both mature and sapling Pinus contorta var. latifolia Engelm. We also tested whether these two models are active in petiole formation by systematically defoliating Trifolium pratense L. The constant stress model adequately described stem taper in both age classes of P. conlorta and the petiole form in T. pratense regardless of defoliation treatment. The elastic instability model was valid only for the mature P. contorta and for the control and perhaps for the moderately defoliated T. pratense. The constant stress model appears to be valid for both P. contorta and T. pratense while the elastic instability model is valid only for larger plants.},

Clonal plants are a common feature of heavily grazed ecosystems where large herbivores inflict the simultaneous pressures of trampling and defoliation on the vegetation. We test the hypothesis that physiological integration (resource sharing between interconnected ramets) may help plants to deal with the interactive effects of trampling and defoliation. Methods In a field study, small and large ramets of the root-suckering clonal tree Populus simonii were subjected to two levels of trampling and defoliation, while connected or disconnected to other ramets. Plant responses were quantified via survival, growth, morphological and stem mechanical traits. Key Results Disconnection and trampling increased mortality, especially in small ramets. Trampling increased stem length, basal diameter, fibrous root mass, stem stiffness and resistance to deflection in connected ramets, but decreased them in disconnected ones. Trampling decreased vertical height more in disconnected than in connected ramets, and reduced stem mass in disconnected ramets but not in connected ramets. Defoliation reduced basal diameter, leaf mass, stem mass and leaf area ratio, but did not interact with trampling or disconnection. Conclusions Although clonal integration did not influence defoliation response, it did alleviate the effects of trampling. We suggest that by facilitating resource transport between ramets, clonal integration compensates for trampling-induced damage to fine roots. © The Author 2012.},

Long-term common garden studies with Chinese tallow tree (Sapium sebiferum), a problematic invader in the southeastern United States, support EICA predictions of invasive ecotypes displaying rapid growth with poorly defended leaves, whereas native ecotypes are slower growing and have nitrogen rich, highly defended leaves. We conducted two full-factorial experiments designed to assess the effects of leaf herbivory and soil fertility on growth of Sapium seedlings derived from seeds obtained in the species' native Chinese range and introduced range along the Texas Gulf Coast. The first was a field study employing simulated defoliation to examine herbivory tolerance, while the second was a pot study using grasshopper bioassays to measure the compensatory regrowth of native and introduced Sapium ecotypes. In accordance with EICA predictions, introduced Texas ecotypes compensated for mechanical and natural defoliation regardless of resource conditions while growth of native Chinese ecotypes was significantly reduced as a result of both simulated and natural herbivory damage. These results demonstrate that invasive Sapium ecotypes have a greater capacity to compensate for herbivory damage than native Sapium ecotypes. The differences between Sapium ecotypes are consistent with the mechanisms of EICA and other findings demonstrating that invasive ecotypes have become herbivory tolerant due to post-introduction changes in tissue quality. © Springer 2005.},

	abstract = {Premise: Plants rely on pools of internal nonstructural carbohydrates (NSCs: soluble sugars plus starch) to support metabolism, growth, and regrowth of tissues damaged from disturbance such as foliage herbivory. However, impacts of foliage herbivory on the quantity and composition of NSC pools in long-lived woody plants are currently unclear. We implemented a controlled defoliation experiment on mature Tamarix spp.—a dominant riparian woody shrub/tree that has evolved with intense herbivory pressure—to test two interrelated hypotheses: (1) Repeated defoliation disproportionately impacts aboveground versus belowground NSC storage. (2) Defoliation disproportionately impacts starch versus soluble sugar storage. Methods: Hypotheses were tested by transplanting six Tamarix seedlings into each of eight cylinder mesocosms (2 m diameter, 1 m in depth). After 2.5 years, plants in four of the eight mesocosms were mechanically defoliated repeatedly over a single growing season, and all plants were harvested in the following spring. Results: Defoliation had no impact on either above- or belowground soluble sugar pools. However, starch in defoliated plants dropped to 55\% and 26\% in stems and roots, respectively, relative to control plants, resulting in an over 2-fold higher soluble sugar to starch ratio in defoliated plants. Conclusions: The results suggest that defoliation occurring over a single growing season does not impact immediate plant functions such as osmoregulation, but depleted starch could limit future fitness, particularly where defoliation occurs over multiple years. These results improve our understanding of how woody plants cope with episodic defoliation caused by foliage herbivory and other disturbances.},

	title = {Oecologia ({Berlin}) {Defoliation} increases nutritional quality and allelochemics of pine seedlings},
	abstract = {The concentration of phenols, procyanidins, and protein in pine foliage was determined at two and eight weeks following mechanical defoliation of 0, 25, 50, and 75\%. Changes in both mature and immature ponderosa pine, Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws, foliage were monitored. The lowest level of defoliation (25\%) produced the largest increase in phenols; 75 \% defoliation caused the largest increase in procyanidins. The number of phenolic compounds in mature foliage doubled following 25\% defolia-tion. Maximum protein production also occurred at moderate defoliation levels. Mechanical defoliation had a significant effect on the production of all compounds tested. The implications of these results for induced resistance research are discussed. The ability of plants to respond to herbivore attack by increasing concentrations of defensive compounds, induc-ible defenses, has received considerable interest in recent years. Research to date has focused on induction of defensive compounds; we report that foliage protein, as well as candidate defensive compounds, can be induced in pine seedlings. There is ample evidence that nitrogen is a limiting resource for herbivores (Mattson 1980). Consequently protein concentration, or a similar estimate of organic nitrogen, is a common measure of plant nutritional quality. Conversely , total plant phenols and procyanidins (polymeric phe-nolic compounds also called condensed tannins) are considered an index of poor nutritional quality (Levin 1971, Schultz and Baldwin 1982), and defend the plant against herbivores (Rhoades and Cates 1976, Feeny 1976). Recent evidence, however, suggests that phenols may also be used as nutrients by insects (Bernays and Woodhead 1982, Ber-nays et al. 1983). Materials and methods Eighty greenhouse-grown ponderosa pine seedlings (18 months old) were used for the experiment. A random-ized block experimental design was used. Pine seedlings were divided into four groups and randomly assigned to one of four treatments: 0, 25, 50, and 75\% defoliation. Defoliation was accomplished by removing the distal 25, Offprint requests to. M.R. Wagner 50, and 75\% of each needle with shears. Two weeks following defoliation 10 trees from each group were harvested and analyzed; the remainder were harvested at eight weeks. The two time periods were selected because they represented the approximate range of time larvae would be feeding on ponderosa pine in the field. At harvest all mature and immature needles were removed from each tree and immediately frozen at-20 {\textasciitilde} C. The needles were then clipped into 1 cm sections and freeze-dried at-50 {\textasciitilde} C and 50 millitorr in a Model 10-010 Virtis Automatic Freeze Dryer for 36 hours. The freeze-dried foliage samples were ground for 10 min in a Braun Mikro Dismembrator then treated four times with diethyl ether (10 mL) to extract resins and lipids. Resin and lipid free samples were then stored under dessication at-20 {\textasciitilde} C. Phenols, procyanidins, and proteins were extracted from the samples. Phenols were washed from the samples three times with 1.3 ml of acetone, procyanidins were washed from the samples three times with 1.3 ml of 70\% acetone water (v/v), and proteins were solubilized in 1.0 ml of 0.1 N NaOH for 24 h at room temperature. The phenol and pro-cyanidin extracts were centrifuged at {\textgreater} 2,500 rpm between each washing. The extracts were then pooled and evaporated to dryness at40 {\textasciitilde} C. The protein solution was centrifuged at {\textgreater} 2,500 rpm and an aliquot removed for analysis. Total phenols were analyzed according to Ribereau-Gayon (1972). Procyanidins and proteins were analyzed using a vanillin assay (Price et al. 1978) and the Coomassie Brilliant Blue dye technique (Bradford 1976), respectively.},

	abstract = {Changes in morphology and chemistry of leaf surface in response to herbivore damage may increase plant resistance to subsequent herbivore attack; however, there is lack of studies on induced responses of glandular trichomes and their exudates in woody plants and on effects of these changes on herbivores. We studied delayed induced responses in leaf surface traits of five clones of silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) subjected to various types of mechanical defoliation and simulated winter browsing. Glandular trichome density and concentrations of the majority of surface lipophilic compounds increased in trees defoliated during the previous summer. This induced response was systemic, since control branches in branch defoliated trees responded to the treatments similarly to defoliated branches, but differently from control trees. In contrast to defoliation treatments, simulated winter browsing reduced glandular trichome density on the following summer and had fewer effects on individual surface lipophilic compounds. Moreover, constitutive density of glandular trichomes was negatively correlated with induced total amount of lipophilic compounds per trichome, indicating a trade-off between constitutive and induced resistance in silver birch. Induced changes in leaf surface traits had no significant effect on leaf damage by chewers, miners and gall mites, but increased susceptibility of birch trees to aphids. However, leaf damage by chewers, miners and gall mites in defoliated (but not in control) trees was correlated with concentrations of some fatty acids and triterpenoids, although the direction of relationships varied among herbivore species. This indicates that induction of surface lipophilic compounds may influence birch resistance to herbivores. Our study thus demonstrated both specificity of elicitation of induced responses of birch leaf surface traits by different types of damage and specificity of the effects of these responses on different types of herbivores. © Springer-Verlag 2005.},

	title = {Foraging activity of an {Amazonian} leaf-cutting ant: responses to changes in the availability of woody plants and to previous plant damage},
	url = {http://about.jstor.org/terms},
	abstract = {This study investigates some factors affecting the foraging activity of the leaf-cutting ant Atta la-evigata. The study was conducted on an abandoned farm near Manaus, in Brazilian Amazonia, where forest was beginning to regenerate. I determined how temporal changes in the structure of the woody plant community (linked to the regeneration process) affected the leaf harvesting activity of this Neotropical ant. A 0.39-ha plot was established, and woody plants existing and emerging in this plot were identified, tagged, measured and mapped. At intervals of approximately 14 days all marked plants were checked to determine which had been attacked by A. laevigata during that period. Woody plant density doubled over the 18-months of the study. However, the number of plants attacked by A. laevigata, controlling for seasonal differences in ant activity, was independent of the number available for attack. The number of plants attacked was also independent of the number of new plants emerged in the previous 2 months. Apart from changes in total plant density, the relative abundance of most species also changed with time. Data on the composition of the plant community and on the composition of the ants' diet at different time intervals were subject to ordination analysis. The analyses revealed that successional changes in the composition of the woody plant community did significantly affect the composition of the leaf diet of A. laevigata. Variations in the ants' diet correlated most strongly with variations in the abundance of Bellucia imperialis. As this increased in abundance its relative contribution to the ants' diet increased. In addition, I observed a small decline in the diversity of plant resources exploited by the ants. B. imperialis was one of the species most preferred by A. laevigata, suggesting that variations in the diversity of its diet were related to the abundance of preferred species. The chances of an individual plant being attacked was independent of whether or not the plant had been attacked during the previous 5 months. This suggests that plant resistance against ant herbivory is not affected by previous damage. Two other lines of evidence also pointed to this. First, there was no significant difference in the leaf area cut (as measured during assays of leaf preference with A. laevigata) between leaves of plants that had been subject to artificial defoliation 3 mo earlier and those of control plants. Second, the number of attacks by A. laevigata on individuals of a given species usually followed a random distribution, even though a uniform or clumped distribution would have been expected under the hypothesis that damage by leaf-cutting ants affects the plant's resistance to further damage.},

Staphylococcus epidermidis with the highest percentage has the prominent role among coagulase-negative Staphylococci that is the most important reason of clinical infections. Due to various virulence factors and unique features, this microorganism is respected as a common cause of nosocomial infections. Because of potential ability in biofilm formation and colonization in different surfaces, also using of medical implant devices in immunocompromised and hospitalized patients the related infections have been increased. In recent decades the clinical importance and the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis strains have created many challenges in the treatment process. Staphylokokken sind ein Cluster Gram-positiver unbeweglicher nicht Sporen-bildender fakultativ anaerober Kokkenbakterien, die in die zwei Hauptgruppen Coagulase-positiv and Coagulase-negativ unterteilt werden. Staphylococcus epidermidis nimmt mit dem höchsten Anteil eine prominente Stellung unter den Coagulase-negativen Staphylokokken ein und ist die wichtigste Ursache klinisch manifester Infektionen. Auf Grund der verschiedenen Virulenzfaktoren und der besonderen Eigenschaften ist diese Species häufig Ursache nosokomialer Infektionen. Auf Grund der Fähigkeit zur Biofilmbildung und der Kolonisation auf verschiedenen Oberflächen sowie auf Grund des zunehmenden Einsatzes von Implantaten bei hospitalisierten und speziell bei immunkompromittierten Patienten ist ein Anstieg derartiger Infektionen zu verzeichnen.

The main free fatty acids of all mature cheese samples were hexanoic (short chain acid), lauric and myristic acid (medium chain acids) and palmitic acid (long chain acid).

	abstract = {Many plasmid vectors (e.g., the pUC series, Bluescript, pGem, and their derivatives) carry a short segment of Escherichia coli DNA containing the regulatory sequences and the coding information for the first 146 amino acids of β-galactosidase. Vectors of this type are used in host cells that express the carboxy-terminal portion of β-galactosidase. Although neither the host-encoded fragments nor the plasmid-encoded fragments of β-galactosidase are themselves active, they can associate to form an enzymatically active protein. This type of complementation, in which deletion mutants of the operator-proximal segment of the lacZ gene are complemented by β-galactosidase-negative mutants that have the operator-proximal region intact, is called α-complementation. The lac + bacteria that result from α-complementation are easily recognized because they form blue colonies in the presence of the chromogenic substrate X-Gal. However, insertion of a fragment of foreign DNA into the polycloning site of the plasmid almost invariably results in production of an amino-terminal fragment that is no longer capable of α-complementation. Bacteria carrying recombinant plasmids therefore form white colonies. To screen bacterial colonies, the chromogenic substrate X-Gal and the gratuitous inducer IPTG are mixed with suitable dilution of a culture, combined with molten top agar, and then spread on agar plates containing the appropriate antibiotic. The efficiency of transformation is slightly higher when the bacteria are plated in top agar rather than on the surface of agar plates. Perhaps the transformed bacteria prefer the slightly anaerobic state within the soft agar or the isosmolarity provided by the agar medium.},

	abstract = {Two super-repressor mutations in the histidine utilization (hut) operons of Salmonella typhimurium are described. Cells bearing either of these mutations have levels of hut enzymes that do not increase above the uninduced levels when growth is in the presence of either histidine or the gratuitous inducer imidazole propionate. Both mutations lie in the region of the gene for the hut repressor, hutC, and reverse mutations of both are to the constitutive (repressor-negative) rather than to the inducible (wild type) phenotype. In hybrid merodiploid strains the super-repressor mutations are dominant over either wild-type (hutC+) or repressor-negative (hutC-) alleles. Whereas both super-repressor mutations cause the uninducible synthesis of hut enzymes, the degree of repression is different. One mutation causes repression of enzyme synthesis in one of the two hut operons to a level below the basal, uninduced level of wild-type cells. The other mutation causes repression to a lesser degree than in wild-type cells, so that the hut enzymes are present at a level above the normal basal level; this partially constitutive synthesis is greater for the enzymes of one of the hut operons than for the enzymes of the other. Thus, both mutations apparently result in repressors with altered operator-binding properties, in addition to altered inducer-binding properties.},

	abstract = {An electron microscopy study has been made of the effects of dissolution of the plasma membrane of Escherichia coli with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) on the organization of the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm. The alterations observed in time course experiments were related to absorbance changes and to release of macromolecules from the cells. As the cells became plasmolyzed, under the conditions used, the first visible effect of SDS was a collapse of the plasmolysis spaces. This was accompanied by a displacement of the nuclear material which then appeared in broad contact with the redeployed plasma membrane. This initial displacement of nuclear material to the cell border may indicate an association between the nucleoplasm and the plasma membrane. Upon further dissolution of the plasma membrane, the nuclear material receded from the cell margin and contracted into an axial filament. Meanwhile, the cytoplasm dissociated into an amorphous, Pronase-sensitive component and an electron-opaque, granular one sensitive to ribonuclease. The latter represented one continuous area of ribosomal structures surrounding the nucleoplasm, an organization which did not occur when the cells were inhibited with rifamycin before SDS treatment. During prolonged SDS interaction, approximately 65\% of the cellular protein, 25\% of the ribonucleic acid and 40\% of the deoxyribonucleic acid were released from the cells concomitant with the disappearance of the amorphous cytoplasmic part, expansion of the ribosomal aggregate, and rearrangement of the nuclear material at the cell periphery. The observations support the contention that all ribosomal structures bear a direct relationship with the nucleoplasm.},

	abstract = {We study here the effect on phage T7 RNA polymerase activity of lac repressor bound downstream of the T7 promoter. When repressor binds in vitro at an operator centered at +13 or +15 with respect to transcription start, it does not prevent initiation, though the transcript yield is reduced. However, the processivity of the polymerase is depressed and transcript extension is blocked at positions +4 and +6, respectively. These results indicate that repressor and polymerase do not simply exclude each other from the promoter. Rather, they would come into steric conflict and compete for establishment or retention of interactions with the same segment of DNA, without this leading to the immediate displacement of either polymerase or repressor. The resulting destabilization of the transcription complex would depress both initiation rate and enzyme processivity. In contrast to the above results, little reduction in runoff transcription is observed when operator is centered at +47. The decreased sensitivity of polymerase to repressor bound at +47 versus +13 or +15 is likely to be due to the higher stability of the elongation complex during the transcription of downstream regions in comparison with the first transcribed nucleotides. We also show that under conditions of leaky repression and with operator centered at +13, a mutant T7 RNA polymerase showing normal promoter affinity but a slower elongation rate is more sensitive to repression than the wild-type enzyme, both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, this higher sensitivity is largely due to a reduced ability of the mutant to overcome the elongation block at position +4. The parallel between the in vitro and in vivo data suggests that in vivo the repressor also does not prevent polymerase from binding to promoter, but interferes with subsequent steps in initiation and transcript extension, in this case presumably largely extension beyond +4.},

The results of the experiments gave effectiveness factors of 0.3 for ONPG, 0.6 to 0.7 for lactose in solution, andclose to unity for lactose in milk. Using a coupled mass transfer and kinetic model, it was possible to estimate the permeability of the microcapsule membrane from the reactor data. Membrane permeabilities on the order of 5 × 10−3 and 3 × 10−4 cm/sec were estimated for ONPG and lactose, respectively. It was determined that the membrane was the limiting mass transfer resistance for the overallreaction.

The superiority of the O.N.P.G. test in the number of positive results and its rapidity is shown. In general, late or non-lactose fermenting strains of genera, usually lactose-positive, yield a rapidly positive O.N.P.G. reaction. Forty-one wild strains of Salmonella, Proteus, Providencia, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were found negative in all three tests. Of 1,075 stock strains of Salmonella examined in the O.N.P.G. test, all were negative except nine; four of these were lactose-positive strains. For practical purposes, Salmonella strains in Great Britain may be regarded as O.N.P.G. negative. Among 100 stock strains of Arizona there was considerable variation of behaviour in the O.N.P.G. test and in the 5\% and 1\% lactose tests. Most strains of Arizona can be considered to yield a positive O.N.P.G. test but a minority give a negative result. The test is recommended for routine use in the differentiation of Salmonella from other enterobacteria and for use in bacterial identification. The 5\% lactose fermentation test in parallel is suggested when the O.N.P.G. test is used for isolating routine pathogens, because organisms such as Shigella sonnei, Shigella dysenteriae 1, and Pasteurella pseudotuberculosis are O.N.P.G. positive.},

	abstract = {Apoptosis is orchestrated by caspases, a family of cysteine proteases that cleave their substrates on the carboxy-terminal side of specific aspartic acid residues. These proteases are generally present in healthy cells as inactive zymogens, but when stimulated they undergo autolytic cleavage to become fully active. They subsequently cleave their substrates at one or two specific sites, which can result in activation, inactivation, relocalization, or remodeling of the substrate. Consequently, many of the cleaved fragments remain intact during apoptosis and can be detected using substrate-specific antibodies. These fragments are most commonly detected by western blotting, which resolves proteins and their fragments based on molecular mass. However, antibodies that only recognize cleaved fragments can be used to specifically label cells in which caspase cleavage has occurred. It is then possible to quantify these cells by flow cytometry. A number of antibodies that specifically recognize caspase-cleaved fragments have been generated, including antibodies that recognize the cleaved form of caspase-3. This caspase is responsible for the majority of proteolysis during apoptosis, and detection of cleaved caspase-3 is therefore considered a reliable marker for cells that are dying, or have died by apoptosis. This protocol outlines the quantification of apoptosis by flow cytometric detection of cleaved caspase-3.},

	abstract = {The proportions of aneuploid/polyploid versus euploid cells formed after treatment with spindle poisons like nocodazole are of course dependent on the relative survival of cells with numerical chromosome aberrations. This work aimed at studying the survival of polyploid cells formed after treatment with a nocodazole concentration sufficient to significantly decrease tubulin polymerization (0.1 μg/ml). First, normal primary lymphocytes were analysed and the following complementary chromosomal parameters were quantified: mitotic index, frequency of abnormal mitoses, polyploid metaphases and apoptotic cells. The results clearly indicate a positive correlation between abnormal mitotic figures, apoptosis and the induction of polyploidy. They therefore led to a single cell approach in which both apoptosis and polyploidy induction could be scored in the same cell. For this purpose, actively proliferating cells are required and two human leukaemic cell lines were used, KS (p53-positive) and K562 (p53-negative), which have a near-triploid karyotype. Cells were separated into an apoptotic and a viable fraction by means of annexin-V staining and how cytometry. In KS, treatment with nocodazole induced a similar fraction of hexaploid cells in both the viable and apoptotic fraction, but no dodecaploid cells were ever observed. In contrast, a population of dodecaploid cells (essentially viable) was clearly observed in the K562 cell line. The results in KS, as compared with K562, confirm that wild-type p53 can prevent further cycling of polyploid cells by blocking rereplication. The most probable explanation for these data is that not only the mitotic spindle but also interphase microtubules are sensitive to nocodazole treatment. Our data thus strongly suggest that besides the G1/S checkpoint under the control of p53, the G2/M transition may be sensitive to depolymerization of microtubules, possibly under the control of Cdc2, Bcl-2, Raf-1 and/or Rho.},

It was first synthesized in 1966 and approved for cancer therapy in 1983 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (Hande, 1998). Starting from 1980s several studies demonstrated that etoposide targets DNA topoisomerase II activities thus leading to the production of DNA breaks and eliciting a response that affects several aspects of cell metabolisms. In this review we will focus on molecular mechanisms that account for the biological effect of etoposide.},

	abstract = {Treatment of L929 fibroblasts by the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide killed 50\% of the cells within 72 h. The cell killing was preceded by the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. Simultaneous treatment of the cells with wortmannin, cycloheximide, furosemide, cyclosporin A, or decylubiquinone prevented the release of cytochrome c and significantly reduced the loss of viability. Etoposide caused the phosphorylation of p53 within 6 h, an effect prevented by wortmannin, an inhibitor of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). The activation of p53 by etoposide resulted in the up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax, a result that was prevented by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. The increase in the content of Bax was followed by the translocation of this protein from the cytosol to the mitochondria, an event that was inhibited by furosemide, a chloride channel inhibitor. Stably transfected L929 fibroblasts that overexpress Akt were resistant to etoposide and did not translocate Bax to the mitochondria or release cytochrome c. Bax levels in these transfected cells were comparable with the wild-type cells. The release of cytochrome c upon translocation of Bax has been attributed to induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). Cyclosporin A and decylubiquinone, inhibitors of MPT, prevented the release of cytochrome c without affecting Bax translocation. These data define a sequence of biochemical events that mediates the apoptosis induced by etoposide. This cascade proceeds by coupling DNA damage to p53 phosphorylation through the action of DNA-PK. The activation of p53 increases Bax synthesis. The translocation of Bax to the mitochondria induces the MPT, the event that releases cytochrome c and culminates in the death of the cells.},

Etoposide and camptothecin induced apoptosis of mitogen-activated but not resting CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. Cell sensitivity to these agents required G1 to S-phase transition of the cell cycle. Conversely, daunorubicin, an intercalating agent and topoisomerase II inhibitor, induced apoptosis of both resting and activated lymphocytes. Although etoposide and camptothecin induced CD95-ligand mRNA expression, drug-induced apoptosis of activated human lymphocytes was not inhibited by CD95 antagonists. Drug-induced cell death was also not inhibited by p55 TNFR-Ig fusion protein. Activation of the caspases cascade was suggested by the partial inhibitory effect of the tripeptide zVAD-fmk and documented by activation of caspase 3. Finally etoposide and camptothecin induced a rapid production of ceramide in activated but not resting peripheral blood lymphocytes, suggesting that ceramide might initiate the signaling apoptotic cascade in sensitive cells.},

Induction of apoptosis results in a cascade of characteristic biochemical events resulting in changes in cellular morphology and death. Cells undergoing apoptosis display blebbing, cell shrinkage, nuclear fragmentation, and DNA fragmentation. In contrast to necrosis, apoptotic cells form apoptotic bodies that are phagocytized by neighboring cells, without the release of cellular contents. Apoptosis plays important roles in physiology and pathology, and can be triggered by numerous stimuli, including ischemia, hypoxia, exposure to certain drugs and chemicals, immune reactions, infectious agents, high temperature, radiation, and various disease states.},

RNase E is a large multidomain protein with an N-terminal catalytic region and a C-terminal noncatalytic region that is mostly natively unstructured protein. The noncatalytic region contains sites for binding RNA and for protein-protein interactions with other components of the RNA degradosome. Several recent studies suggest that there are alternative forms of the RNA degradosome depending on growth conditions or other factors. These alternative forms appear to modulate RNase E activity in the degradation of mRNA. RNA degradosome-like complexes appear to be conserved throughout the Proteobacteria, but there is a surprising variability in composition that might contribute to the adaptation of these bacteria to the enormously wide variety of niches in which they live.},

	doi = {10.1016/J.BMC.2013.09.008},
	abstract = {We studied the influence of structurally different saponins on the cholesterol content of cellular membranes. Therefore a cell culture model using ECV-304 urinary bladder carcinoma cells was developed. To measure the cholesterol content we used radiolabeled 3H-cholesterol which is chemically and physiologically identical to natural cholesterol. The cells were pre-incubated with 3H-cholesterol and after a medium change, they were treated with saponins to assess a saponin-induced cholesterol liberation from the cell membrane. In another experiment the cells were pre-incubated with saponins and after a medium change, they were treated with 3H- cholesterol to assess a saponin-induced inhibition of cholesterol uptake into the cell membrane. Furthermore, the membrane toxicity of all applied saponins was analyzed using extracellular LDH quantification and the general cytotoxicity was analyzed using a colorimetric MTT-assay and DNA quantification. Our results revealed a correlation between membrane toxicity and general cytotoxicity. We also compared the results from the experiments on the saponin-induced cholesterol liberation as well as the saponin-induced inhibition of cholesterol uptake with the membrane toxicity. A significant reduction in the cell membrane cholesterol content was noted for those saponins who showed membrane toxicity (IC50 {\textless}60 μM). These potent membrane toxic saponins either liberated 3H-cholesterol from intact cell membranes or blocked the integration of supplemented 3H-cholesterol into the cell membrane. Saponins with little influence on the cell membrane (IC50 {\textgreater}100 μM) insignificantly altered the cell membrane cholesterol content. The results suggested that the general cytotoxicity of saponins is mainly dependent on their membrane toxicity and that the membrane toxicity might be caused by the loss of cholesterol from the cell membrane. We also analyzed the influence of a significantly membrane toxic saponin on the cholesterol content of intracellular membranes such as those of endosomes and lysosomes. In these experiments ECV-304 cells were either incubated with 3H-cholesterol or with 3H-cholesterol and 5 μM saponin. After isolation of the endosomes/lysosomes their 3H-cholesterol content was measured. A significant influence of the saponins on the cholesterol content of endosomal/lysosomal membranes was not detected. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Tubular endosomes were induced by BFA both apically and basolaterally in some MDCK cells, comparable with those seen in HEp-2 and T47D cells. In addition, in MDCK cells, BFA induced formation of small ({\textless} 300 nm) vesicles, labeled both after apical and basolateral uptake of HRP, as well as some very large ({\textgreater} 700 nm) vacuoles, which were only labeled when HRP was present in the apical medium. In contrast, neither in MDCK nor in HEp-2 or T47D cells, did BFA have any effect on lysosomal morphology. Moreover, transcytosis in the basolateral-apical direction was stimulated both for HRP and ricin. Other vesicular transport routes were less affected or unaffected by BFA treatment. Two closely related structural analogues of BFA (B16 and B21), unable to produce the changes in Golgi and endosomal morphology seen after BFA treatment in a number of different cell lines, were also unable to mimic the effects of BFA on MDCK cells.},

	abstract = {Recruitment of the Golgi-specific AP-1 adaptor complex onto Golgi membranes is thought to be a prerequisite for clathrin coat assembly on the TGN. We have used an in vitro assay to examine the translocation of cytosolic AP-1 onto purified Golgi membranes. Association of AP-1 with the membranes required GTP or GTP analogues and was inhibited by the fungal metabolite, brefeldin A. In the presence of GTP gamma S, binding of AP-1 to Golgi membranes was strictly dependent on the concentration of cytosol added to the assay. AP-1 recruitment was also found to be temperature dependent, and relatively rapid at 37 degrees C, following a lag period of 3 to 4 min. Using only an adaptor-enriched fraction from cytosol, purified myristoylated ARF1, and Golgi membranes, the GTP gamma S-dependent recruitment of AP-1 could be reconstituted. Our results show that the association of the AP-1 complex with Golgi membranes, like the coatomer complex, requires ARF, which accounts for the sensitivity of both to brefeldin A. In addition, they provide the basis for a model for the early biochemical events that lead to clathrin-coated vesicle formation on the TGN.},

	abstract = {{\textgreater} Au cours du développement tumoral, les cellules malignes reprogramment leur métabolisme pour répondre à la demande en biosynthèses conditionnant l'augmentation de leur biomasse et pour s'adapter aux propriétés de leur microenvironnement. Les avancées récentes de la recherche ont révélé l'étonnante flexibilité des cellules cancéreuses qui alternent entre un métabolisme glycolytique aérobie (appelé effet Warburg) et un métabolisme oxydatif en fonction de leurs conditions de développement, une plasticité métabolique requérant une mutualisation de leurs ressources énergétiques. Dans cette revue, nous présentons ces nouvelles découvertes et discutons d'un modèle décrivant la tumeur comme un écosystème métabolique évolutif tout en insistant sur les applications thérapeutiques qui en découlent. {\textless} nouveau champ disciplinaire extrême-ment dynamique visant à comprendre comment la reprogrammation métabo-lique, considérée aujourd'hui comme une propriété fondamentale des cel-lules malignes (et intégrée en 2011 dans la mise à jour des « Hallmarks of cancer » [3]), constitue une étape incontournable du processus de transformation. Les raisons qui ont poussé les chercheurs, dont les auteurs de cette revue, à ré-ouvrir leur manuel de biochimie et à sonder les voies métaboliques du cancer constituent d'ailleurs une question très instructive d'histoire des sciences et de sociologie de la connaissance qui commence seulement à être étudiée [4]. En l'honneur de son découvreur, l'activation de la glycolyse en condition aérobie a été baptisée « effet Warburg », et en même temps que ce pro-cessus était admis, il est devenu un paradoxe à résoudre : pourquoi les cellules malignes ayant, a priori, un besoin accru d'ATP pour proliférer, n'utilisent-elles pas la voie OXPHOS, dont le rendement énergétique est nettement supérieur (Figure 2) ? On sait aujourd'hui que l'explication ne réside pas dans une altération de la fonction mitochondriale, comme le pensait Warburg. Les mitochondries respirent en effet dans la plupart des types de cellules cancéreuses, et elles four-nissent les intermédiaires carbonés du cycle de Krebs nécessaires aux biosynthèses (un processus appelé cataplérose) [5-7] (➜). En contrepartie, le cycle de Krebs doit être constamment réapprovi-sionné, en particulier en oxaloacéate via la pyruvate carboxylase, et 1 Équipe labellisée par la Ligue nationale contre le cancer, Clinical and experimental model of lymphomagenesis, Univ Lyon,},

	abstract = {Cyanobacterial toxins are among the hazardous substances most widely found in water. They occur naturally, but concentrations hazardous to human health are usually due to human activity. Therefore, to protect human health, managing lakes, reservoirs and rivers to prevent cyanobacterial blooms is critical. This second edition of Toxic Cyanobacteria in Water presents the current state of knowledge on the occurrence of cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins as well as their impacts on health through water-related exposure pathways, chiefly drinking-water and recreational activity. It provides scientific and technical background information to support hazard identification, assessment and prioritisation of the risks posed by cyanotoxins, and it outlines approaches for their management at each step of the water-use system. It sets out key practical considerations for developing management strategies, implementing efficient measures and designing monitoring programmes. This enables stakeholders to evaluate whether there is a health risk from toxic cyanobacteria and to mitigate it with appropriate measures. This book is intended for those working on toxic cyanobacteria with a specific focus on public health protection. It intends to empower professionals from different disciplines to communicate and cooperate for sustainable management of toxic cyanobacteria, including public health workers, ecologists, academics, and catchment and waterbody managers.

	abstract = {A review about lake naturally eutrophicating, the internal loading of nutrients from lake sediment as well as the mechanism of algal blooms and the control practices was made, especially the eutrophication problem of shallow lakes since seventy percent of fresh water lakes in China are shallow lakes. It was found that shallow lakes are apt toward eutrophication than deep lakes. Without any influences of human activity, shallow lakes in the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River are still easily eutrophicated, which may be owing to the effects of flood in this area. In shallow lakes, sediments are frequently disturbed by wind-wave and resuspended, which result in huge nutrients release to overlying water. This may be the major reason for higher internal loading of nutrients in shallow lakes than in deep lakes. Algal bloom is an extreme response of lake ecosystem to the eutrophication. Appearance of algal blooms is related to physical condition of lakes, such as underwater radiation (or transparency), temperature, and hydrodynamic conditions, or related to geochemical conditions of lakes, like concentrations of nutrients and ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus, as well as the physiological advantage of cyanobacteria such as vacuole for moving towards the radiant energy-rich zone and the mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) for resisting the harm of ultraviolet radiation. In shallow lakes, these advantages of cyanobacteria are favorable in the competition than in deep lakes. Also being the shallowness, it is more difficult to reduce nutrient loading and to control algae blooms in shallow lakes. For the control of eutrophication, people should follow the sequence from pollution sources control, ecological restoration to catchment management. To control the internal nutrient release, physical, chemical, biological techniques, and even bionic techniques could be selected. The idea of ecological restoration for a eutrophic lake is to shift the ecosystem from phytoplankton-dominant state to macrophyte-dominant state. To realize the shift of ecosystem state, environmental condition improvement is the fundamental work. Nowadays, we should do more work on environmental condition improvement than on planting of macrophytes since we are lack of the knowledge about the relationship between macrophyte and lake ecosystem. Emphasizing the macrophyte planting, therefore, has blindness at present. Because all lakes have different characteristics of environment and ecosystem, applicable lake harness techniques should be selected based on the distinct ecosystem types and environmental problems.},

Integrating insights from the critical geographer David Harvey, the authors demonstrate how the dispossession of land and language threaten health and well-being and worsen existing illness conditions. Drawing on the qualitative findings from a program of communitybased research with the 'Namgis First Nation in the Canadian province of British Columbia, the authors argue for an account of how neoliberal mechanisms operate to further the "accumulation by dispossession" associated with historical and ongoing colonialism. Specifically, they show how neoliberal ideologies operate to sustain medical colonialism and health inequities for Indigenous peoples.

Heights and diameters of seedlings grown with crabgrass were reduced 33 and 50\%, respectively, compared with seedlings grown in pine monoculture. Furthermore, survival of seedlings was reduced by 16\% in the mixed species treatments compared with pine monoculture cells. Soil water contents at all depths were at least 50\% lower in mixed species treatments compared with pine monocultures during a dry-down cycle. Maximum loblolly pine root extension rate was 0.10 m wk-1 in pine monoculture compared with 0.02 m wk-1 in the presence of grass. Pine seedling root extension ceased in the presence of grass during prolonged periods of induced water stress. Crabgrass roots extended at a rate of 0.6 m wk-1, a rate largely unaffected by watering regime or differences in water content within the rhizotron. Pine root distributions, at the end of one growing season, were different for seedlings grown with grass than for those in pine monoculture; however, when seedlings of similar size were compared, root distributions were not different. Our results indicate that competition-induced reductions in soil water availability reduced the rate of pine root extension and thus the volume of soil exploited, thereby reducing resource availability and tree growth.},

	abstract = {An energy balance approach is applied to simulate snow accumulation and melt in a forest clearing and in a coniferous forest. The study site is located in southern Finland (60.1°N) where the winters are mild considering the high latitude. For forest simulations the snow model is coupled with a procedure, which accounts for the effects of the canopy on the driving meteorological variables of the snow model. Model results are first validated against measured values of snow water equivalent and snow temperature in a forested site and in an adjacent clearing. Subsequently differences in snow accumulation, snowmelt, and energy components contributing to snowmelt in open and forested conditions are studied. Effect of the canopy on snow mass balance on the ground can be seen as higher accumulation and more intense snowmelt in the open. Due to these counteracting processes the results show little difference in the annual maximum of the snow water equivalent between the clearing and the forest. The model results suggest that in mid-winter the main source of energy for snowmelt is sensible heat in the open, whereas both sensible heat and net radiation contribute equally to snowmelt in the forest. Solar radiation intensity increases towards the spring, which causes net radiation to become dominant in both sites. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Snow accumulation patterns were determined for clearings and adjacent forest at Marmot Creek experimental watershed and James River, Alberta. At maximum accumulation snow water equivalent (SWE) was greater in clearings than in forest whether clearings were large, as in 8- to 13-ha blocks where SWE averaged 20\% more than in the forest, or small as in the 1/4 to 6-H (height) diameter circular clearings where SWE was 13-45\% greater than in the forest. SWE was 42 to 52\% less in north than in south sectors of 2-6 H clearings. These differences increased with clearing size and time since beginning of accumulation period and are caused by snow ablation (melt and evaporation), a function of direct solar radiation reaching the snowl•ack. In such situations the snow that has accumulated on the ground cannot be considered a measure of the snow that has actually fallen there. For water balances and hydrologic modeling, snow measurements in partially cleared watersheds must be adjusted for temporal and spatial factors specific to the watershed. INTRODUCTION},

	abstract = {The study of the relationship between species richness of a plant community and its productivity has received much attention, recently renewed by the concern on the loss of biological diversity at a global scale. Here, we briefly review some indices widely used in agronomic and competition experiments to compare monocultures and mixtures, and compare them to other, more recently designed ones. These various indices are then calculated for two experiments. In the first experiment, two grass and two legume species were grown at six levels of nitrogen availability, either in monocultures or in mixtures of the four species in a substitutive design; in the second experiment, five grass species were grown at 16 levels of total nutrient availability, either in monocultures or in mixtures of the five species in an additive design. These data clearly show that the conclusions drawn from the experiments depend on the index used to compare the experimental communities. We argue that a clear test of whether the productivity of communities increases with species richness requires that: (1) all species present in the multispecies assemblages also be grown in monocultures under the same environmental conditions, and (2) the productivity of these assemblages be compared to the most productive monoculture. We conclude that there are as yet very few cases where superior productivity of multispecies assemblages as compared to monocultures has been clearly shown.},

There were large interspecific differences in forest floor depth and mass, in the size and distribution of C and N pools at varying soil depths, and in rates of midsummer net N mineralization and nitrification. Forest floor mass ranged from 3.2 kg/m2 to 11.0 kg/m2 and was smallest beneath sugar maple and largest beneath hemlock. The pool size of C in the forest floor ranged from 1.1 kg/m2 to 4.4 kg/m2 while the N content of the forest floor ranged from 83 g/m2 to 229 g/m2. Forest floor C and N pools were smallest beneath sugar maple and highest beneath hemlock. Soil C:N ratios (range: 14.8-19.5) were lower beneath sugar maple, red maple, and white ash than beneath beech, red oak, and hemlock, whereas the opposite was true of the midsummer rate of net N mineralization (range: 0.91-2.02 g · m2 · 28 d-1). The rate of net nitrification was positively correlated with the rate of net N mineralization. Interspecific differences in litter production and quality explain the large differences among species in the size of the forest floor C and N pools and in net N mineralization rates. The differences in the size and distribution of C and N pools beneath the different species suggest that the mechanisms regulating the process of species replacement in these forests will mediate the effects of anthropogenic, environmental changes in soil C and N dynamics.},

Such changes may alter the sustainability of these uneven-aged ecosystems. The hypothesis that the decline observed in sugar maple populations over recent decades has modified stand structure and composition was tested using data from the Forest Ecosystem Research and Monitoring Network (RESEF) in Québec, Canada. Analysis of the diameter class density distribution, growth rates, and mortality schedule for 12 stands indicated a decline in health and productivity in the sugar maple population. This result suggests that environmental factors have limited the development of this species in all strata. The American beech population responded by doubling its pole cohort density in 10 years. Although increases in American beech stem density tended to counter sugar maple mortality, results suggest that stand structure has been shifted from a sustainable structure to an unsustainable one over a 10-year period. The high mortality of sugar maple and the large increase of pole-size beech trees deeply altered forest structure and composition in the majority of stands studied. These changes question seriously the sustainability of sugar maple in these forest ecosystems. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In order to disentangle if and when resource supply and adult and young-of-the-year (0+) fish predation affect zooplankton dynamics during spring, we monitored zooplankton during three consecutive years in a lake in southern Sweden. We also experimentally assessed 0+ fish predation rates and estimated changes in predation rates of adult fish on zooplankton. Decline in abundances of large-sized zooplankters in early spring was not caused by 0+ fish predation. Instead, this decline was most likely a combined result of size-selective predation from adult fish (stationary in the lake and from those returning from surrounding streams) and competition for diminishing algal food resources. On the other hand, the decline in medium-sized zooplankton in the lake during spring was strongly affected by 0+ fish. Hence, during spring, zooplankton are facing predation both from adult fish selecting large prey and from 0+ fish, which start feeding on small-sized prey and eventually switch to larger. Neither predation by different ontogenetic stages of fish (adult and 0+) nor resource supply shape the zooplankton spring dynamics, but rather they affect the timing and strength of these events. 0+ cyprinids tend to have stronger effect on zooplankton dynamics than other taxa of 0+ fish. A combination of predation from adult and 0+ fish during spring is the main mechanism behind the crash of the zooplankton community, which in many lakes leads to the termination of the clear-water phase. © 2007, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

Our findings demonstrate that, for small warm-water lakes containing predominantly centrarchids and percids, the size composition of the zooplankton community and growth and size structure of the fish community are closely correlated. Spatial-temporal differences between lakes suggest the fishery manager can obtain a useful measure of zooplankton size by sampling at deeper, offshore sites in August. Measurement of zooplankton size as an index of predator-prey balance in the fish community offers a simple, yet economical, approach for assessing the status of a fish population and determining management options. Comparisons of Fee's productivity index, zooplankton biomass, and catches of fish in variable-mesh gill nets indicate that lakes with a high productivity index generally support a larger biomass of planktivorous fish. Finally, evaluation of fish communities through assessment of zooplankton populations and measures of lake productivity has sound potential for future investigations and provides a rational basis for developing fish-management strategies.},

An increase in the predator-to-panfish ratio was matched by an increase in zooplankton size, indicating that zooplankton size represents a suitable index of predator-prey balance. Mean zooplankton size also decreased as the abundance of age-0 fish increased and increased when the predator: panfish ratio increased after a successful introduction of piscivores. To assess fish community structure from mean size of crustacean zooplankton, we recommend that sampling for zooplankton be done once in the spring and once in midsummer.},

	abstract = {The size-efficiency hypothesis, first proposed in 1965 by Brooks \& Dodson (24), has profoundly influenced the direction of research in aquatic ecology since its publica-tion.3 The size-efficiency hypothesis (SEH) is an attempt to explain the commonly observed inverse relationship between the abundances of small- and of large-bodied herbivorous zooplankton in freshwater lakes. The SEH was originally stated as follows: 1. Planktonic herbivores all compete for the fine particulate matter (1 to 15 L) of the open waters. 2. Larger zooplankters do so more efficiently and can also take larger particles. 3. Therefore, when predation is of low intensity the small planktonic herbivores will be competitively eliminated by large forms (dominance of large Cladocera and calanoid copepods). 4. But when predation is intense, size-dependent predation will eliminate the large forms, allowing the small zooplankters (rotifers, small Cladocera) that escape preda-tion to become the dominants. 5. When predation is of moderate intensity, it will, by falling more heavily upon the larger species, keep the populations of these more effective herbivores sufficiently low so that slightly smaller competitors are not eliminated. In the decade since this attractively simple and general hypothesis first appeared, few people have paused, as we do here, to consider the validity of its assumptions, examine its implications graphically, or provide a critical overview in light of accumulating data. Initially, we express algebraically the instantaneous increase rate of a zooplankton population as a function of several components of size-dependent competition. Next we characterize size-dependent predation and focus on its in-teraction with interspecific competition; then we analyze graphically their potential roles in structuring limnetic zooplankton communities. Finally, we note some impli-cations of the SEH and of our analysis for community-level theory in ecology.},

Twelve 50-m 2 in situ experimental enclosures were installed in degraded Cootes Paradise Marsh during the carp spawning period in 1995. Enclosures were stocked with two or three carp of similar size, ranging from 13 to 59 cm and in total biomass from 23 to 2100 kg/ha. Turbidity, total phosphorus, and total ammonia concentrations increased predictably with total carp biomass in the enclosures. Although carp had no direct effect on zooplankton community structure, increased turbidity and nutrient load associated with carp activity resulted in reduced total zooplankton biomass. We developed a relationship between species richness and water turbidity for 19 wetlands in the Great Lakes basin which indicated that above an apparent threshold of 20 NTU, there were less than five species of submergent plants, while a more diverse community existed in less turbid systems. We predict that water turbidity in Cootes Paradise Marsh may not be reduced below this threshold value of 20 NTU following carp exclusion. We emphasize the need to consider other factors that may contribute to increases in water turbidity and nutrient concentrations, including wind resuspension and substrate characteristics.},

The effect of such a loss on the usual estimate of population size and the estimate of its variance is investigated for both single and double tagging. When there is double tagging, a correction for tag loss can be made based on the numbers recaptured that retain one or both tags, provided we can assume independence of the tags. Two cases are considered, distinguishable tags and nondistinguishable tags in which the latter have the same loss rates; new approximately unbiased estimates of population size and their variance estimates are introduced. It is shown that these estimates are moderately robust to dependence between the two tags and that there is little to be gained by using nondistinguishable tags. © 1981 Biometrika Trust.},

This paper compares four such strategies, namely, 'random', 'regular', 'proportional-stratified' and 'equal-stratified'-to investigate (1) how they affect prediction accuracy and (2) how sensitive they are to sample size. In order to compare them, a virtual species approach (Ecol. Model. 145 (2001) 111) in a real landscape, based on reliable data, was chosen. The distribution of the virtual species was sampled 300 times using each of the four strategies in four sample sizes. The sampled data were then fed into a GLM to make two types of prediction: (1) habitat suitability and (2) presence/absence. Comparing the predictions to the known distribution of the virtual species allows model accuracy to be assessed. Habitat suitability predictions were assessed by Pearson's correlation coefficient and presence/absence predictions by Cohen's κ agreement coefficient. The results show the 'regular' and 'equal-stratified' sampling strategies to be the most accurate and most robust. We propose the following characteristics to improve sample design: (1) increase sample size, (2) prefer systematic to random sampling and (3) include environmental information in the design. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

These estimates were compared to measurements obtained from subsequent destructive sampling of reefs (98.5 \% of fish collected from all reefs). An increase in census period does not continue to improve the accuracy of the estimates of numbers of fish. The accuracy of the 10 min census did not differ significantly from the 15 min census, although it was significantly higher than the 5 min census. Also, observers had unique biases for specific size-classes when estimating the size structure of the population. Biomass was estimated from the visual censuses of one observer, using a length-weight relationship, and compared to a known biomass from subsequent destructive collections. The mean accuracy of the biomass estimate derived from visual estimates of lengths was 72.3 \%. This level of accuracy was obtained when the length-weight relationship was good (r² = 0.97) and the estimates of lengths of each size-class (mean accuracy = 86 \%, pooled for observer, times and sites) and the estimate of numbers (mean accuracy = 91.6 \% for the 10 min census) both had high levels of accuracy. But such high accuracies may not be expected for censuses of larger mobile species. The use of visual censuses to estimate the biomass of such fish populations are likely to be subject to greater inaccuracy. Most of the error in the visual estimates of biomass was explained by the inaccuracies of estimating the length of fish visually. Categorising fish into 5 mm size-classes or using a length-weight relationship to convert length to biomass did not significantly affect the accuracy of the estimates.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In this paper was presented the problems of methane leakages during cargo operations on LNG carriers. Also the leakages are possible on LNG fueled vessels. Due to green-house effect from methane on the atmosphere it should be done some measures to avoid it. Building the cargo tanks with very high capacity, utilization of better thermal insulations limits the quantity of boil-off (BOG). It is used as a fuel in marine power plant, only the overage should be liquefied again. The leakages attend all cargo operations which methane goes directly to the atmosphere through pressure-vacuum valves and gas freeing installation to mast riser or by the ventilation system from cargo pump or compressor room. To minimize the slip on LNG carriers the re-liquefaction systems are installed. They are based on cooling systems which boil-off gas (mainly methane) is liquefied at ambient pressure in temperature about −161.5°C by pre-cooled nitrogen gas at temperature about −180°C. Compressed nitrogen to a pressure about 25MPa through multistage compressors with intercooling systems is expanded step by step (in intercoolers) to pressure about ambient reaches the temperature about −180°C. The re-liquefaction system needs delivering a lot of electric energy. The total level of methane leakages from mining to the last consumer may be different and sometimes very high. The leakage level starts as minimal 1\% and may be raised up to 10\%. It was indicated the undertaken actions and next possibilities of methane slip limitations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The proportion of mature worms in the seals’ stomachs has decreased, however. Seal growth, expressed in terms of either age orlength, showed the strongest correlation with total worm abundance. These infections were not completely eliminated at any time during the year, but a seasonal pattern in worm abundance was apparent. Among the youngest seals an inverse relationship was demonstrated between the abundance of P. decipiens and another parasitic nematode, Contracaecum osculatum. Sexually mature P. decipiens were found in pups within 3 to 4 months of the commencement of independent feeding, and the abundance of P. decipiens progressively increased throughout the first year of life. Male pups contracted more worms than female pups of the same age. P. decipiens abundances in juvenile seals were primarily associated with seasonal pattern and age, with C. osculatum abundance still influencing the abundance of P. decipiens, but to a much lesser extent than seen with pups. Length of seals was the main predictor of total worm abundance in adult seals, with a seasonal pattern being next in order of importance. Age was also significant, possibly representing a component of growth not accounted for by length alone. No relationship between the abundances of P. decipiens and C. osculatum was apparent for adult seals. The seasonal pattern in total worm abundance of juvenile and adult seals was characterized by declines during the winter and mid-summer. We suggest these declines are due, respectively, to the breeding season fast and one or both of 1) a change in seal diet from primarily highly infected fish species to less infected ones, and 2) a partial fast during the annual moult. The proportion of mature worms increased during reductions in worm abundance throughout most of the year, but during the breeding fast both total abundance and the proportionmature declined.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We analysed a depleted stock to the West of Scotland and show that seal predation rate is consistent with a type II functional response. Forward projections of a model including the functional response under varying levels of fishing and seal population size suggest that stock recovery is possible under current conditions, but there is a modest probability that the stock will decline further in both the short and long term. The potential recovery is fragile and sensitive to relatively small increases in either fishing or seal predation. Forward projection models that exclude the functional response estimate a lower probability of stock decline and may underestimate the risk to the stock. At low stock sizes and high fishing mortality rates, functional response models project slower recovery but the opposite is true at low fishing mortality.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {In light of the negative effects of historical and contemporary colonialism on the Labrador Innu, healing initiatives grounded in self-determination, renewal of cultural practices, and non-reliance on Western bio-medicine, are known, taught and widely practiced among the Innu. The value of Indigenous healing practices in the treatment of Indigenous people is well-recognized in Indigenous wellness literature, yet non-Indigenous health practitioners know little about healing processes. Moreover, to our knowledge, no studies have examined any contemporary Labrador Innu healing process. The main aim of this paper is to describe the process of healing among the Innu. Although there may be multiple processes of healing, we shed light on a major process that emerged from interviews and focus groups with 39 participants. Five stages of healing were described: being “under the blanket”; finding spiritual strength; extending hands out; finding strength and power; and helping others. Findings highlighted enablement of healing through spiritualities, support from Elders, return to culture, and resistance to negative stereotypes. We provide health professionals with valuable information for considering Innu healing as a model that expands their views for the benefit of Innu seeking mental health services. Implications for non-Innu health and social service providers are about broadening their understanding of the significant role of self-determination among Innu, learning Innu ways-of-knowing and being, recognizing one's own biases, and acknowledging the power imbalances between themselves and Innu people.},

Locally, the Meewasin Valley Authority (MVA) is actively controlling buckthorn as part of its mandate to conserve natural heritage resources of the South Saskatchewan River Valley, with the goal of restoring the natural biodiversity of remnant patches of native vegetation. European buckthorn is normally dioecious, and MVA has chosen to treat only fruiting stems in an attempt to limit seed production. Two control techniques have been used. In one treatment, glyphosate was applied to stems after cutting; alternatively Garlon 4 Dow AgroSciences herbicide (active ingredient triclopyr) was applied as a chemical girdle directly to the stems using a streamline basal bark spray method. To date, more than 347,000 fruiting stems of buckthorn have been treated. Results indicate good initial progress in limiting seed production in dense buckthorn sites, but at a high cost. Although seed eradication is not a practical short-term goal for the Saskatoon buckthorn population, chemical girdling can substantially and strategically reduce seed and effectively limit spread. Field-tested strategies to reduce costs and improve efficiencies are discussed.},

	abstract = {Summary This study examined an ‘invasional meltdown’, where the invasion of a Midwestern woodland by an exotic shrub (Rhamnus cathartica L.P. Mill) and the invasion by Eurasian earthworms facilitated one another. Using a litterbag approach, we examined mass loss of four substrates (R. cathartica, Acer saccharum, Quercus rubra, and Quercus alba) along a gradient of Eurasian earthworm density and biomass throughout a 40.5ha oak woodland in Glencoe, Illinois. Earthworm densities and biomass were greatest in patches where R. cathartica prevailed, and populations were lowest in an upland forest subcommunity within the woodland. At each of three points along this earthworm gradient, we placed replicated litterbags constructed either to permit or to deny access to the litter by earthworms. The treatments were, therefore, plot treatments (low, medium and high earthworm density and biomass) and litterbag treatments (earthworm access and earthworm excluded). We found that earthworms promoted a very rapid loss of litter from R. cathartica bags. Within 3 months greater than 90\% of this litter was lost from the litterbags. Earthworm impacts on other substrates followed the sequence A. saccharum{\textgreater}Q. alba=Q. rubra. Effects of both litterbag and plot treatments were found within 3 months for A. saccharum but Quercus species were affected only after a year. We propose that the impact of earthworms on litter breakdown creates conditions that promote and sustain invasion by R. cathartica. Previous work has demonstrated that R. cathartica may alter soil properties in a way that promotes and sustains invasion by earthworms. These findings have implications for the restoration management of these systems, since the legacy of R. cathartica on soil properties and earthworm populations may persist even after the plant has been physically removed.},

	abstract = {Recent studies document North American earthworm invasions and their profound effects on the structure of the soil profile, which is the habitat for soil microorganisms (mainly fungi and bacteria). Dramatic alterations made to these layers during earthworm invasion significantly change microbial community structure and therefore microbial activities such as C transformations. Understanding the impacts of earthworm invasion on the microbes themselves will give insight into earthworm effects on microbial activities. Bacterial and actinomycete communities in earthworm guts and casts have not been studied in environments recently invaded by earthworms. Earthworm invasion tended to decrease fungal species density and fungal species diversity and richness. The presence of earthworms decreased zygomycete species abundance probably due to disruption of fungal hyphae. Physical disruption of hyphae may also explain decreased mycorrhizal colonization rates, decreased mycorrhizal abundance and altered mycorrhizal morphology in the presence of earthworms. Mixing of organic layers into mineral soil during earthworm invasion tended to decrease microbial biomass in forest floor materials while increasing it in mineral soil. In newly invaded forest soils, microbial respiration and the metabolic quotient tended to decline. In forests where either the microbial community has had time to adapt to earthworm activities, or where the destruction of the forest floor is complete, as in invasions by the Asian Amynthas hawayanus, the presence of earthworms tends to increase the metabolic quotient indicating a shift to a smaller, more active microbial community.},

	abstract = {[Line transect sampling is used to estimate the number of individuals in a study area. It is usually assumed that the detections of individuals constitute independent events, and that the probability of detecting an item is a function of its perpendicular distance from the transect. However, certain species of plants/animals tend to aggregate, or cluster, thus possibly violating the assumption of independence. Also, larger clusters may tend to have a higher probability of detection, thus distorting the observed probability distribution of cluster sizes. This can cause overestimation of the true population size. A similar problem occurs if the experimenter is using line transect data to estimate the mean and total amount of some attribute of the items, and this attribute influences the item's probability of detection. Bivariate detection functions that incorporate the cluster size, or another attribute, as a covariate are proposed. Estimators of total population size and of the moments of the additional variate are derived using the theory of weighted distributions. An application of the method to a shipboard survey of minke whales is provided.]},

	abstract = {Biological invasions and changes in land-use are two components of global change affecting biodiversity worldwide. There is overriding evidence that invasions can dramatically change the landscape and that particular land-use types facilitate invasions. Still, these issues have not formally percolated into risk analysis of biological invasions, and only recently has the influence of the surrounding landscape on invasive species spread started to be considered. In this paper we review the literature on the influence of the surrounding landscape on the local level of plant invasions (i.e., abundance and richness of alien plants in plant communities). Our review confirms that there are more alien plant species and they are more abundant at fragment edges than in the interior of fragments. The decline on the level of invasion towards the interior of fragments is sharp. To a lesser extent, there is higher invasion in small isolated fragments than in large connected patches. However, despite their relevance, the influence of connectivity and shape of the fragments have been scarcely explored. Besides the fact that a site has more invaders if surrounded by a human-dominated landscape than by a natural one, the past history and the configuration of that landscape are also important. Invasion within land-uses is often associated with the historical legacy of changes in land-use, indicating that current land-uses might represent an invasion credit to future invasions. Accurate accounts of the invasion process and effective conservation programs will depend on such considerations.},

	abstract = {Common buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica L.) is one of the most abundant and ecologically harmful non-native plants in forests of the Upper Midwest United States. At the same time, European earthworms are invading previously glaciated areas in this region, with largely anecdotal evidence suggesting they compound the negative effects of buckthorn and influence the invasibility of these forests. Germination and seedling establishment are important control points for colonization by any species, and manipulation of the conditions influencing these life history stages may provide insight into why invasive species are successful in some environments and not others. Using a greenhouse microcosm experiment, we examined the effects of important biotic and abiotic factors on the germination and seedling establishment of common buckthorn. We manipulated light levels, leaf litter depth and earthworm presence to investigate the independent and interactive effects of these treatments on buckthorn establishment. We found that light and leaf litter depth were significant predictors of buckthorn germination but that the presence of earthworms was the most important factor; earthworms interacted with light and leaf litter to increase the number and biomass of buckthorn across all treatments. Path analysis suggested both direct and moisture-mediated indirect mechanisms controlled these processes. The results suggest that the action of earthworms may provide a pathway through which buckthorn invades forests of the Upper Midwest United States. Hence, researchers and managers should consider co-invasion of plants and earthworms when investigating invasibility and creating preemptive or post-invasion management plans.},

To assess the community-level consequences of this invasion, we compared understory composition, richness, and structure beneath canopies of invasive Acer platanoides and of native Acer saccharum and Fagus grandifolia. Understory species richness was significantly lower beneath Acer platanoides and highest beneath Fagus grandifolia. Stem densities were high beneath Acer platanoides but consisted primarily of its own seedlings and saplings. When these Acer platanoides stems were removed from the analysis, there was a trend toward lower stem densities beneath the exotic tree compared with the native canopies. Individual shrub and forb species were too patchy for any canopy affinities to demonstrate significance within this small forest preserve, with two exceptions: Epifagus virginiana, a beech (Fagus) root parasite, was less abundant under Acer platanoides than under either Fagus grandifolia or Acer saccharum; and the shrub Lindera benzoin was less abundant under Acer platanoides and Fagus grandifolia than under Acer saccharum. Among tree seedlings, the exotic Acer platanoides far outnumbered all others, beneath its own canopy and also beneath the two native trees. A surprising paucity of Fagus grandifolia reproduction seems unrelated to the biological invasion.

The invasion of European earthworms into previously earthworm-free temperate and boreal forests of North America dominated by Acer, Quercus, Betula, Pinus and Populus has provided ample opportunity to observe how earthworms engineer ecosystems. Impacts vary with soil parent material, land use history, and assemblage of invading earthworm species. Earthworms reduce the thickness of organic layers, increase the bulk density of soils and incorporate litter and humus materials into deeper horizons of the soil profile, thereby affecting the whole soil food web and the above ground plant community. Mixing of organic and mineral materials turns mor into mull humus which significantly changes the distribution and community composition of the soil microflora and seedbed conditions for vascular plants. In some forests earthworm invasion leads to reduced availability and increased leaching of N and P in soil horizons where most fine roots are concentrated. Earthworms can contribute to a forest decline syndrome, and forest herbs in the genera Aralia, Botrychium, Osmorhiza, Trillium, Uvularia, and Viola are reduced in abundance during earthworm invasion. The degree of plant recovery after invasion varies greatly among sites and depends on complex interactions with soil processes and herbivores. These changes are likely to alter competitive relationships among plant species, possibly facilitating invasion of exotic plant species such as Rhamnus cathartica into North American forests, leading to as yet unknown changes in successional trajectory.},

The mean total densities of seedlings of 18 fleshy-fruited species differed under the different ‘hosts’, being highest under Crataegus monogyna, Viburnum opulus and Rosa canina (24–20 m−2); intermediate under Sorbus aria, Rhamnus catharticus, Cornus sanguinea, Ligustrum vulgare and Juniperus communis (17–12 m−2); and lowest under Euonymus europaeus, Viburnum lantana and Prunus spinosa (10–9 m−2). This ranking was similar for the 11 planted species and for nine bird-dispersed, non-planted species which invaded the site, notably Hedera helix and Solanum dulcamara. Within the experimental scrub as a whole mortality of seedlings differed significantly among species, being highest in those with the smallest number of recruits. Mortality ranged from 94\% and 89\% for Solanum dulcamara and Viburnum opulus to 26\% for Hedera helix and Ligustrum vulgare. The mean mortality across all species of seedlings did not differ significantly between host species, although it was slightly higher under Juniperus and Cornus (56\%, 53\%) and lower under Viburnum lantana and Rhamnus (42\%, 41\%). In four species, the mortality of seedlings was significantly higher under conspecific adults. Mean topsoil water content after a dry spell was negatively correlated with the diffuse site factor (DSF). The mean density of accumulated seedlings of the most abundant seedling species (Hedera) was positively correlated with the topsoil water content. Densities of other species showed no strong correlations with either topsoil water content or DSF. The probable factors controlling recruitment are discussed.},

	abstract = {[European earthworms are invading previously worm-free hardwood forests across Minnesota and the Great Lakes region. In many of these forests, earthworm invasions have been associated with the loss of a previously thick forest floor. The ability of earthworms to alter and control ecosystem processes has been demonstrated in agricultural systems, but the dynamics and impact of these invasions in native forest ecosystems is largely unknown. The impacts of earthworm invasion are expected to be related to the size and species composition of the earthworm population because different species have different habitat and feeding preferences. We identified four sugar maple dominated forests in north central Minnesota in the Chippewa National Forest with active earthworm invasion. In each site a sample grid of 45 points (30 x 150 m) 10 m apart in three parallel transects with 15 points each was established that spanned a visible leading edge of invasion. Over four years earthworm populations and forest floor thickness were sampled across all transects, thus providing both a space-for-time assessment of decadal scale successional dynamics and a four-year window into shorter time changes. We found a succession of earthworm species across the visible leading edge due to different patterns of colonization by different earthworm species. Marked increases in space and time in earthworm biomass were associated with the development of discrete transition zones where forest floor thickness decreases to zero in as little as 75 m from areas that have forest floor layers up to 10 cm thick with advancement of the visible leading edge of up to 30 m in four years at three of the study sites. The epi-endogeic species Lumbricus rubellus led to the most rapid removal of forest floor material during initial invasion. Epigeic and epi-endogeic species of earthworms may facilitate the establishment of other species of earthworms leading to the establishment of stable populations of endogeic and anecic species, which prevent recovery of the forest floor.]},

We examined the relationships between resource availability and leaf photosynthetic performance in these four species. All four species had similar relationships between leaf nitrogen (N) content and photosynthetic rate, but the species differed in absolute leaf N content and therefore in photosynthetic rates. Maximum daily photosynthetic rates of all species were significantly correlated with leaf N content in the open habitat, but not in the understory, where low light availability was the major limitation to photosynthesis. Extended leaf longevity was important in the forest understory because it allowed shrubs to take advantage of high light availability at times when the overstory canopy was leafless. Early leaf emergence was more important than late senescence: from 27\% to 35\% of the annual carbon gain of P. serotina, R. cathartica, and L. X bella occurred prior to leaf emergence of C. racemosa, the species with the shortest leaf life span. Extended leaf longevity of exotic shrubs may help explain their persistence in the understory habitat, but it contributed relatively less to their annual carbon gain in the open habitat.},

We measured the distribution and activity of microbial biomass in forest stands invaded by earthworms and in adjacent stands lacking earthworms in sugar maple-dominated forests in two locations in New York State, USA: one with a history of cultivation and thin organic surface soil horizons (forest floors) and the other with no history of cultivation and a thick (3-5 cm) forest floor. Earthworm invasion greatly reduced pools of microbial biomass in the forest floor and increased pools in the mineral soil. Enrichment of the mineral soil was much more marked at the site with thick forest floors. The increase in microbial biomass carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in the mineral soil at this site was larger than the decrease in the forest floor, resulting in a net increase in total soil profile microbial biomass in the invaded plots. There was an increase in respiration in the mineral soil at both sites, which is consistent with a movement of organic matter and microbial biomass into the mineral soil. However, N-cycle processes (mineralization and nitrification) did not increase along with respiration. It is likely that the earthworm-induced input of C into the mineral soil created a microbial "sink" for N, preventing an increase in net mineralization and nitrification and conserving N in the soil profile.]},

Our objectives were to assess the influence of exotic earthworm invasion on (a) the amount and depth distribution of soil C and N, (b) soil δ 13 C and δ 15 N, and (c) soil solution chemistry and leaching of C and N in forests with different land-use histories. At a relatively undisturbed forest site (Arnot Forest), earthworms eliminated the thick forest floor, decreased soil C storage in the upper 12 cm by 28\%, and reduced soil C:N ratios from 19.2 to 15.3. At a previously cultivated forest site with little forest floor (Tompkins Farm), earthworms did not influence the storage of soil C or N or soil C:N ratios. Earthworms altered the stable isotopic signature of soil at Arnot Forest but not at Tompkins Farm; the alteration of stable isotopes indicated that earthworms significantly increased the loss of forest floor C but not N from the soil profile at Arnot Forest. Nitrate \$(\{{\textbackslash}rm NO\}\_\{3\}\{\}{\textasciicircum}\{-\})\$ concentrations in tension and zero-tension lysimeters were much greater at Tompkins Farm than Arnot Forest, and earthworms increased NO3 - leaching at Tompkins Farm. The results suggest that the effect of earthworm invasion on the distribution, retention, and solution chemistry of soil C and N in northern temperate forests may depend on the initial quantity and quality of soil organic matter at invaded sites.]},

We performed an architectural analysis to gain an understanding of the structural and ontogenic properties of common buckthorn ( Rhamnus cathartica L., Rhamnaceae) growing in the understory and under an open canopy. We found that ontogenic effects on growth need to be calibrated if a full description of phenotypic plasticity is to be obtained. Our analysis pointed to three levels of organization (or nested structural units) in R. cathartica. Their modulation in relation to light conditions leads to the expression of two architectural strategies that involve sets of traits known to confer competitive advantage in their respective environments. In the understory, the plant develops a tree-like form. Its strategy here is based on restricting investment in exploitation structures while promoting major vertical exploration and is probably key to species survival in the understory. Under an open canopy, the second strategy leads the plant to adopt a shrub-like shape. It develops densely branched exploitation structures and flowers abundantly and rapidly. This strategy perfectly matches its aggressive behaviour observed in full sunlight. We propose, as hypotheses, that these two light-related strategies are implicated in the ability of R. cathartica to outcompete the surrounding vegetation in a range of environmental conditions.},

	abstract = {The productivity of aquatic ecosystems depends on the supply of limiting nutrients. The invasion of the Laurentian Great Lakes, the world’s largest freshwater ecosystem, by dreissenid (zebra and quagga) mussels has dramatically altered the ecology of these lakes. A key open question is how dreissenids affect the cycling of phosphorus (P), the nutrient that limits productivity in the Great Lakes. We show that a single species, the quagga mussel, is now the primary regulator of P cycling in the lower four Great Lakes. By virtue of their enormous biomass, quagga mussels sequester large quantities of P in their tissues and dramatically intensify benthic P exchanges. Mass balance analysis reveals a previously unrecognized sensitivity of the Great Lakes ecosystem, where P availability is now regulated by the dynamics of mussel populations while the role of the external inputs of phosphorus is suppressed. Our results show that a single invasive species can have dramatic consequences for geochemical cycles even in the world’s largest aquatic ecosystems. The ongoing spread of dreissenids across a multitude of lakes in North America and Europe is likely to affect carbon and nutrient cycling in these systems for many decades, with important implications for water quality management.},

	abstract = {Dreissenid mussels have been exceptionally successful invaders in North American lakes and rivers, especially in the lower Laurentian Great Lakes. As benthic filter feeders capable of attaching to hard substrates, the magnitudes of their biomass and filtering activity in nearshore waters are without precedent. The dreissenid colonization has implications for the removal and fate of materials filtered from the water by the mussels and for the longer-term development of the nearshore benthic community and lake ecosystem. A conceptual model, the nearshore shunt, seeks to describe a fundamental redirection of nutrient and energy flow consequent to dreissenid establishment. The model explains some emergent problems in the Great Lakes, such as reemergence of Cladophora in some coastal zones while offshore P concentrations remain low, and highlights areas in need of more research. The source of particulate nutrient inputs to dreissenids and the fate of materials exported from the benthic community are critical to understanding the role of dreissenids in the lakes and assessing the applicability of current models for managing nutrients and fisheries. The nearshore shunt would require even more stringent P management for lakes strongly impacted by dreissenids to maintain nearshore water quality.},

	abstract = {Lakes and reservoirs play key roles in global carbon cycling, especially as a carbon sink. Enrichment of nutrients in lakes and reservoirs (eutrophication) and rising global temperatures favors the proliferation of bloom-forming cyanobacteria. Harmful blooms of cyanobacteria (cyanoHABs) alter carbon and nutrient cycling in freshwater ecosystems. Some evidence suggests the introduction or establishment of invasive mussel species (i.e., Dreissena spp.) also favor cyanoHAB formation through selective filter feeding, a process through which they may also impact biogeochemical processes including carbon cycling and sequestration. However, few studies have considered the combined effects of invasive mussels and cyanoHABs on carbon and nitrogen cycling in freshwater ecosystems. Here, we examined microbial community composition and biogeochemical attributes (including carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes) in eutrophic lakes, reservoirs, and rivers in western Ohio, eastern Indiana, and northern Kentucky during the cyanobacterial bloom period of the summer of 2015. Our samples include both sites impacted by invasive mussels and those where invasive mussels have not yet been observed. Based on 16S and 18S rRNA gene sequence analysis, we found that cyanobacterial and algal communities varied across sites and were most closely related to habitat (sediment or water column sample) and site, regardless of the presence of invasive mussels or other environmental factors. However, we did find evidence that invasive mussels may influence both carbon and nitrogen cycling. While the results are based on a single time point sampling, they highlight the interactions of multiple environmental stressors in aquatic ecosystems and the critical need for more temporally intensive studies of carbon and nutrient cycling in bloom- and mussel-impacted waters.},

Length–frequency analyses of populations from the Great Lakes and review of historical benthic studies suggest that the mussel was introduced into Lake St. Clair in late 1986, probably as a result of the discharge of ballast water from an ocean-crossing vessel. Following the 1990 reproductive season, Dreissena populations ranged from the head of the St. Clair River, through Lake St. Clair, the Detroit River, Lake Erie, the Welland Canal, and the Niagara River to the western basin and southern shoreline of Lake Ontario. Isolated populations were found in the St. Lawrence River and in harbours in Lakes Huron, Michigan, and Superior. The rapid dispersal of this organism has resulted from its high fecundity, pelagic larval stage, bysso-pelagic drifting ability of juveniles, and human activities associated with commercial shipping, fishing, and boating (research and pleasure). Virtually any waterbody that can be reached by boaters and fisherman within a few days travel of the lower Great Lakes, particularly Lake Erie, seems to be at risk of being invaded by this nuisance species.},

There was a significant edge effect, although different variables contributed differently to the pattern. The reedbed edge had three bands: the first is characterised by very dense stand, where the shoots were thin and short; in the second band density declined, but reed shoots were thick and very high, and in the third band both density and height declined, but not shoot diameter. Microclimate variables showed similar pattern: reedbed edges were warm, dry, bright and windy, further inside temperature, light and wind intensity declined, humidity increased, and still further temperature and light intensity increased, and humidity decreased. I estimated that the edge effect penetrates into the reedbed up to ca. 15 m. The great variation of variables across the edge inevitable has significant impact on the occurrence of animals species; our knowledge, however, is too limited to predict the expected extinction of species owing to edge effect.},

Differences in chemical and physical soil properties were found between road verges and adjacent native vegetation areas. Soils from natural areas had higher humus levels, less gravel and sand, higher levels of nutrients, and higher pH and electrical conductivity than road verges. A relationship was found between soil properties and the occurrence of different exotic plant species along roadsides. Exotics dominated in areas along the road verge and road drainage lines. The dominant exotic found in these ecotypes was Achillea millefolium (yarrow). These ecotypes were characterized by high water and sediment wash off, which had significantly higher soil pH and exchangeable levels of calcium and potassium than natural areas and disturbed areas without yarrow.},

	abstract = {The growth of pure populations of the beetles Rhizopertha dominica and Oryzaephilus surinamensis , and of the moth Sitotroga cerealella , was observed in a standard medium of wheat. This was maintained at a constant level by the periodic removal of ‘conditioned’ frass and the addition of fresh grains. The population of each species rose to a maximum and remained fluctuating about this value indefinitely. A comparison of the rates of oviposition, with the rates at which adults emerged, showed that in the maximum population there was an enormous mortality (always over 90\%) in the immature stages. When pairs of species competed Rhizopertha eliminated Sitotroga because their larvae, between which most of the competition occurred, have the same needs and habits. But each of these species was able to survive with Oryzaephilus because this species occupies a different ‘ecological niche’. The Verhulst-Pearl ‘logistic’ equation (1), for the growth of population of a single species in a limited environment, and the Lotka-Volterra simultaneous equations (2), for the growth of population of two species competing for the same limited environment, were fitted to the census data from all the experiments. The biological assumptions on which they are based proved to be true for practical purposes for Rhizopertha and Sitotroga populations. These assumptions are that the value of the potential rate of increase remains statistically constant and that all the factors inhibiting increase are linearly related to population density. Further­ more, a single factor, larval competition, was represented by the single indices standing for interspecific inhibition. It follows that the maximum population (or equilibrium position) should be independent of the initial population, and this proved to be so for all species. Equations (2) did not always fit the observed points very well, but they were always success­ful in predicting the outcome of competition. It does not follow from this that these equa­tions have any general validity. Their basic assumptions are by no means universally true and, unless they are shown to be so for a particular species under known, environmental conditions, no biological deductions can be drawn from them. Where they do apply they describe the course of change of population of two competing organisms with an accuracy which depends on the constancy of the coefficients involved. Two kinds of organism will be able to survive together only if they differ in needs and habits, i. e. occupy different ecological niches. Populations living in a medium of unrenewed wheat rose to a maximum and then declined as the food became exhausted and ‘conditioning’ increased. The eventual extinction of the population was due, not to the cessation of oviposition, but to the failure of the larvae to survive. The longevity of Rhizopertha adults was lower in unrenewed than in renewed medium, and lower still when this species was competing with Sitotroga in unrenewed medium. The longevity of the other species, and the sex ratio of Sitotroga , were apparently unaffected by these conditions. The fecundity of Rhizopertha females decreased with time, and the length of Sitotroga adults of both sexes decreased in succeeding generations. The competitive relation­ship between both Sitotroga and Rhizopertha , and Oryzaephilus shifted slightly in favour of the former species in unrenewed as compared with renewed media. In a renewed medium this relationship probably depends chiefly on the destruction of eggs and pupae by adults and larvae, for which the more predaceous Oryzaephilus is better placed. In an unrenewed medium the ability of the larvae to make the best use of the limited food supply is the determining factor, and here the other two species have the advantage. The competitive relationship between Rhizopertha and Sitotroga remained the same in both media.},

Zostera marina, the native eelgrass, grows in the mid to low intertidal regions and is a K-strategist; i.e., a perennial that uses a large proportion of its resources for maintenance via rhizomes and roots.

	abstract = {Understanding why females of some mammalian species cease ovulation prior to the end of life is a long-standing interdisciplinary and evolutionary challenge. In humans and some species of toothed whales, females can live for decades after stopping reproduction. This unusual life history trait is thought to have evolved, in part, due to the inclusive fitness benefits that postreproductive females gain by helping kin. In humans, grandmothers gain inclusive fitness benefits by increasing their number of surviving grandoffspring, referred to as the grandmother effect. Among toothed whales, the grandmother effect has not been rigorously tested. Here, we test for the grandmother effect in killer whales, by quantifying grandoffspring survival with living or recently deceased reproductive and postreproductive grandmothers, and show that postreproductive grandmothers provide significant survival benefits to their grandoffspring above that provided by reproductive grandmothers. This provides evidence of the grandmother effect in a nonhuman menopausal species. By stopping reproduction, grandmothers avoid reproductive conflict with their daughters, and offer increased benefits to their grandoffspring. The benefits postreproductive grandmothers provide to their grandoffspring are shown to be most important in difficult times where the salmon abundance is low to moderate. The postreproductive grandmother effect we report, together with the known costs of late-life reproduction in killer whales, can help explain the long postreproductive life spans of resident killer whales.},

Complete reproductive cessation and a long post-reproductive female lifespan as found in humans are also found in killer whale ( Orcinus orca ) and short-finned pilot whale ( Globicephala macrorhynchus ), but not in the long-finned pilot whale ( Globicephala melaena ). Each species forms kin-based, stable matrilineal groups and exhibits kin-directed behaviours that could increase inclusive fitness. Here, the initial mortality rate and mortality rate-doubling time of females of these three closely related whale species are compared. The initial mortality rate shows little variation among pilot whale species; however mortality rate accelerates almost twice as fast in the long-finned pilot whale as it does in killer whale and short-finned pilot whale.

	abstract = {Killer whales ( Orcinus orca ) are large predators that occupy the top trophic position in the world's oceans and as such may have important roles in marine ecosystem dynamics. Although the possible top-down effects of killer whale predation on populations of their prey have received much recent attention, little is known of how the abundance of these predators may be limited by bottom-up processes. Here we show, using 25 years of demographic data from two populations of fish-eating killer whales in the northeastern Pacific Ocean, that population trends are driven largely by changes in survival, and that survival rates are strongly correlated with the availability of their principal prey species, Chinook salmon ( Oncorhynchus tshawytscha ). Our results suggest that, although these killer whales may consume a variety of fish species, they are highly specialized and dependent on this single salmonid species to an extent that it is a limiting factor in their population dynamics. Other ecologically specialized killer whale populations may be similarly constrained to a narrow range of prey species by culturally inherited foraging strategies, and thus are limited in their ability to adapt rapidly to changing prey availability.},

	abstract = {Understanding why females of some mammalian species cease ovulation prior to the end of life is a long-standing interdisciplinary and evolutionary challenge. In humans and some species of toothed whales, females can live for decades after stopping reproduction. This unusual life history trait is thought to have evolved, in part, due to the inclusive fitness benefits that postreproductive females gain by helping kin. In humans, grandmothers gain inclusive fitness benefits by increasing their number of surviving grandoffspring, referred to as the grandmother effect. Among toothed whales, the grandmother effect has not been rigorously tested. Here, we test for the grandmother effect in killer whales, by quantifying grandoffspring survival with living or recently deceased reproductive and postreproductive grandmothers, and show that postreproductive grandmothers provide significant survival benefits to their grandoffspring above that provided by reproductive grandmothers. This provides evidence of the grandmother effect in a nonhuman menopausal species. By stopping reproduction, grandmothers avoid reproductive conflict with their daughters, and offer increased benefits to their grandoffspring. The benefits postreproductive grandmothers provide to their grandoffspring are shown to be most important in difficult times where the salmon abundance is low to moderate. The postreproductive grandmother effect we report, together with the known costs of late-life reproduction in killer whales, can help explain the long postreproductive life spans of resident killer whales.},

Each species forms kin-based, stable matrilineal groups and exhibits kin-directed behaviours that could increase inclusive fitness. Here, the initial mortality rate and mortality rate-doubling time of females of these three closely related whale species are compared. The initial mortality rate shows little variation among pilot whale species; however mortality rate accelerates almost twice as fast in the long-finned pilot whale as it does in killer whale and short-finned pilot whale.

	abstract = {This study tests hypotheses on the biochemical functions of geophagy in parrots: mechanical enhancement of digestion, acid buffering capacity, mineral supplementation, adsorption of dietary toxins, and gastrointestinal cytoprotection. Parrots showed clear preferences for specific soil horizons. Comparisons of preferred and nonpreferred soils from several sites suggest that soils have little ability to enhance grinding and no measurable ability to buffer gastric pH. Soils offered insignificant mineral supplementation since most minerals occurred at similar levels in samples regardless of preference, and the minerals were generally more plentiful in the birds' diets. Sodium was available in moderate levels at some sites ({\textgreater}1000 ppm), but was well below sodium detection thresholds of parrots. X-ray diffraction, cation exchange capacity, and in vitro adsorptive trials showed that the preferred soils are capable of exchanging substantial quantities of cations and are capable of adsorbing low-molecular-weight secondary compounds. In captive Amazona parrots, orally administered clay reduced the bioavailability of the alkaloid quinidine by roughly 60\%, demonstrating that in vivo adsorption of potentially toxic compounds may be a biologically important function of geophagy. Labeled clay remained in the lower gastrointestinal tract of captive parrots for {\textgreater}12 hr, which along with high adsorptive capacities, further suggests a potential role in protecting the gastrointestinal lining from various biological and chemical insults. Detoxification and cytoprotection are the most likely functions of geophagy for parrots and herbivores with similar ecologies. Given the variety of chemically defended seeds consumed by these herbivores, geophagy likely protects consumers from dietary toxins, allowing increased diet breadth and/or enhancing digestibility.},

Seven hypotheses have been suggested for the origin of attine fungiculture, each differing with respect to the substrate used by the ancestral attine ants for fungal cultivation. Phylogenetic information on the cultivated fungi, in conjunction with information on the nesting biology of extant attine ants and their presumed closest relatives, reveal that the attine ancestors probably did not encounter their cultivars-to-be in seed stores (von Ihering 1894), in rotting wood (Forel 1902), as mycorrhizae (Garling 1979), on arthropod corpses (von Ihering 1894) or ant faeces in nest middens (Wheeler 1907). Rather, the attine ant-fungus mutualism probably arose from adventitious interactions with fungi that grew on walls of nests built in leaf litter (Emery 1899), or from a system of fungal myrmecochory in which specialized fungi relied on ants for dispersal (Bailey 1920) and in which the ants fortuitously vectored these fungi from parent to offspring nests prior to a true fungicultural stage.},

A triangular model based upon the three strategies may be reconciled with the theory of r- and K-selection, provides an insight into the processes of vegetation succession and dominance, and appears to be capable of extension to fungi and to animals.},

	abstract = {The impacts of forest management on habitat characteristics, species richness, and population dynamics of small mammals remain ambiguous. We studied the response of small-mammal populations, including snowshoe hares, to clear-cutting with protection of advanced regeneration and soils (CPRS) and precommercial thinning (PCT). We compared stands recently treated by CPRS or PCT with established stands dominated by deciduous or coniferous trees in two large blocks of mixed forests. We measured habitat components and abundance of small mammals in the four stand types. Trees (DBH ≥ 9 cm) became very rare in CPRS stands and remained at low density in PCT stands, which stimulated the growth of herbs and seedlings, resulting in increased lateral cover. Tree harvest also generated coarse woody debris in CPRS stands, which did not persist in PCT stands. Small mammals responded to these disturbances in a species-specific manner but, overall, relative abundance and species richness of small mammals were lower in PCT stands than in CPRS and closed stands. Our results suggest that forest managers should exclude some stands from PCT following CPRS or natural perturbations, to maintain ecosystem diversity at the landscape level.},

	abstract = {In forest communities, species coexistence can be favoured by disturbance-related variations in light regime coupled with rank reversal in species performance. The objective of this study was to determine if a major canopy disturbance, resulting from an ice storm, would favour the coexistence of sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and beech (Fagus grandifolia) in an old-growth forest located near the northern limit of the species' range. The growth, density and frequency of occurrence of understorey stems were evaluated 7 years after the ice storm and compared with pre-disturbance values to determine if sugar maple, a slightly less shade-tolerant species, would be favoured over beech. Although height and radial growth increased three- to five-fold, and {\textgreater} 70\% of the 5-10 cm d.b.h. stems showed a release, sugar maple did not benefit more from the opening of the canopy than beech. The inability of sugar maple to outgrow beech might be related to the high proportion of beech root sprouts at our site, suggesting that the potential for the disturbancemediated mechanism to slow the competitive exclusion of maple might decrease as the importance of vegetative reproduction increases in beech. Prior to the disturbance, sugar maple was more abundant and occurred in a larger proportion of the plots among small size classes, while beech dominated in the larger size classes. Although some increases in the density of both species were detected after the disturbance, the general trends of relative abundance and distribution of the species were not modified significantly. Our results do not indicate that a single canopy disturbance such as the major 1998 ice storm significantly favoured sugar maple over beech. When a disturbance opens the canopy, competition for light in gaps may tend to maintain or reinforce a pre-existing hierarchy instead of reversing it, especially when interspecific differences in postdisturbance growth are small or absent, as in this study. This study shows that the dynamics of sugar maple - beech communities are more complex than previously envisaged and that revised models should incorporate additional factors (e.g. vegetative reproduction) that might also play an important role in regulating community dynamics. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 British Ecological Society.},

	abstract = {Aim: China's Grain for Green Program (GFGP) is the largest reforestation programme in the world and has been operating since 1999. The GFGP has promoted the establishment of tree plantations over the restoration of diverse native forests. In a previous study, we showed that native forests support a higher species richness and abundance of birds and bees than do GFGP plantations and that mixed-species GFGP plantations support a higher level of bird (but not bee) diversity than do any individual GFGP monocultures (although still below that of native forests). Here, we use metabarcoding of arthropod diversity to test the generality of these results. Location: Sichuan, China. Methods: We sampled arthropod communities using pan traps in the land cover types concerned under the GFGP. These land use types include croplands (the land cover being reforested under the GFGP), native forests (the reference ecosystem as the benchmark for the GFGP’s biodiversity effects) and the dominant GFGP reforestation outcomes: monoculture and mixed-species plantations. We used COI-amplicon sequencing (“metabarcoding”) of the arthropod samples to quantify and assess the arthropod community profiles associated with each land cover type. Results: Native forests support the highest overall levels of arthropod species diversity, followed by mixed-species plantations, followed by bamboo and other monocultures. Also, the arthropod community in native forests shares more species with mixed-species plantations than it does with any of the monocultures. Together, these results broadly corroborate our previous conclusions on birds and bees but show a higher arthropod biodiversity value of mixed-species plantations than previously indicated by bees alone. Main conclusion: In our previous study, we recommended that GFGP should prioritize the conservation and restoration of native forests. Also, where plantations are to be used, we recommended that the GFGP should promote mixed-species arrangements over monocultures. Both these recommendations should result in more effective protection of terrestrial biodiversity, which is an important objective of China's land-sustainability spending. The results of this study strengthen these recommendations because our policy prescriptions are now also based on a dataset that includes over 500 species-resolution taxa, ranging across the Arthropoda.},

The experimental site is located at Montmorency forest, 80 km north of Québec City. During the winters of 1981 and 1982, the snow water equivalent for the lake Laflamme watershed reached a maximum of 28 and 29 cm, respectively. The effect on snow accumulation by the small elevation range (50 m) was not detectable by our measurements. The snow water equivalent was greatest in open areas and appeared greater under the young than the older stands. The young fir associations, surrounded by higher trees, act as snow traps. The aspect plays a role during the melting period only, which is shortened by one week on south exposures. Snowmeit lasts one and a half month in average under the cover and is shortened by one to two weeks in the open. A snowmeit model, based on degree-days, is finally calibrated. The melt coefficient is readjusted for two periods separated by snow density or cumulative degree-days.},

	doi = {10.1111/1365-2745.12672},
	abstract = {Carbon allocation to growth, storage, reproduction and the effects of stress and disturbances on these processes remain poorly understood in trees. Non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) are an important component of the carbon storage pool and are commonly used to assess whether tree growth under various conditions is carbon limited. Carbon limitation is generally assumed to result in reduced NSC levels and allocation, but changes in allocation priorities that favour NSC storage could also limit carbon available for growth. We defoliated six mature oak trees in June 2010 and explored how defoliation affects the relationship between radial growth and net NSC storage, estimated by the seasonal increase in NSC concentration, for several years. We interpret our results in the context of a conceptual model of allocation – developed here – to help understand how allocation changed following defoliation. We also monitored flower and acorn production in 2011, as changes in reproduction could also affect allocation to growth and storage. Defoliation reduced radial growth for 3 years. Stemwood starch levels and storage were also generally reduced, although not as consistently as growth. In contrast, root collar NSC storage was significantly greater in defoliated trees, allowing below-ground stores to recover to control levels by November 2011. Defoliation had mixed effects on reproduction in 2011: production of second-year acorns (initiated before defoliation) was not significantly affected, but there was complete cessation of flower production. Defoliation also changed the relationship between NSC allocation and growth in the 2 years following defoliation, indicating a shift in allocation favouring storage. According to our conceptual model, the positive relationship between growth and NSC allocation indicates that the allocation shifts occurred under carbon-limiting conditions. We, therefore, propose that growth can be carbon limited by two different means: (i) a decrease in plant carbon availability and (ii) allocation shifts that reduce the priority of growth relative to other processes such as storage. Prioritizing storage over both growth and reproduction may be a strategy to protect against further disturbance or stress following storage depletion. Synthesis. Recovery following defoliation can involve substantial shifts in how trees allocate carbon between different functions, with carbohydrate storage and already initiated reproduction cycles being favoured relative to growth and new reproductive cycles.},

Likewise the heating, fertilization and defoliation treatments did not significantly affect the date of bud break. However, shading significantly delayed bud break. This delay in bud break could not be attributed to changes in leaf level photosynthetic traits, stem water content, leaf predawn water potential or delayed leaf fall.

We created the Community Mean Tolerance Index (CMTI), a response metric utilizing drought/shade tolerance trade-offs to identify communities undergoing demographic change from a functional trait perspective. We applied the CMTI to Forest Inventory and Analysis data to investigate demographic trends in drought and shade tolerance across the southern Rocky Mountains. To find the major drivers of change in community tolerance within and across forest types, we compared index trends to climate and fire-exclusion-driven disturbance, and identified areas where demographic change was most pronounced. We predicted that greater shifts in drought tolerance would occur at lower forest type ecotones where climate stress is limiting and that shifts in shade tolerance would correspond to excursions from the historic fire regime leading to greater changes in forest types adapted to frequent, low-intensity fire. The CMTI was applied spatially to identify sites likely to transition to oak shrubfield, where disturbance history combined with a species-driven demographic shift toward drought tolerance. Within forest types, lower elevations are trending toward increased drought tolerance, while higher elevations are trending toward increased shade tolerance. Across forest types, CMTI difference peaked in mid-elevation ponderosa pine and mixed-conifer forests, where fire exclusion and autecology drive demographic changes. Peak CMTI difference was associated with fire exclusion in forest types adapted to frequent fire. At higher elevations, site-level stand dynamics appear to be influencing demographic tolerance trends more than broad climate drivers. Through a community demographic approach to functional traits, the CMTI highlights areas and forest types where ecosystem function is in the process of changing, before persistent vegetation type change occurs. Applied to regional plot networks, the CMTI provides an early warning of shifts in community functional processes as climate change pressures continue.},

The method was used to develop spatial models of daily minimum and maximum temperature and daily precipitation for all of Canada, at a spatial resolution of 300 arc s of latitude and longitude, for the period 1961–2003. Each daily model was optimized automatically by minimizing the generalized cross validation. The fitted trivariate splines incorporated a spatially varying dependence on ground elevation and were able to adapt automatically to the large variation in station density over Canada. Extensive quality control measures were performed on the source data. Error estimates for the fitted surfaces based on withheld data across southern Canada were comparable to, or smaller than, errors obtained by daily interpolation studies elsewhere with denser data networks. Mean absolute errors in daily maximum and minimum temperature averaged over all years were 1.1° and 1.6°C, respectively. Daily temperature extremes were also well matched. Daily precipitation is challenging because of short correlation length scales, the preponderance of zeros, and significant error associated with measurement of snow. A two-stage approach was adopted in which precipitation occurrence was estimated and then used in conjunction with a surface of positive precipitation values. Daily precipitation occurrence was correctly predicted 83\% of the time. Withheld errors in daily precipitation were small, with mean absolute errors of 2.9 mm, although these were relatively large in percentage terms. However, mean percent absolute errors in seasonal and annual precipitation totals were 14\% and 9\%, respectively, and seasonal precipitation upper 95th percentiles were attenuated on average by 8\%. Precipitation and daily maximum temperatures were most accurately interpolated in the autumn, consistent with the large well-organized synoptic systems that prevail in this season. Daily minimum temperatures were most accurately interpolated in summer. The withheld data tests indicate that the models can be used with confidence across southern Canada in applications that depend on daily temperature and accumulated seasonal and annual precipitation. They should be used with care in applications that depend critically on daily precipitation extremes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Artificial defoliations were timed to coincide with the outbreaks of natural beetle populations in adjacent areas. After 2 growing seasons, trees were measured for height, diameter, and biomass accumulation. Root samples were collected from 0 and 75\% defoliation treatments and analyzed for total nonstructural carbohydrate content. Height, diameter, and above ground biomass decreased significantly with increasing defoliation for all clones. There was a significant difference in root and total biomass between 0 and 75\% defoliation treatments for each clone. Biomass was reduced an average of 33\% as defoliation level increased from 0 to 75\%, As defoliation level' increased from 0 to 75\%, a consistent allocation ratio of biomass to ¥.. above and v., below ground components continued in all clones. An overcompensation response occurred in above ground biomass when a defoliation level of 25\% was applied.

	abstract = {Droughts interact with tree phenology to drive declines in growth. As climate change makes drought more likely in the Northeastern USA, it is important to understand how droughts at different times of year will lead to reduced height and diameter growth of trees. To determine how seasonal drought may reduce intra-annual growth, we implemented spring, summer or fall droughts on 288 containerized saplings of six tree species (Acer rubrum, Betula papyrifera, Prunus serotina, Juniperus virginiana, Pinus strobus and Thuja occidentalis). We tracked weekly soil moisture, leaf water potential, height, diameter and survival of all trees before, during and after each 6-week drought. We found that the tree species that conducted the majority of their height or diameter growth in the spring were most sensitive to spring droughts (B. papyrifera and Pi. strobus). Thuja occidentalis also experienced significantly reduced growth from the spring drought but increased growth after the drought ended and achieved total height and diameter growth similar to controls. In contrast, summer droughts halted growth in most species for the remainder of the growing season even after the drought had ended. Fall droughts never impacted growth in the current year. These fine temporal-scale measurements of height and diameter growth suggest that tree response varies among species and is dynamic at intra-annual scales. These relatively rare data on intra-annual height growth sensitivity are important for canopy recruitment of saplings in forest ecosystems. Species-specific sensitivities of intra-annual growth to drought can inform models of forest competition in a changing climate.},

The ability of a species to track, via shifts in phenological events, the abiotic environment through time might dictate its vulnerability to future climate change. Understanding the predictors and drivers of phenological change is therefore critical. Here, we evaluated evidence for phylogenetic conservatism - the tendency for closely related species to share similar ecological and biological attributes - in phenological traits across flowering plants. We aggregated published and unpublished data on timing of first flower and first leaf, encompassing ̃4000 species at 23 sites across the Northern Hemisphere. We reconstructed the phylogeny for the set of included species, first, using the software program Phylomatic, and second, from DNA data. We then quantified phylogenetic conservatism in plant phenology within and across sites. We show that more closely related species tend to flower and leaf at similar times. By contrasting mean flowering times within and across sites, however, we illustrate that it is not the time of year that is conserved, but rather the phenological responses to a common set of abiotic cues. Our findings suggest that species cannot be treated as statistically independent when modelling phenological responses. Synthesis. Closely related species tend to resemble each other in the timing of their life-history events, a likely product of evolutionarily conserved responses to environmental cues. The search for the underlying drivers of phenology must therefore account for species' shared evolutionary histories.

	abstract = {Key message: Adaptation of forest management to climate change requires an understanding of the effects of climate on forests, industries and communities; prediction of how these effects might change over time; and incorporation of this knowledge into management decisions. This requires multiple forms of knowledge and new approaches to forest management decisions. Partnerships that integrate researchers from multiple disciplines with forest managers and local actors can build a shared understanding of future challenges and facilitate improved decision making in the face of climate change.Context: Climate change presents significant potential risks to forests and challenges for forest managers. Adaptation to climate change involves monitoring and anticipating change and undertaking actions to avoid the negative consequences and to take advantage of potential benefits of those changes.Aims: This paper aimed to review recent research on climate change impacts and management options for adaptation to climate change and to identify key themes for researchers and for forest managers.Methods: The study is based on a review of literature on climate change impacts on forests and adaptation options for forest management identified in the Web of Science database, focusing on papers and reports published between 1945 and 2013.Results: One thousand one hundred seventy-two papers were identified in the search, with the vast majority of papers published from 1986 to 2013. Seventy-six percent of papers involved assessment of climate change impacts or the sensitivity or vulnerability of forests to climate change and 11 \% (130) considered adaptation. Important themes from the analysis included (i) predicting species and ecosystem responses to future climate, (ii) adaptation actions in forest management, (iii) new approaches and tools for decision making under uncertainty and stronger partnerships between researchers and practitioners and (iv) policy arrangements for adaptation in forest management.Conclusions: Research to support adaptation to climate change is still heavily focused on assessing impacts and vulnerability. However, more refined impact assessments are not necessarily leading to better management decisions. Multi-disciplinary research approaches are emerging that integrate traditional forest ecosystem sciences with social, economic and behavioural sciences to improve decision making. Implementing adaptation options is best achieved by building a shared understanding of future challenges among different institutions, agencies, forest owners and stakeholders. Research-policy-practice partnerships that recognise local management needs and indigenous knowledge and integrate these with climate and ecosystem science can facilitate improved decision making.},

In this study we tested how different aspen seedling characteristics and planting times affect field outplanting performance on reclamation sites. We produced three different types of aspen planting stock, which varied significantly in seedling size, root-to-shoot ratio (RSR), and total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) reserves in roots, by artificially manipulating shoot growth during seedling production. All three stock types were then field-planted either in late summer, late fall, or early spring after frozen storage. Seedlings were outplanted onto two reclaimed open-pit mining areas in the boreal forest region of central and east-central Alberta, Canada, which varied significantly in latitude, reclamation history, and soil conditions. Overall, height growth was better in aspen stock types with high RSR and TNC reserves. Differences in field performance among aspen stock types appeared to be more strongly expressed when seedlings were exposed to more stressful environmental site conditions, such as low soil nutrients and moisture. Generally, aspen seedlings planted with leaves in the summer showed the poorest performance, and summer- or fall-planted seedlings with no shoot growth manipulation had much greater stem dieback after the first winter. This indicates that the dormancy and hardening of the stem, as a result of premature bud set treatments, could improve the outplanting performance of aspen seedlings, particularly those planted during summer and fall. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Fiori, one of 13 species of the Moringaceae family widely distributed throughout the dry tropics, has the potential to become one of the most economically important medicinal plants in Egypt. However, despite its tolerance for drought and heat, it is also threatened by increasing temperatures and decreasing precipitation. Although the phenophase of this species is well documented, almost nothing is known about its period of cambial activity in desert regions. Ring formation and the general environmental adaptability of trees are affected by the timing of cambial activation. In our study site, we observe a distinct coupling of the development of new green leaves at the onset of vegetative growth in October and the phase of cambial activity (November–January). The onset of cambial activity seems to be related to a drop in temperature in October and the onset of torrential rains in the region. There might even be a short phase between the end of cambial activity and the onset of bud formation without xylem formation, but with photosynthetic activity. If so, we assume that all assimilates are stored as non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) in the parenchyma of the new ring. This potential gap opens new questions regarding the correlation between NSC storage capacity and the timing of remobilization for subsequent ring formation.},

	abstract = {Plant phenological events are influenced by climate factors such as temperature and rainfall. To evaluate phenological responses to water availability in a Spring Heath-Pine wood (Erico-Pinetum typicum), the focus of this study was to determine intra-annual dynamics of apical and lateral growth of co-occurring early successional Larix decidua and Pinus sylvestris and late successional Picea abies exposed to drought. The effect of reduced plant water availability on growth phenology was investigated by conducting a rainfall exclusion experiment. Timing of key phenological dates (onset, maximum rate, end, duration) of growth processes were compared among species at the rain-sheltered and control plot during 2011 and 2012. Shoot and needle elongation were monitored on lateral branches in the canopy at c. 16. m height and radial growth was recorded by automatic dendrometers at c. 1.3m height of {\textgreater}120 yr old trees. Different sequences in aboveground growth phenology were detected among the three species under the same growing conditions. While onset of radial growth in April through early May was considerably preceded by onset of needle growth in Larix decidua (5-6 weeks) and shoot growth in Pinus sylvestris (c. 3 weeks), it occurred quite simultaneously with onset of shoot growth in Picea abies. Low water availability had a minor impact on onset of aboveground growth, which is related to utilization of stored water, but caused premature cessation of aboveground growth. At the control plot mean growing season length was 130 days in Pinus sylvestris, 95 days in Larix decidua and 73 days in Picea abies, supporting the hypothesis that early successional species are resource expenders, while late successional species are more efficient in utilizing resources and develop safer life strategies. High synchronicity found in culmination of radial growth in late spring (mid-May through early June) prior to occurrence of more favourable environmental conditions in summer might indicate sink competition for carbohydrates to belowground organs. This is supported by completion of apical growth in mid June in all species, except for needle growth of Pinus sylvestris which lasted until early August. Phenological observations of conifers exposed to drought revealed that tree water status early during the growing season determines total annual aboveground growth and, besides temperature, species-specific endogenous and/or environmental factors (most likely photoperiod and/or different threshold temperatures) are involved in controlling apical and lateral growth resumption after winter dormancy. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.},

Consequently, the effects of day–night conditions on tree growth remained uncertain. Here we present the first comprehensive field study of hourly-resolved radial stem growth of seven temperate tree species, based on 57 million underlying data points over a period of up to 8 yr. We show that trees grow mainly at night, with a peak after midnight, when the vapour pressure deficit (VPD) is among the lowest. A high VPD strictly limits radial stem growth and allows little growth during daylight hours, except in the early morning. Surprisingly, trees also grow in moderately dry soil when the VPD is low. Species-specific differences in diel growth dynamics show that species able to grow earlier during the night are associated with the highest number of hours with growth per year and the largest annual growth increment. We conclude that species with the ability to overcome daily water deficits faster have greater growth potential. Furthermore, we conclude that growth is more sensitive than carbon uptake to dry air, as growth stops before stomata are known to close.},

	abstract = {Insect defoliation impacts forest productivity worldwide, highlighting the relevance of plant-insect interactions. The larch budmoth (Zeiraphera griseana Hübner) is one of the most extensively studied defoliators, where numerous tree ring-based analyses on its host (Larix decidua Mill.) have aided in identifying outbreak dynamics over the past millennia. Yet, outbreaks have been widely absent after the early 1980s, and little is known about the in situ tree physiological responses and the allocation of carbon resources during and after defoliation. In summer 2018, we tracked an ongoing larch budmoth outbreak in a well-studied larch forest in the Swiss Alps. We performed biweekly monitoring on an affected and unaffected site using a unique combination of xylogenesis observations, measurements of non-structural carbohydrates, isotopic analysis of needle assimilates and ground-based and remote-sensed leaf trait observations. The budmoth induced a defoliation that lasted 40 days and could be detected by satellite observations. Soluble sugars significantly decreased in needles and stem phloem of the defoliated trees, while starch levels remained stable in the stem and root xylem compared to the control. Carbon and oxygen isotope ratios in needle assimilates indicated that neither photosynthetic assimilation rates nor stomatal conductance was different between sites before, during and after the outbreak. Defoliated trees ceased cell wall thickening 17 days earlier than unaffected trees, showing the earliest halt of ring formation recorded from 2007 untill 2013 and causing significant thinner cell walls, particularly in the latewood. No significant differences were found for cell enlargement rates and ring width. Our study revealed that an outbreak causes a downregulation of cell wall thickening first, while no starch is mobilized or leaf physiology is adjusted to compensate for the reduced carbon source due to defoliation. Our observations suggest that affected larch trees prioritize leaf recovery and carbon storage over wood biomass development.},

	abstract = {Defoliator insects are a major disturbance agent in many forests worldwide. During outbreaks, they can strongly reduce photosynthetic carbon uptake and impact tree growth. In the Alps, larch budmoth (Zeiraphera diniana) outbreaks affect European larch (Larix decidua) radial growth over several years. However, immediate and legacy effects on xylem formation, structure, and functionality are still largely unknown. In this study, we aimed at assessing the impact of budmoth defoliations on larch xylem anatomical features and tree-ring structure. Analyses were performed in the Lötschental (Swiss Alps) within (1,900 m a.s.l.) and above (2,200 m a.s.l.) the optimum elevational range of larch budmoth. We investigated variability of xylem anatomical traits along century-long tree-ring series of larch (host) and Norway spruce (non-host) trees. We identified eight outbreaks affecting larch xylem anatomy during the 20th century, particularly at 1,900 m a.s.l. Tracheid number always showed a higher percent reduction than properties of individual cells. Cell lumen size was slightly reduced in the first 2–3 years of outbreaks, especially in the early part of the ring. The more carbon-demanding cell wall was thinned along the entire ring, but more evidently in the last part. Theoretical tree-ring hydraulic conductivity was reduced for several years (up to 6), mostly due to cell number decrease. Reduced cell wall area and cell number resulted in a strong reduction of the tree-ring biomass, especially in the first year of outbreak. Our study shows that, under carbon source limitations caused by natural defoliation, cell division is more impacted than wall thickening and cell enlargement (the least affected process). Consequences on both xylem hydraulic properties and tree-ring biomass should be considered when assessing long-term defoliator effects on xylem functioning, forest dynamics, and terrestrial carbon cycle.},

	abstract = {In northern Europe, the northward movement of the sun in spring has so extensive an influence, that the food of all species of birds reaches its maximum at some time between late spring and early autumn. As a result, and in contrast to the tropics, nearly all species of birds lay their eggs in roughly the same period of the year. A review of the breeding seasons of British birds reveals some interesting correlations between time of breeding and time of maximum food, and also many apparent puzzles, particularly as regards the marked differences in breeding season sometimes found between related species. In Lapland, all species start breeding 1–2 months later than in Britain, and the breeding season is much less extended. As compared with Britain, the Corvidae and predatory birds of Lapland lay early relative to the small passerines, but among the small passerines, and also among the predators, the different species tend to breed in the same order relative to each other as they do in Britain. Quantitative measurement of breeding seasons is much needed, and some examples showing the advantages of this method are given in Tables 1–3 and text‐Figs. 1–5. It is considered that, through the action of natural selection, the breeding season of each species coincides with the time of year when offspring can be raised with greatest success. The major ultimate factor involved is, therefore, the food for the young birds (and hence the factors which determine the abundance and availability of this food). But there may be modifying ultimate factors concerned with the survival of the parents, of the nest and eggs, and of the juvenile birds in the period soon after they leave the nest. Proximate factors provide a physiological timing mechanism whereby the gonads recrudesce, and eggs are laid, at such a time that, on the average, the young hatch at a season when there is sufficient food to raise them. In European birds, daylength seems the major proximate factor, but there are several modifying factors, perhaps including temperature. Copyright © 1950, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

Individuals were markedly invariant in their response to environmental variation, suggesting that the current response may be fixed in this population. Phenotypic plasticity can thus play a central role in tracking environmental change; understanding the limits of plasticity is an important goal for future research.},

In two populations, we found 12 recent incidents of females with second broods, all produced by extremely early laying females in warm springs. As such early first broods are a recent phenomenon, because laying dates have gradually advanced over time, this innovation now allows individual females to enhance their reproductive success considerably. If laying dates continue advancing, potentially more females may become multiple breeders and selection for early (and multiple) breeding phenotypes increases, which may accelerate adaptation to climatic change.},

	abstract = {Numerous studies have correlated the advancement of lay date in birds with warming climate trends, yet the fitness effects associated with this phenological response have been examined in only a small number of species. Most of these species–primarily insectivorous cavity nesters in Europe–exhibit fitness declines associated with increasing asynchrony with prey. Here, we use 25 years of demographic data, collected from 1986 to 2010, to examine the effects of spring temperature on breeding initiation date, double brooding, and annual fecundity in a Nearctic - Neotropical migratory songbird, the black-throated blue warbler (Setophaga caerulescens). Data were collected from birds breeding at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, USA, where long-term trends toward warmer springs have been recorded. We found that black-throated blue warblers initiated breeding earlier in warmer springs, that early breeders were more likely to attempt a second brood than those starting later in the season, and that double brooding and lay date were linked to higher annual fecundity. Accordingly, we found selection favored earlier breeding in most years. However, in contrast to studies of several other long-distance migratory species in Europe, this selection pressure was not stronger in warmer springs, indicating that these warblers were able to adjust mean lay date appropriately to substantial inter-annual variation in spring temperature. Our results suggest that this North American migratory songbird might not experience the same fecundity declines as songbirds that are unable to adjust their timing of breeding in pace with spring temperatures.},

We predicted concordance between weather conditions and annual variation in phenology within a community of eight resident, cavity-nesting bird species over a 17-year period. We show that, although clutch initiation dates for six of our eight species are correlated with local daily maximum temperatures, this common driver does not produce a high degree of breeding synchrony due to species-specific responses to conditions during different periods of the preceding winter or spring. These “critical temperature periods” were positively associated with average lay date for each species, although the interval between critical periods and clutch initiation varied from 4–78 days. The ecological factors we examined (cavity availability and a food pulse) had an additional influence on timing in only one of our eight focal species. Our results have strong implications for understanding heterogeneous wildlife responses to climate change: divergent responses would be expected within communities where species respond to local conditions within different temporal windows, due to differing warming trends between winter and spring. Our system therefore indicates that climate change could alter relative breeding phenology among sympatric species in temperate ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Climate warming could lead to ‘mis-matching’ of birds’ breeding times with availability of their invertebrate food resources. Fluctuating spring temperatures could influence variation in the commencement of egg-laying, as well as, in phenology of their resources (e.g., tree bud burst, appearance of folivorous caterpillars). We studied timing of Dendrocopos leucotos, Dendrocoptes medius, Dendrocopos major, Dryobates minor, and Picoides tridactylus breeding in, free of direct human intervention, strictly protected fragments of Białowieża Forest (Poland) in 1975–2019. We related their onset of breeding to inter-year variation in spring weather, trees’ bud burst and timing of folivorous caterpillars’ availability. Individual species initiated breeding at dates differing by a month. In spite of intraseasonal differences in the absolute laying dates, sometimes exceeding three weeks, the sequence of laying by different species within a season was highly repeatable; D. leucotos commenced the first and P. tridactylus the last. Within a species and season, the females commenced laying synchronously; usually 50\% of them begun laying ≤ 8 days of each other. All species bred earlier when spring temperatures got higher. Nestling time of D. medius and D. major broadly coincided with ‘caterpillar peaks’, while D. minor young appeared too late. All woodpeckers advanced egg-laying in Białowieża National Park over 45 years but the inter-specific sequence of laying has been retained. These could be responses to strong advance of snow disappearance and to warming of the second half of April. The early recent laying dates remained within the range of earlier recorded ones, the early springs just became more frequent. Thus, the phenological acclimatization could be achieved by plastic behavioural and physiological adjustments. Lack of data on types of food actually used and their seasonal variation hinders mechanistic understanding of how warming would affect the future food supply and breeding performance of birds.},

We report here a method for the immunomagnetic isolation and novel primary culture of human exfoliated proximal tubular epithelial cells (HEPTECs) from fresh urine. The primary isolates are highly enriched and differentiated and express characteristic proximal tubular phenotypic markers. They continue to express the proximal tubular markers CD13/aminopeptidase-N, sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT) 2, and alkaline phosphatase through up to six subsequent subcultures in a similar way to human proximal cells isolated from renal biopsies. In a hyperglycemic environment, HEPTECs isolated from patients with type 2 diabetes expressed significantly more SGLT2 and the facilitative glucose transporter GLUT2 than cells from healthy individuals. We also demonstrated a markedly increased renal glucose uptake in HEPTECs isolated from patients with type 2 diabetes compared with healthy control subjects. Our findings indicate for the first time in a human cellular model that increased renal glucose transporter expression and activity is associated with type 2 diabetes. © 2005 by the American Diabetes Association.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} We previously demonstrated that typical American net acid-producing diets predict a low-grade metabolic acidosis of severity proportional to the diet net acid load as indexed by the steady-state renal net acid excretion rate (NAE). We now investigate whether a sodium (Na) chloride (Cl) containing diet likewise associates with a low-grade metabolic acidosis of severity proportional to the sodium chloride content of the diet as indexed by the steady-state Na and Cl excretion rates. In the steady-state preintervention periods of our previously reported studies comprising 77 healthy subjects, we averaged in each subject three to six values of blood hydrogen ion concentration ([H]b), plasma bicarbonate concentration ([HCO $_{\textrm{3}}$ $^{\textrm{−}}$ ]p), the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Pco $_{\textrm{2}}$ ), the urinary excretion rates of Na, Cl, NAE, and renal function as measured by creatinine clearance (CrCl), and performed multivariate analyses. Dietary Cl strongly correlated positively with dietary Na ( P \&lt; 0.001) and was an independent negative predictor of [HCO $_{\textrm{3}}$ $^{\textrm{−}}$ ]p after adjustment for diet net acid load, Pco $_{\textrm{2}}$ and CrCl, and positive and negative predictors, respectively, of [H]b and [HCO $_{\textrm{3}}$ $^{\textrm{−}}$ ]p after adjustment for diet acid load and Pco $_{\textrm{2}}$ . These data provide the first evidence that, in healthy humans, the diet loads of NaCl and net acid independently predict systemic acid-base status, with increasing degrees of low-grade hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis as the loads increase. Assuming a causal relationship, over their respective ranges of variation, NaCl has ∼50–100\% of the acidosis-producing effect of the diet net acid load. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In this double-blind crossover study, the effects of bolus infusions of 0.9\% saline (NaCl) and Hartmann's solution on serum albumin, haematocrit and serum and urinary biochemistry were compared in healthy subjects. Nine young adult male volunteers received 2-litre intravenous infusions of 0.9\% saline and Hartmann's solution on separate occasions, in random order, each over 1h. Body weight, haematocrit and serum biochemistry were measured pre-infusion and at 1h intervals for 6h. Biochemical analysis was performed on pooled post-infusion urine. Blood and plasma volume expansion, estimated by dilutional effects on haematocrit and serum albumin, were greater and more sustained after saline than after Hartmann's solution (P\&amp;lt;0.01). At 6h, body weight measurements suggested that 56\% of the infused saline was retained, in contrast with only 30\% of the Hartmann's solution. Subjects voided more urine (median: 1000 compared with 450ml) of higher sodium content (median: 122 compared with 73mmol) after Hartmann's than after saline (both P = 0.049), despite the greater sodium content of the latter. The time to first micturition was less after Hartmann's than after saline (median: 70 compared with 185min; P = 0.008). There were no significant differences between the effects of the two solutions on serum sodium, potassium, urea or osmolality. After saline, all subjects developed hyperchloraemia (\&amp;gt;105mmol/l), which was sustained for \&amp;gt;6h, while serum chloride concentrations remained normal after Hartmann's (P\&amp;lt;0.001 for difference between infusions). Serum bicarbonate concentration was significantly lower after saline than after Hartmann's (P = 0.008). Thus excretion of both water and sodium is slower after a 2-litre intravenous bolus of 0.9\% saline than after Hartmann's solution, due possibly to the more physiological [Na+]/[Cl-] ratio in Hartmann's solution (1.18:1) than in saline (1:1) and to the hyperchloraemia caused by saline.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Hypohydration, or a body water deficit, is a common occurrence in athletes and recreational exercisers following the completion of an exercise session. For those who will undertake a further exercise session that day, it is important to replace water losses to avoid beginning the next exercise session hypohydrated and the potential detrimental effects on performance that this may lead to. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the research related to factors that may affect postexercise rehydration. Research in this area has focused on the volume of fluid to be ingested, the rate of fluid ingestion, and fluid composition. Volume replacement during recovery should exceed that lost during exercise to allow for ongoing water loss; however, ingestion of large volumes of plain water results in a prompt diuresis, effectively preventing longer-term maintenance of water balance. Addition of sodium to a rehydration solution is beneficial for maintenance of fluid balance due to its effect on extracellular fluid osmolality and volume. The addition of macronutrients such as carbohydrate and protein can promote maintenance of hydration by influencing absorption and distribution of ingested water, which in turn effects extracellular fluid osmolality and volume. Alcohol is commonly consumed in the postexercise period and may influence postexercise rehydration, as will the coingestion of food. Future research in this area should focus on providing information related to optimal rates of fluid ingestion, advisable solutions to ingest during different duration recovery periods, and confirmation of mechanistic explanations for the observations outlined.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Before 2010, which is the year the World Anti-Doping Agency banned its use, glycerol was commonly used by athletes for hyperhydration purposes. Through its effect on osmoreceptors, we believe that sodium could prove a viable alternative to glycerol as a hyperhydrating agent. Therefore, this study compared the effects of sodium-induced hyperhydration (SIH), glycerol-induced hyperhydration (GIH) and water-induced hyperhydration (WIH) on fluid balance responses. Using a randomized, double-blind and counterbalanced protocol, 17 men (21 ± 3 years, 64 ± 6 kg fat-free mass (FFM)) underwent three 3-h hyperhydration protocols during which they ingested, over the first 60-min period, 30 mL/kg FFM of water with (i) an artificial sweetener (WIH); (ii) an artificial sweetener + 7.45 g/L of table salt (SIH); or (iii) an artificial sweetener + 1.4 g glycerol/kg FFM (GIH). Changes in body weight (BW), urine production, fluid retention, hemoglobin, hematocrit, plasma volume, and perceptual variables were monitored throughout the 3-h trials. After 3 h, SIH was associated with significantly (p \&lt; 0.05) lower hemoglobin, hematocrit (SIH: 43.1\% ± 2.8\%; GIH: 44.9\% ± 2.4\%), and urine production, as well as greater BW, fluid retention (SIH: 1144 ± 294 mL; GIH: 795 ± 337 mL), and plasma volume (SIH: 11.9\% ± 12.0\%; GIH: 4.0\% ± 6.0\%) gains, compared with GIH and WIH. No significant differences in heart rate or abdominal discomfort were observed between treatments. In conclusion, our results indicate that SIH is a superior hyperhydrating technique than, and proves to be a worthwhile alternative to, GIH.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The first is through axon gigantism: using axons several times larger in diameter than the norm for other large axons, as for example in the well-known case of the squid giant axon. The second is through encasing axons in helical or concentrically wrapped multilamellar sheets of insulating plasma membrane - the myelin sheath. Each mechanism, alone or in combination, is employed in nervous systems of many taxa, both vertebrate and invertebrate. Myelin is a unique way to increase conduction speeds along axons of relatively small caliber. It seems to have arisen independently in evolution several times in vertebrates, annelids and crustacea. Myelinated nerves, regardless of their source, have in common a multilamellar membrane wrapping, and long myelinated segments interspersed with 'nodal' loci where the myelin terminates and the nerve impulse propagates along the axon by 'saltatory' conduction. For all of the differences in detail among the morphologies and biochemistries of the sheath in the different myelinated animal classes, the function is remarkably universal. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Acetylcholine is a neurochemical that has a wide variety of functions in the brain and other organ systems of the body. Specifically, it is a neurotransmitter that acts as a chemical message that is released by neurons and allows them to communicate with one another as well as other specialized cells such as myocytes and cells found in glandular tissues. The name "acetylcholine" is derived from its chemical structure, as it is an ester of acetic acid and choline. Tissues of the body that use this chemical messenger or are responsive to it are referred to as cholinergic. There is a class of chemicals called anticholinergics that interfere with acetylcholine's action on tissues as well.  While ACh operates as a neurotransmitter in many parts of the body, it is most commonly associated with the neuromuscular junction. The neuromuscular junction is where motor neurons located in the ventral spinal cord synapse with muscles in the body to activate them. Acetylcholine also functions as a neurotransmitter in the autonomic nervous system, acting both as the neurotransmitter between preganglionic and postganglionic neurons as well as being the final release product from parasympathetic postganglionic neurons.[1]},

	abstract = {It has recently become apparent that in the dendrites or short axons of some neurons, voltage-dependent sodium channels are used not to generate action potentials but to modulate graded potentials; graded potentials carry far more information than do action potentials. A model axon (or dendrite) is described in which sodium channels with kinetics described by equations of the Hodgkin-Huxley type boost conduction of small voltage signals. For a sodium channel density beyond a certain minimum there exists an optimal potential, depolarized with respect to the resting potential, at which there is no steady-state decrement along the axon. For an axon not longer than about 0.7 length constants, small, steady-state deviations from this optimal potential imposed at one end of the axon appear amplified in a graded and stable way at the other end. A small pulse of potential is propagated with amplification and more rapidly than in an axon with a passive membrane. Compared to passive propagation, there will be an improvement in signal-to-noise ratio at the synapse; the axon also acts as a selective frequency filter. The same axon is capable of conducting an action potential. © 1995 Academic Press.},

Tension was reduced to 21 +/- 1 and 54 +/- 2\% (SE) of the initial value after high- and low-frequency stimulation, respectively. After 0, 0.25, 1, and 2 min of recovery from high-frequency stimulation, 5 Hz elicited more force (expressed as \% of initial tension) than 75-Hz stimulation. Time 0 recovery values were 21 +/- 1 and 78 +/- 6\% of the initial force for 75- and 5-Hz stimulation, respectively. By 1 min of recovery, force elicited by 5-Hz stimulation had returned to the prefatigue value. In contrast, force production with 75-Hz stimulation did not full recover until 10–15 min. After fatigue produced by low-frequency stimulation, force production with 5-Hz stimulation was reduced to 54 +/- 2\% of the initial tension, a value significantly lower than the 71 +/- 2\% of initial force elicited by 75-Hz stimulation. Force production with 5-Hz stimulation increased rapidly in the first 15 s of recovery (54 +/- 2\% at 0 and 70 +/- 2\% at 15 s) and by 5 min was significantly greater than the force elicited by 75-Hz stimulation (100 +/- 3 vs. 93 +/- 1\%). As before, force production at 75-Hz stimulation did not fully recover until 10–15 min. Both fatigue protocols produced a significant prolongation in isometric twitch contraction and one-half relaxation times.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Nerve conduction studies are performed to diagnose the disorders of the peripheral nervous system. The reference values for nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and late responses for different nerves considerably vary in different group and type of population. Physiological factors such as age, temperature, height, and gender affect the NCV. However, there are very few studies which show the age group at which these changes become significant. Aim and Objectives: The aim of the study was to establish the electrophysiological data of the specific age group at which changes in NCV as well as late responses of median common peroneal nerve and also see the late response in the form of F-waves and H-reflex. Methodology: Study groups were divided into three categories based on the age: Group I (18–30 years) (n = 80), Group II (31–45 years) (n = 43), and Group III (46–60 years) (n = 27). Out of which, 93 patients were male and 57 were female. The NCVs were determined for median, common peroneal nerve (motor component and sensory component) along with late responses in the form of H-reflex and F-waves. Results: The mean and standard deviation of median, ulnar, peroneal, and tibial nerve was studied for latencies, amplitude, and velocities for both sensory and motor components. Patients with older age had longer latencies, smaller amplitudes, and slower conduction velocities compared with the younger age group. The change with age was greater in sensory nerve conduction and late responses in all the peripheral nerves. Conclusions: Aging has a definite correlation with the NCV and late responses of different peripheral nerves. There is a need to have reference values with relation to age.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}A mathematical model of the membrane action potential of the mammalian ventricular cell is introduced. The model is based, whenever possible, on recent single-cell and single-channel data and incorporates the possibility of changing extracellular potassium concentration [K]o. The fast sodium current, INa, is characterized by fast upstroke velocity (Vmax = 400 V/sec) and slow recovery from inactivation. The time-independent potassium current, IK1, includes a negative-slope phase and displays significant crossover phenomenon as [K]o is varied. The time-dependent potassium current, IK, shows only a minimal degree of crossover. A novel potassium current that activates at plateau potentials is included in the model. The simulated action potential duplicates the experimentally observed effects of changes in [K]o on action potential duration and rest potential. Physiological simulations focus on the interaction between depolarization and repolarization (i.e., premature stimulation). Results demonstrate the importance of the slow recovery of INa in determining the response of the cell. Simulated responses to periodic stimulation include monotonic Wenckebach patterns and alternans at normal [K]o, whereas at low [K]o nonmonotonic Wenckebach periodicities, aperiodic patterns, and enhanced supernormal excitability that results in unstable responses ("chaotic activity") are observed. The results are consistent with recent experimental observations, and the model simulations relate these phenomena to the underlying ionic channel kinetics.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In both axons, conduction velocity increased more than 4‐fold in the growth period examined. Correlated with the increase in conduction velocity is an increase in axon diameter and the relationship between these two parameters is expressed by the equation CV = krx, where x equals 0.5 for the lateral and 0.7 for the medial giant axons. The sheath surrounding the giant axons also increases in size during growth with that of the medial giant axon being considerably thicker than that of the lateral giant axon. The significance of the increase in axon diameters is to increase conduction velocity and thereby reduce the latency of the escape response mediated by these giant axons.

	abstract = {Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) accounts for approximately 90\% of all focal entrapment neuropathy, making it a frequent electrodiagnostic consultation. It is present in about 3.8\% of the general population. It is more common in women than in men, and while it occurs in all age groups, incidence generally reaches a peak within the age of 40 to 60 years. Hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, peripheral edema, acromegaly, tumors, trauma, and pregnancy are risk factors that predispose patients to develop CTS. Furthermore, patients whose occupations rely on the hands' repetitive movements and those with forceful hand movements are also prone to developing CTS. The clinical presentation typically reveals numbness, weakness, and paresthesias within the thumb, index, middle, and radial side of the ring finger. The thenar area has normal sensation as the palmar cutaneous sensory branch innervates it, which does not pass through the carpal tunnel. However, the recurrent thenar motor branch does pass through the carpal tunnel and gives innervation to the opponens pollicis, abductor pollicis brevis, and superficial head of the flexor pollicis brevis. Patients' symptoms tend to worsen at night or during the hand's repetitive movements, especially those requiring prolonged wrist flexion. Depending on the severity of the patient's symptoms, they can categorize into three stages. Stage 1 presents with frequent awakenings at night due to tingling in their hands and fingers, which may last through the morning with associated stiffness. Stage 2 shows symptoms that are also present during the day. Motor deficits may also be apparent with patients reporting dropping objects from their hands. Stage 3, the final stage, demonstrates atrophy of the thenar muscles and may respond poorly to surgical decompression.},

Naive CD4 $^{\textrm{+}}$ T cells are activated after interaction with antigen-MHC complex and differentiate into specific subtypes depending mainly on the cytokine milieu of the microenvironment. Besides the classical T-helper 1 and T-helper 2, other subsets have been identified, including T-helper 17, regulatory T cell, follicular helper T cell, and T-helper 9, each with a characteristic cytokine profile. For a particular phenotype to be differentiated, a set of cytokine signaling pathways coupled with activation of lineage-specific transcription factors and epigenetic modifications at appropriate genes are required. The effector functions of these cells are mediated by the cytokines secreted by the differentiated cells. This paper will focus on the cytokine-signaling and the network of transcription factors responsible for the differentiation of naive CD4 $^{\textrm{+}}$ T cells. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Dendritic cells (DCs) play a significant role in establishing self-tolerance through their ability to present self-antigens to developing T cells in the thymus. DCs are predominantly localized in the medullary region of thymus and present a broad range of self-antigens, which include tissue-restricted antigens expressed and transferred from medullary thymic epithelial cells, circulating antigens directly captured by thymic DCs through coticomedullary junction blood vessels, and peripheral tissue antigens captured and transported by peripheral tissue DCs homing to the thymus. When antigen-presenting DCs make a high affinity interaction with antigen-specific thymocytes, this interaction drives the interacting thymocytes to death, a process often referred to as negative selection, which fundamentally blocks the self-reactive thymocytes from differentiating into mature T cells. Alternatively, the interacting thymocytes differentiate into the regulatory T (Treg) cells, a distinct T cell subset with potent immune suppressive activities. The specific mechanisms by which thymic DCs differentiate Treg cells have been proposed by several laboratories. Here, we review the literatures that elucidate the contribution of thymic DCs to negative selection and Treg cell differentiation, and discusses its potential mechanisms and future directions.},

	abstract = {It is now recognized that dendritic cells (DC) isolated from mouse spleen play an important role in activating T lymphocytes. These DC, which show many similarities to veiled cells found in afferent lymph and interdigitating cells found in the paracortical regions of spleen and lymph node, may be closely related to the epidermal Langerhans cells. It is known that DC are extremely effective allostimulators. We have also found that although DC lack demonstrable phagocytic ability, they are extremely potent at presenting soluble polypeptide antigens to primed T cells. Since T lymphocytes comprise several distinct subsets (particularly cytotoxic, helper, and suppressor) in our most recent studies we have asked whether DC are able to trigger all these different subsets of T cells. We examined the ability of different spleen cell types coupled with the hapten NP to induce antigen-specific T suppressors for a delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) response. It was found that T suppressors were generated only when hapten was conjugated to a spleen-derived antigen-presenting cell. Further analysis revealed that macrophages but not DC were able to induce defined sets of suppressor cells in vivo (although DC were able to trigger a very powerful DTH response). We also examined the ability of DC to activate T cells which are required to cooperate with B cells in the production of antibody. Even though DC were able to trigger T lymphocytes to produce lymphokines, these activated T cells did not act as helper cells in a standard hapten-carrier system. Possible mechanisms for this dichotomy of DC function are discussed.},

Using real-time PCR experiments, we show that isolated adipocytes from humans and mice AT express high levels of CD14 and CD68 mRNA, whereas EMR1-F4/80 is mainly present in the macrophage-containing stroma-vascular fraction. Furthermore, fibroblasts-like cells (adipoblasts), preadipocytes and adipocytes from the murine cell lines, 3T3-F442A and BFC-1, express CD14 and CD68 mRNA and protein as determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter, but not F4/80 which, as expected, is strongly expressed in the macrophage cell line RAW264.7.

In mice, CD83 expression by thymic stromal cells regulates CD4+ T cell development, with CD83-/- mice demonstrating dramatic reductions in both thymus and peripheral CD4+ T cells. In this study, CD83 expression was also found to affect MHC class II antigen expression within the thymus and periphery. CD83 deficiency reduced cell-surface class II antigen expression by 25-50\% on splenic B cells and DCs, thymic epithelial cells and peritoneal macrophages. Reduced class II expression was a stable and intrinsic property that resulted from increased internalization of class II from the surface of CD83-/- B cells. Otherwise, class II antigen transcription, intracellular expression, heterodimer structure, antigen processing and antigen presentation were normal. Reduced class II antigen expression was not the primary cause of the CD83-/- phenotype since thymocyte and peripheral T cell development was normal in class II+/- mice. Comparable blocks in CD4+ thymocyte development were also observed in CD83-/- and CD83-/-class II+/- littermates. TCR and CD69 expression patterns in CD83-/- mice further suggested that double-positive thymocytes proceed through the class II-dependent stages of positive selection in the absence of CD83. These studies further emphasize a role for CD83 in lymphocyte development and immune regulation and reveal an unexpected role for CD83 expression in influencing cell-surface MHC class II turnover. © The Japanese Society for Immunology. 2007.

NOSII and TNFα are central genes in innate immunity and are thought to be differentially regulated by the MyD88 versus TRIF signalling pathways. Here, we have used Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus, Gram-negative Escherichia coli and highly selective TLR ligands to establish the precise relationship between TLR2, TLR1, TLR6 and TLR4 for NOSII versus TNFα induction. 2 In murine macrophages at 24 h, E. coli or LPS (TLR4) induced NO and TNFα release. In contrast, S. aureus (TLR2/TLR1/TLR6) or Pam 3CSK4 (TLR2/TLR1), or FSL-1 and LTA (TLR2/TLR6) induced TNFα without an effect on NO. 3 At later time points (48-72 h), S. aureus induced NO release. The ability of S. aureus, but not E. coli or LPS, to induce NO release was inhibited by anti-TNFα-binding antibodies. 4 At 24 h, LPS synergised with TLR2 ligands to induce NO release and NOSII protein expression. LPS also induced the expression of TLR2 gene expression without affecting levels of TLR4. 5 Using cells from TLR2 -/- or TLR4 -/- mice, the ability of LPS to synergise with S. aureus or Pam 3CSK4 was found to be dependent on both TLR2 and TLR4. 6 These observations are the first to clearly delineate the role of separately activating TLR2 and TLR4 in the induction of NOSII and TNFα genes compared with their coinduction when both receptor pathways are activated. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.},

Current knowledge of the specific biochemical cascades involved in this IFN-γ-inducible Mφ function is still limited. In the present study, we evaluated the participation of various second messengers - Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1α, MAP kinase kinase (MEK1/2), extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (Erk1/Erk2) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) - in the regulation of NO production by IFN-γ-stimulated J774 murine Mφ. The use of specific signalling inhibitors permitted us to establish that JAK2/STAT1α- and Erk1/Erk2-dependent pathways are the main players in IFN-γ-inducible Mφ NO generation. To determine whether the inhibitory effect was taking place at the pre- and/or post-transcriptional level, we evaluated the effect of each antagonist on inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene and protein expression, and on the capacity of IFN-γ to induce JAK2, Erk1/Erk2 and STAT1α phosphorylation. All downregulatory effects occurred at the pretranscriptional level, except for NF-κB, which seems to exert its role in NO production through an iNOS-independent event. In addition, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) analysis revealed that STAT1α is essential for IFN-γ-inducible iNOS expression and NO production, whereas the contribution of NF-κB to this cellular regulation seems to be minimal. Moreover, our data suggest that Erk1/Erk2 are responsible for STAT1α Ser727 residue phosphorylation in IFN-γ-stimulated Mφ, thus contributing to the full activation of STAT1α. Taken together, our results indicate that JAK2, MEK1/2, Erk1/Erk2 and STAT1α are key players in the IFN-γ-inducible generation of NO by Mφ.},

Monocyte depletion reduced ILl0 production by 90\% and resulted in an increased IFN-γ production. Addition of anti-IL-10 antibody to PBMC cultures also strongly increased IFN-γ production. In contrast, among various cytokines, only IFN-γ strongly reduced IL-10 synthesis by SAC- or LPS-activated PBMC and monocytes. Thus, IFN-γ has proinflammatory effects through the combination of two mechanisms: (a) induction of early tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and IL-1β synthesis; and (b) inhibition of the ddayed production of IL-10, an inhibitor of TNF-α and IL-1β synthesis.

To understand the synergistic effect of IFN-γ and TNF-α activation, and LPS stimulation on iNOS expression dynamics and NO production, we developed a systems biology based mathematical model. Using our model, we investigated the impact of pre-infection cytokine exposure, or priming, on the system. We explored the essentiality of IFN-γ priming to the robustness of initial proinflammatory response with respect to the ability of macrophages to produce reactive species needed for pathogen clearance. Results from our theoretical studies indicated that IFN-γ and subsequent activation of IRF1 are essential in consequential production of iNOS upon LPS stimulation. We showed that IFN-γ priming at low concentrations greatly increases the effector response of macrophages against intracellular pathogens. Ultimately the model demonstrated that although TNF-α contributed towards a more rapid response time, measured as time to reach maximum iNOS production, IFN-γ stimulation was significantly more significant in terms of the maximum expression of iNOS and the concentration of NO produced.},

In this study, we examined the profile of cytokines expressed in macrophages of mice after stimulation with full-length form of recombinant LSO (rLSO530), C-terminal-truncated protein (rLSO483) and two authentic cytokine-inducing Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands from bacteria, peptidoglycan (PGN) and LPS. Both rLSO530 and rLSO483 were able to induce IL-12 p40 and IL-12 p70 more strongly in macrophages than PGN or LPS. In contrast, IFN-β and nitric oxide were induced by LPS but not by rLSO530, rLSO483 or PGN. In the presence of exogenously added IFN-β, IL-12 p40 and IL-12 p70 production was inhibited after LSO stimulation, but IL-12 p70 production was enhanced after PGN stimulation. Although LSO signaling appeared to be associated with both TLR2 and TLR4, the profile of cytokine production by LSO stimulation was distinct from those by stimulation with PGN or LPS. Thus, it was shown that LSO is a unique bacterial ligand that induces macrophage cytokine production in a manner different from PGN or LPS. © The Japanese Society for Immunology. 2005.

In this study we found that E. coli K1 was able to enter, survive, and replicate intracellularly in both murine and human macrophage cell lines, as well as in monocytes and macrophages of newborn rats. In addition, we demonstrated that OmpA+ E. coli also enters and replicates in human peripheral blood monocytes in vitro. Outer membrane protein A (OmpA) expression on E. coli contributes to binding to macrophages, phagocytosis, and survival within macrophages. Opsonization with either complement proteins or antibody is not required for uptake and survival of the bacteria within the macrophages. Transmission electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry studies with the infected macrophages indicated that OmpA+ E. coli multiplies enormously in a single phagosome and bursts the cell. Internalization of OmpA+ E. coli by RAW 264.7 cells occurred by both actin- and microtubule-dependent processes, which are independent of RGD-mediated integrin receptors. Internalization and intracellular survival within phagocytic cells thus may play an important role in the development of bacteremia, which is crucial for E. coli crossing of the blood-brain barrier.},

The purpose of this study was to characterize the binding of cytochalasins to rabbit alveolar macrophages. Kinetic and quantitative binding experiments demonstrated rapid, temperature dependent attachment of [3H]CB (tritium labeled cytochalasin B) to high (0.4 M) and low (10 M) affinity sites. Macrophages possessed a larger number of high affinity sites (1.8 × 107 sites/cell) than erythrocytes, lymphocytes, granulocytes, and other cell types so far examined. CB was the best inhibitor of high affinity [3H] CB binding, although CA, CD, and CE were also highly effective. However, cytochalasins A, E, and D were considerably more potent inhibitors of low affinity [3H] CB binding sites than CB. In contrast to cytochalasins A and E, CB binding was easily reversible, while cytochalasin D binding was partially reversible. A wide variety of pharmacologic agents, including cyclic nucleotides and sulfhydryl containing or reactive compounds, had minimal inhibitory or no effect on either low or high affinity cytochalasin binding to intact cells. Vinblastine but not colchicine augmented [3H] CB binding. Radioautography demonstrated that most of the high affinity [3H] CB binding sites appeared to be located in or adjacent to the plasma membrane. The previously described alterations in macrophage function induced by cytochalasins required relatively high concentrations and our data suggest that low affinity sites would be primarily involved in mediating these changes. © 1978 Academic Press, Inc.

The responses of the two species to both types of nutrient deprivation can be divided into two phases: an early sucrose and starch accumulating phase, lasting for 8–10 days, and a late phase during which these carbohydrate levels decreased. During the first phase, the rate of the dark respiration decreased sharply whereas the CO2 assimilation rate decreased only slightly. An increase in the photosynthesis/respiration ratio had already become apparent after 2 days of growth on the nutrient deficient media. In the later phase, the starch and sucrose pools decreased to levels even lower than the initial ones. Simultaneously the relative decrease in CO2 assimilation rate surpassed the decrease in dark respiration rate, i.e. the photosynthesis/respiration ratio began to decrease, eventually falling below the initial value measured on day o.

One-year-old plants were grown in pots and subjected to four nitrogen levels for 58 days. Nitrogen-deficient plants had significant lower leaf nitrogen and chlorophyll a contents. They also showed a significant reduction in their photosynthetic capacity. A tolerance difference between cultivars was observed: 'Meski' proved to be more efficient in maintaining CO2 assimilation rates than 'Koroneiki' under nitrogen deficiency, which was reflected by increased photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency. Accumulation of carbohydrates, especially starch, mannitol, sucrose and glucose, was observed in nitrogen-deficient leaves. This indicates that both the high carbohydrate and the low nitrogen content inhibit photosynthesis in nitrogen-deprived olive plants. Total biomass was strongly reduced (mainly caused by a decrease in leaf dry weight) under nitrogen deficiency for both cultivars, but root:shoot ratio was hardly affected.

Nitrogen starvation decreased plant growth and the leaves' total nitrogen, amino acids, proteins, chlorophylls and carotenoids contents indicating that the primary metabolism was severely limited by low nitrogen availability. The amount of total phenolics and the antioxidant capacity were higher in leaves and roots of nitrogen-starved compared to control plants. The most abundant phenolic acids identified in yarrow were 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid (chlorogenic acid), and 3,5 and 4,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acids.

These stresses triggered a more than 2-fold increase in the production of total phenols and their representatives, anthocyanins (up to 18-fold), flavonoids (up to 4.7-fold), and condensed tannins (up to 2.7-fold), which led to intense red coloration of the leaves. These changes were also associated with an increase in the concentration of carbohydrates and a decrease in concentrations of lipids and total proteins. Changes in lipid biosynthesis did not cause significant changes in concentrations of palmitoleic acid (C16:0), linolenic acid (C18:3), and linoleic acid (C18:2), the fatty acid signatures of Azolla species. However, a reduction in protein production triggered changes in biosynthesis of alanine, arginine, leucine, tyrosine, threonine, valine, and methionine amino acids. Stress-triggered changes in key nutritional components, phenolics, lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates could have a significant impact on the nutritional value of both Azolla species, which are widely used as a sustainable food supplement for livestock, poultry, and fish industries.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Environmental stresses such as high light, low temperatures, pathogen infection and nutrient deficiency can lead to increased production of free radicals and other oxidative species in plants. A growing body of evidence suggests that plants respond to these biotic and abiotic stress factors by increasing their capacity to scavenge reactive oxygen species. Efforts to understand this acclimatory process have focused on the components of the ‘classical’ antioxidant system, i.e. superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, catalase, monodehydroascorbate reductase, glutathione reductase and the low molecular weight antioxidants ascorbate and glutathione. However, relatively few studies have explored the role of secondary metabolic pathways in plant response to oxidative stress. A case in point is the phenylpropanoid pathway, which is responsible for the synthesis of a diverse array of phenolic metabolites such as flavonoids, tannins, hydroxycinnamate esters and the structural polymer lignin. These compounds are often induced by stress and serve specific roles in plant protection, i.e. pathogen defence, ultraviolet screening, antiherbivory, or structural components of the cell wall. This review will highlight a novel antioxidant function for the taxonomically widespread phenylpropanoid metabolite chlorogenic acid (CGA; 5- {\textless}italic{\textgreater}O{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} -caffeoylquinic acid) and assess its possible role in abiotic stress tolerance. The relationship between CGA biosynthesis and photosynthetic carbon metabolism will also be discussed. Based on the properties of this model phenolic metabolite, we propose that under stress conditions phenylpropanoid biosynthesis may represent an alternative pathway for photochemical energy dissipation that has the added benefit of enhancing the antioxidant capacity of the cell. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Phenolics are produced under optimal and suboptimal conditions in plants and play key roles in developmental processes like cell division, hormonal regulation, photosynthetic activity, nutrient mineralization, and reproduction. Plants exhibit increased synthesis of polyphenols such as phenolic acids and flavonoids under abiotic stress conditions, which help the plant to cope with environmental constraints. Phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway is activated under abiotic stress conditions (drought, heavy metal, salinity, high/low temperature, and ultraviolet radiations) resulting in accumulation of various phenolic compounds which, among other roles, have the potential to scavenge harmful reactive oxygen species. Deepening the research focuses on the phenolic responses to abiotic stress is of great interest for the scientific community. In the present article, we discuss the biochemical and molecular mechanisms related to the activation of phenylpropanoid metabolism and we describe phenolic-mediated stress tolerance in plants.

Two-week-old, nonnodulated soybean plants (Glycine max [L.] Merrill, ;Ransom'), grown previously on complete nutrient solutions with 1.0 millimolar NO(3) (-), were transferred to solutions without a nitrogen source at the beginning of a dark period. Daily changes in starch and sucrose levels of leaves were monitored over the following 5 to 8 days in three experiments. Starch accumulation increased relative to controls throughout the leaf canopy during the initial two light periods after plant exposure to N-free solutions, but not after that time as photosynthesis declined. The additional increments of carbon incorporated into starch appeared to be quantitatively similar to the amounts of carbon diverted from amino acid synthesis in the same tissues. Since additional accumulated starch was not degraded in darkness, starch levels at the beginning of light periods also were elevated. In contrast to the starch effects, leaf sucrose concentration was markedly higher than controls at the beginning of the first light period after the N-limitation was imposed. In the days which followed, diurnal turnover patterns were similar to controls. In source leaves, the activity of sucrose-P synthase did not decrease until after day 3 of the N-limitation treatment, whereas the concentration of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate was decreased on day 2. Restricted growth of sink leaves was evident with N-limited plants within 2 days, having been preceeded by a sharp decline in levels of fructose-2,6 bisphosphate on the first day of treatment. The results suggest that changes in photosynthate partitioning in source leaves of N-stressed plants resulted largely from a stable but limited capacity for sucrose formation, and that decreased sucrose utilization in sink leaves contributed to the whole-plant diversion of carbohydrate from the shoot to the root.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Mineral elements stored in seed reserves meet the nutrient demands of seedlings during their initial development and growth. We experimentally examined when seed reserves become insufficient to meet demands for nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) of seedlings of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, a tropical woody legume. Seedlings were grown from seeds with four nutrient treatments: receiving all nutrients; all nutrients except N, all nutrients except P or deionised water. Growth curves were compared to quantify the time course of the onset of N and P deficiency during 8 weeks. N deficiency became significant for leaf area and biomass growth after 11 and 16 days, respectively, whereas P deficiency became significant after 31 days for both leaf area and biomass growth. Thus, seed reserves alone could support the P demands of seedlings for more than twice as long as N demands. As nutrient deficiency developed, seedlings adjusted increased relative biomass allocation to roots, diluted organ N and P concentrations but conserved 100\% of the initial nutrient pool derived from the seed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The allocation of N and P in plant vegetative organs (i.e., leaves, stems, and fine roots) is critical to the regulation of plant growth and development. However, how these elements are allocated in seeds is unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the N and P allocation strategies of seeds in an alpine meadow along an altitudinal gradient. We measured the seed N and P contents of 253 herbaceous species in 37 families along an altitudinal gradient (2,000–4,200 m) in the east Tibetan alpine meadow. The geometric means of seed N and P concentrations and N:P ratios were 34.81 mg g $^{\textrm{–1}}$ , 5.06 mg g $^{\textrm{–1}}$ , and 6.88, respectively. Seed N and P concentrations varied across major taxonomic groups and among different altitude zones. N:P ratios showed no significant variations among different taxonomic groups with the exception of N-fixing species. The numerical value of the scaling exponent of seed N vs. P was 0.73, thus approaching 3/4, across the entire data set, but varied significantly across major taxonomic groups. In addition, the numerical value of the scaling exponent of N vs. P declined from 0.88 in the high altitude zone to 0.63 in the low altitude zone. These results indicate that the variations in the numerical value of the scaling exponent governing the seed N vs. P scaling relationship varies as a function of major taxonomic groups and among different altitude zones. We speculate that this variation reflects different adaptive strategies for survival and germination in an alpine meadow. If true, the data presented here advance our understanding of plant seed allocation strategies, and have important implications for modeling early plant growth and development. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Visual symptoms of N deficiency are probably the most definitive of nutrient deficiency symptoms.

Stem tissue appears the most suitable plant part to sample and analyze for evaluation of N status of actively growing annual crops.

We predicted the essential reactions and the associated genes of chlorophyll synthesis and validated against the existing experimental evidences. Further, ammonia is known to be the preferred source of nitrogen in rice paddy fields. The ammonia entering into the plant is assimilated in the root and leaf. The focus of the present work is centered on rice leaf metabolism. We studied the relative importance of ammonia transporters through the chloroplast and the cytosol and their interlink with other intracellular transporters. Ammonia assimilation in the leaves takes place by the enzyme glutamine synthetase (GS) which is present in the cytosol (GS1) and chloroplast (GS2). Our results provided possible explanation why GS2 mutants show normal growth under minimum photorespiration and appear chlorotic when exposed to air.},

	abstract = {Simple Summary: Crops are the primary feedstock for the production of food/feed and energy, and our dependency on them has been increasing over the last decade. Climate change, reduced land for active agriculture, increased population, reduced amount of clean water, and high costs of chemical fertilizers and energy make modern agriculture unsustainable. Demands are rising for the next generation of cheap and sustainable feedstock, which could be productive under existing conditions. Aquatic plants, such as the free-floating species duckweed and Azolla, have started attracting attention because of their unique features, presenting advantages over terrestrial plants. Terrestrial plants grow on the land or need to be on dry land to survive. On the other hand, aquatic plants have the ability to thrive in ponds under controlled conditions using wastewaters as a source of nutrients. Over the last decade, Azolla species became an attractive feedstock for livestock because of their accumulation of valuable products, phenolic compounds, proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates. Stress-triggered changes in these nutritional components could have a significant impact on the nutritional value of Azolla, which is used as a sustainable food supplement for livestock, poultry, and fish industries. This paper aims to assess the effects of environmental and nutrient stresses on the biosynthesis of valuable metabolites in Azolla. Abstract: The metabolic plasticity of shikimate and phenylpropanoid pathways redirects carbon flow to different sink products in order to protect sessile plants from environmental stresses. This study assessed the biochemical responses of two Azolla species, A. filiculoides and A. pinnata, to the combined effects of environmental and nutritional stresses experienced while growing outdoors under Australian summer conditions. These stresses triggered a more than 2-fold increase in the production of total phenols and their representatives, anthocyanins (up to 18-fold), flavonoids (up to 4.7-fold), and condensed tannins (up to 2.7-fold), which led to intense red coloration of the leaves. These changes were also associated with an increase in the concentration of carbohydrates and a decrease in concentrations of lipids and total proteins. Changes in lipid biosynthesis did not cause significant changes in concentrations of palmitoleic acid (C16:0), linolenic acid (C18:3), and linoleic acid (C18:2), the fatty acid signatures of Azolla species. However, a reduction in protein production triggered changes in biosynthesis of alanine, arginine, leucine, tyrosine, threonine, valine, and methionine amino acids. Stress-triggered changes in key nutritional components, phenolics, lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates could have a significant impact on the nutritional value of both Biology 2020, 9, 342; doi:10.3390/biology9100342 www.mdpi.com/journal/biology Biology 2020, 9, 342 2 of 15 Azolla species, which are widely used as a sustainable food supplement for livestock, poultry, and fish industries.},

	abstract = {Elevated ozone (O3) levels in the troposphere causes drastic and deleterious effects on crop plants. Rice is the most important staple food crop in the world. Hence, limitations on the agricultural expansion of rice is an actual threat to global food security. The rising concentration of ground-level O3, especially across the Asian rice bowl, directly interferes with the normal growth, physiology, and productivity of the crop. O3 pollution triggers the accumulation of toxic oxidative radicals and lowers the overall photosynthetic capacity. The stressed plants cannot produce enough metabolic equivalents to maintain ideal straw texture, flowering, and reproduction. This directly takes a toll on the quality of grains produced by the plants. The spikelet number, fertility, grain size, and nutrient levels in the grains produced per plant are overall decreased along with an increase in grain chalkiness. Earlier reports have shown that the concentrations of O3 will keep on rising with increasing air pollution and global warming. Thus, scientific strategists have included large-scale breeding to make use of the natural variation in the rice germplasm and create O3 tolerant varieties. Mapping experiments have isolated multiple quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with O3 tolerance. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have evaluated and verified that O3 tolerance in rice is mediated by multiple small effect loci which should be assimilated on a common genetic background by gene pyramiding or transgene stacking to generate a high yielding O3 tolerant cultivar. This chapter discusses the frontiers of advancements in the field of ozone stress in rice.},

Members of these families are induced in response to nitrate in the environment and are regulated by internal signals including nitrogen metabolites and shoot demand for nitrogen.

Analysis of mutants that are defective in nitrate reduction has shed light on the nature and number of genes required for the synthesis of the nitrate reductase holoenzyme. Physiological studies have revealed an intricate and complex regulatory system that controls the expression of the nitrate reductase gene in response to environmental signals such as nitrate, light and carbon dioxide. In this paper we review what is known about the properties of nitrate reductase and its regulation in angiosperms with special emphasis on Arabidopsis thaliana.},

	abstract = {1. NADPH-dependent nitrite reductase from the leaves of higher plants was purified at least 70-fold and separated into two enzyme fractions. The first enzyme, a diaphorase with ferredoxin-NADP-reductase activity, is required only to transfer electrons from NADPH to a suitable electron acceptor, which then donates electrons to nitrite reductase proper. 2. Purified nitrite reductase accepted electrons from ferredoxin (the natural donor) or from reduced dyes. Ferredoxin was reduced by illuminated chloroplasts or dithionite, or by NADPH when diaphorase was present. The purified enzyme did not accept electrons directly from NADPH. 3. Ferredoxins purified from maize, spinach or Clostridium were interchangeable in the nitrite-reductase system. 4. Nitrite reductase had K. 015IM for nitrite. The pH optimum varied with plant and method of assay. The preparation had low sulphite-reductase activity. Ammonia was the' product of nitrite reduction. 5. For some plants, the assay of crude preparations with NADPH was limited by diaphorase and the addition of diaphorase gave a better estimate of nitrite-reductase activity. A simple method of assay is described that uses dithionite with benzyl viologen as electron donor.},

Possible mechanisms regulating the activities of three enzymes involved in nitrate assimilation, nitrate reductase, nitrite reductase and glutamate dehydrogenase, were studied in radish cotyledons. 2. Nitrate-reductase and nitrite-reductase activities are low in nitrogen-deficient cotyledons, and are induced by their substrates. 3. Glutamate dehydrogenase is present regardless of the nitrogen status, and the enzyme can be increased only slightly by long-term growth on ammonia. 4. Although nitrate is the best inducer of nitrate reductase, lower levels of induction are also obtained with nitrite and ammonia. The experiments did not distinguish between direct or indirect induction by these two molecules. 5. Nitrite reductase is induced by nitrite and only indirectly by nitrate. 6. The induction of both nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase is prevented by the inhibitors actinomycin D, puromycin and cycloheximide, indicating a requirement for the synthesis of RNA and protein. 7. The decay of nitrate reductase, determined after inhibition of protein synthesis, is slower than the synthesis of the enzyme. Nitrite reductase is much more stable than nitrate reductase. 8. The synthesis of nitrate reductase is not repressed by ammonia, but is repressed by growth on a nitrite medium. 9. There is no inhibition of nitrate reductase, nitrite reductase or glutamate dehydrogenase by the normal end products of assimilation, but cyanate is a fairly specific inhibitor of nitrate reductase.},

	abstract = {In higher plants, cytosolic NAD(P)H-nitrate reductase (NR) is rapidly modulated by environmental conditions such as light, CO2, or oxygen availability. In leaves, NR is activated by photosynthesis, reaching an activation state of 60-80\%. In the dark, or after stomatal closure, leaf NR is inactivated down to 20 or 40\% of its maximum activity. In roots, hypoxia or anoxia activate NR, whereas high oxygen supply inactivates NR. Spinach leaf NR is inactivated by phosphorylation of serine 543 and subsequent Mg2+-dependent binding of 14-3-3 proteins at, or close to, this phosphorylation site. At least three different protein kinases (NR-PK) have been identified in spinach leaves that are able to phosphorylate NR on serine 543. Two of them show up as calmodulin-like domain protein kinases (CDPKs), and one as a SNF1-like protein kinase. Dephosphorylation of serine 543 is catalyzed by a Mg2+-dependent protein phosphatase and by a type 2A protein phosphatase (NR-PP), which is regulated by a trimer/dimer interconversion. The NR-PKs, NR-PPs, and 14-3-3s are present even in NR-depleted plant tissues. Artificial activation of NR in vivo is achieved by cellular acidification, by respiratory inhibitors, or by mannose feeding. As for anoxia, these treatments seem to act, at least in part, via cytosolic acidification, mediated by low cytosolic ATP levels. Activation is also achieved by ionophore-induced release of divalent cations from the cytosol. In addition, cytosolic AMP and phosphate esters seem to regulate NR-PK and NR-PP activities, thereby adapting NR activity within minutes to the changing environment.},

Strain T×11-8, bearing the chimeric Nia1 gene for NR under the control of the cabll-1 gene promoter, showed a constitutive NR which was inactive in ammonium-grown cells. In contrast to the wild-type, incubation of T×11-8 in ammonium media containing nitrate at micromolar concentrations resulted in reactivation of inactive NR and excretion of nitrite. In addition, negligible amounts of NT gene transcripts were induced by nitrate in this strain. However, NT transcripts from T×11-8 cells were induced in amounts similar to those in the wild-type, by preventing constitutive NR expression from the cabll-1 gene promoter in the dark. Strains lacking high-affinity NT and nitrite reductase activity and having the chimeric Niai gene have been constructed by genetic crosses. All these strains were sensitive to chlorate in ammonium-containing media and excreted nitrite when nitrate was present at millimolar concentrations. Spontaneous chlorate-resistant mutants isolated from these strains lacked constitutive NR activity though they constitutively expressed NR mRNA, The data strongly suggest that nitrate plays an important post-transcriptional regulatory role and that NR is involved in the regulation of the nitrate/ nitrite transport activities in C. reinhardtii.},

	abstract = {The regulation by light of nitrate reductase (NR) in higher plants is very complex. NR is firstly regulated by transcriptional control. In etiolated plants, phytochrome is the main photoreceptor involved and its low fluence response (LFR) is the common response mode. The effect of the very low fluence response (VLFR) has been reported for one of the isoforms in Arabidopsis thaliana, NIA2. The existence of a far-red light-mediated high irradiance response (HIR) has been demonstrated in phytochrome A over-expressing tobacco, confirming classical photophysiological experiments. For Lemna aequinoctialis, the existence of a red light-mediated high irradiance response has been assumed. In green plants, the effect of phytochrome on the level of NR protein is very modest, and the effect of light is mediated via photosynthesis, most probably through biochemical signals. The molecular basis of this switch from the action of phytochromes in etiolated tissue to effects of photosynthesis in green tissue is not known. The influence of light on NR is also regulated by fast post-translational modification. This mechanism is based on the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of a serine residue in the hinge 1 region of NR and the subsequent Mg2+/polyamine-dependent binding of the phosphorylated form to a 14-3-3 protein. Several kinases phosphorylate NR, and phosphatases not only act on NR but also dephosphorylate NR kinases. No influence of phytochrome is detectable. Instead, post-translational modification depends on the effect of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis may exert its effect on this process via biochemical products of photosynthesis (glucose, sugar phosphates), via substrates (nitrate, NADH) and/or by influencing Ca2+flux.},

In agreement with earlier results nitrate reductase (NR) activity was found only in plants treated with both light and NO(3) (-). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by transfer of the proteins to nitrocellulose paper and reaction with antibodies prepared against a pure NR showed that crude extracts prepared from light-grown plants had a polypeptide of approximately 116 kilodaltons (the subunit size for NR) when NO(3) (-) was present in the growth medium. Crude extracts from plants grown in the dark did not have the 116 kilodalton polypeptide, although smaller polypeptides, which reacted with NR-immunoglobulin G, were sometimes found at the gel front. When seedlings were grown on Kimpack paper or well washed sand, NR activity was again found only when the seedlings were exposed to light and NO(3) (-). Under these conditions, however, a protein of about 116 kilodaltons, which reacted with the NR antibody was present in light-grown plants whether NO(3) (-) was added to the system or not. The NR antibody cross-reacting protein was also seen in hydroponically grown plants when NH(4)Cl(-) was the only added form of nitrogen. These results indicate that the induction of an inactive NR-protein precursor in corn is mediated either by extremely low levels of NO(3) (-) or by some other unidentified factor, and that higher levels of NO(3) (-) are necessary for converting the inactive NR cross-reacting protein to a form of the enzyme capable of reducing NO(3) (-) to NO(2) (-).},

De novo synthesis of nitrite reductase occurred in the absence of an added nitrogen source, although enzyme activity was higher when the medium contained either NO3 − or NO2 −. The positive effect of NO3 − on nitrite reductase was also evident in tungstate-treated A. nidulans, which lacked an active nitrate reductase, indicating that the stimulatory effect was due to NO3 − itself and not to the NO2 − resulting from its intracellular reduction. NH4 + acted as a repressor, overriding any positive effect of NO3 − or NO2 −. Nitrite reductase synthesis was freed from NH4 + repression by l-methionine-DL-sulphoximine, an irreversible inhibitor of glutamine synthetase. NH4 + must therefore be metabolized through glutamine synthetase before repressing nitrite reductase. The kinetics of nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase development were similar in cells transferred from NH4 +- to NO3 −-containing media, suggesting a coordinate regulation of synthesis.},

	abstract = {Light stimulates de nova synthesis, as well as activation of higher plant nitrate reductase at the protein level. In green leaves, the light effects are mediated through photosynthetically active light by products of the Calvin cycle. A daily, light‐induced increase in nitrate reduclase (NR) mRNA. protein, and activity is observed in various higher plants. Glucose or sucrose can replace light in eliciting the increase in nitrate reductase mRNA accumulation, and sonic metabolite from nitrate assimilation exerts a negative feedback on transcription of the nitrate reductase genes. The positive feedforward induced by sugars, and the negative feedback from nitrogen compound(s) apparently result in the circadian rhythms of NR mRNA observed in various plants. Nitrate reductase shows hysteretic behaviour, converting between a low and a high activity form in response to NAD(P)H. The low activity form is inhibited by calcium/ magnesium, as opposed to the high activity form that is not inhibited. Examination of nitrate reductase activity in crude extracts made from plants before and after a light‐dark transition suggests the existence of two different forms of nitrate reductase: a‘light form’with a pH optimum of 7.8 in potassium phosphate buffer that is not inhibited by calcium or magnesium, and a “dark form’with li pH optimum of 7.5 that is strongly inhibited by calcium or magnesium. It is postulated that a transient lack of NADH as a result of decreased illumination can convert nitrate reductase into the less active form in situ. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

Since that time, the subject has been covered by Ashton \& Crafts (5) and Corbett (30), and in texts edited by Audus (8) and Kearney \& Kaufman (82). As in the last review (106), no attempt will be made to provide an all-inclusive coverage of the topic because of the limitations of space. Instead, consideration will be limited to effects imposed by herbicides on major pivotal metabolic systems at the cellular and molecular levels: chloroplast-associated reactions. mitochondrial- mediated responses, nucleic a·:::id metabolism and protein synthesis, and membrane interactions. In order to avoid voluminous reference citations, historical relationships and pdorities have been disregarded and, in some areas, only the most recent arfcCle in a series of papers or a review concerned with the same subject is cited.},

	abstract = {Staphylococcus epidermidis is a highly significant nosocomial pathogen mediating infections primarily associated with indwelling biomaterials (e.g., catheters and prostheses). In contrast to Staphylococcus aureus, virulence properties associated with S. epidermidis are few and biofilm formation is the defining virulence factor associated with disease, as demonstrated by animal models of biomaterial-related infections. However, other virulence factors, such as phenol-soluble modulins and poly-γ-DL-glutamic acid, have been recently recognized that thwart innate immune system mechanisms. Formation of S. epidermidis biofilm is typically considered a four-step process consisting of adherence, accumulation, maturation and dispersal. This article will discuss recent advances in the study of these four steps, including accumulation, which can be either polysaccharide or protein mediated. It is hypothesized that studies focused on understanding the biological function of each step in staphylococcal biofilm formation will yield new treatment modalities to treat these recalcitrant infections.},

The first compound introduced in the clinical practice was vancomycin, which still is widely used for the treatment of multidrug-resistant infections sustained by Gram-positive strains and also for the treatment of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, a life-threatening infection. In the last 20 years, several products, which are semisynthetic derivatives of the vancomycin core structure have reached the market, in particular, telavancin, oritavancin, and dalbavancin. In this review, we would like to highlight the chemical and biological properties of these drugs and compare their profile from a medicinal chemistry perspective.},

	abstract = {The microbiota of ripening cheese is dominated by lactic acid bacteria, which are either added as starters and adjunct cultures or originate from the production and processing environments (nonstarter or NSLAB). After curd formation and pressing, starters reach high numbers, but their viability then decreases due to lactose depletion, salt addition, and low pH and temperature. Starter autolysis releases cellular contents, including nutrients and enzymes, into the cheese matrix. During ripening, NSLAB may attain cell densities up to 8 log cfu per g after 3 to 9 mo. Depending on the species and strain, their metabolic activity may contribute to defects or inconsistency in cheese quality and to the development of typical cheese flavor. The availability of gene and genome sequences has enabled targeted detection of specific cheese microbes and their gene expression over the ripening period. Integrated systems biology is needed to combine the multiple perspectives of post-genomics technologies to elucidate the metabolic interactions among microorganisms. Future research should delve into the variation in cell physiology within the microbial populations, because spatial distribution within the cheese matrix will lead to microenvironments that could affect localized interactions of starters and NSLAB. Microbial community modeling can contribute to improving the efficiency and reduce the cost of food processes such as cheese ripening.},

	abstract = {The mechanism of chloramphenicol resistance in several multiple-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis strains has been studied and shown to be due to the presence of the enzyme, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. As with S. aureus , the inactivating enzyme in S. epidermidis appears to be the product of a structural gene on the chloramphenicol plasmid because resistance and enzyme activity are concurcurrently lost after growth in acridine orange or at elevated temperatures. The synthesis of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase in S. epidermidis has been compared with the function of a similar enzyme in chloramphenicol-resistant S. aureus with the conclusion that the kinetics of induction, products of the reaction, and general properties of the enzymes are identical. The chloramphenicol acetylating enzyme from S. epidermidis has been purified to a state of homogeneity and compared with the analogous purified S. aureus enzyme. Both purified preparations consist of native enzymes with molecular weights of 80,000, and evidence is presented that is consistent with their being made up of four identical subunits of 20,000 each. The two staphylococcal enzymes are identical with respect to p H optimum, apparent affinity ( K m ) for chloramphenicol, heat denaturation, and immunological reactivity, but they differ in electrophoretic mobility, chromatographic behavior, substrate specificity, and sensitivity to inhibition by mercuric ion.},

Trees were produced from the irradiated budwood and planted into the field in 1992. In 1995 a seedless mutant (USDA 1-62-122) was identified and subsequently propagated on multiple rootstocks for evaluation. Based upon horticultural performance of the USDA 1-62-122 trees a nd fruit quality characteristics, especially the absence of seeds, USDA 1-62-122 was released in 2009 as `US Early Pride'. Although `US Early Pride' has been found to he essentially identical to `Fallglo' with the exception of being seedless, detailed studies to document time of maturity and postharvest behavior had not been conducted prior to release. We harvested `US Early Pride' and `Fallglo' fruit at intervals from October through late November and standard fruit quality parameters (size, weight, rind color, total soluble solids, (Brix) and titratable acidity) were quantified for both scions. Data indicate that `US Early Pride' fruit are slightly smaller than `Fallglo'. `US Early Pride' and `Fallglo' fruit were both legally mature in early October and maintained acceptable quality on the tree at least until late November. Following harvest, the response to ethylene was similar in `US Early Pride' and `Fallglo'. Sugars and acids were fairly consistent in the two cultivars during storage at 10 degrees C for 3 weeks. Decay and other postharvest disorders did not develop in either cultivar during storage. Our results document that `US Early Pride' is equivalent to `Fallglo' in time of maturity, response to ethylene, and postharvest behavior.},

The foliar tissue analysis revealed that the rootstocks induced alteration in different biochemicals in the grafted vines. Compared to `Pusa Urvashi' grafted on itself, the grafted rootstock-derived plants exhibited improved physiological and nutrient status.

Savagnin rose clones and rootstock on vigor, yield, and fruit quality was determined in a replicated field trial froth 1999 to 2004. Savagnin clone 511 was infected with Grapevine leafroll-associated virus l (GLRaV-1), Grapevine virus A (GVA), Rupestris stem pitting-associated virus (RSPaV), vein mosaic, and vein necrosis (virus combination 1); clone 511A was infected with RSPaV, vein mosaic, and vein necrosis (virus combination 2); and clone 51113 was healthy. Overall, no significant interaction between infection status and rootstock genotype (Vitis rupestris, Kober 51313, or 16149 Couderc) on the viticultural performance of the three Savagnin rose clones was observed. These findings imply that there is no association between the vegetative and productive performance of scion material infected with virus combination 1 or 2 and susceptibility of Kober 51313, V. rupestris, and 161-49 Couderc to the Kober stem-grooving and rupestris stem-pitting syndromes, respectively. Nonetheless, virus combination I significantly reduced vigor (19 to 23\%) and yield (42 to 54\%) over six consecutive years, while virus combination 2 had no major impact on growth and production.

As the grape quality is closely linked to the soil water status, understanding the effects of rootstock and irrigation management on grapevine water relations is essential to optimize yield and quality. This study was carried out to investigate the effects of irrigation strategies and rootstocks on water relations and scion vigour of field-grown grapevines in Petrolina, Pernambuco state, Brazil. The cultivars used as scions are Moscato Canelli and Syrah, both grafted onto IAC 572 and 1103 Paulsen rootstocks. The following water treatments were used: deficit irrigation, with holding water after veraison; and partial root-zone drying, Supplying (100\% of crop evapotranspiration) of the water loss to only one side of the root system after fruit set, alternating the sides periodically (about 24 days). In general, all treatments had values of pre-dawn leaf water potential higher than -0.2 MPa, suggesting absence of water stress. The vine water status was more affected by rootstock type than irrigation strategies. Both cultivars grafted on IAC 572 had the highest values of midday leaf water potential and stem water potential, measured on non-transpiring leaves, which were bagged with both plastic sheet and aluminum foil at least I h before measurements. For both cultivars, the stomatal conductance (g(s)), transpiration (E) and leaf area index (LAI) were also more affected by roostsotck type than by irrigation strategies. The IAC 572 rootstock presented higher g(s), E and LAI than the 1103 Paulsen. Differences in vegetative vigor of the scion grafted onto IAC 572 rootstocks were related to its higher leaf specific hydraulic conductance and deeper root system as compared to the 1103 Paulsen, which increased the water-extraction capability, resulting in a better vine water status.},

Two field trials were carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of cyprodinil + fludioxonil, pyraclostrobin + metiram, fludioxonil and cyprodinil to prevent or reduce natural infections caused by such fungi. Rootstock and scion cuttings were soaked in fungicidal suspensions for 50 min prior to grafting. After callusing, the grafted cuttings were planted in two commercial field nurseries with and without a previous history of grapevine cultivation. After nine months in the nursery, the plants were uprooted and analysed for the incidence and severity of the wood fungi. Plants uprooted from the field without a previous history of grapevine cultivation were generally less strongly infected by wood fungi. Under this condition, only the mixture cyprodinil + fludioxonil simultaneously reduced the incidence of Cylindrocarpon and Botryosphaeriaceae fungi, as well as the severity of Cylindrocarpon infections. Treatments did not produce significant differences in the incidence and severity of P. viticola, and Pa. chlamydospora. For plants grown in the field with a grapevine history, all fungicides except cyprodinil significantly reduced the incidence and severity of Cylindrocarpon fungi. Also, the incidence and severity of Botryosphaeriaceae pathogens were significantly decreased both by cyprodinil + fludioxonil and by cyprodinil. No significant differences were noticed for P. viticola incidence and severity, and Pa. chlamydospora was not, detected again. These results suggest that the practice of soaking grapevine cuttings in selected fungicides prior to grafting significantly reduces Cylindrocarpon spp. and Botryosphaeriaceae infections, thus improving the quality of planting material.},

The aim was to investigate the impact of rootstocks on the inter-relationship of inorganic ions and organic acid anions in the skin and pulp of grapes and in resultant wine. Methods and Results: Vines were irrigated with water having electrical conductivities in the range 1.6-2.1 dS/m. Chloride, sodium, potassium, malic and tartaric acid concentrations were higher in almost all cases in skin than in pulp. Significant positive correlations existed between chloride and sodium concentrations in both pulp and skin. A significant negative linear regression existed between malic acid and both chloride and sodium concentrations in skin of Chardonnay berries. There were positive linear regressions in chloride concentration between berry (pulp and skin) and resultant wine chloride in both Chardonnay and Shiraz. Conclusion: The higher malic acid and lower chloride concentrations in skin of most grafted Chardonnay and Shiraz vines, and vice versa for own rooted vines, may indicate competition for similar transporter proteins involved in loading into skins. Alternatively, higher salt concentrations in skins may be associated with accelerated malic acid catabolism. Significance of the Study: Chloride-excluding rootstocks demonstrated advantages through reduced chloride (but not sodium) in pulp and skin of grape berries and in resultant wines. Where rootstocks reduced chloride concentrations in skin of grape berries, there is potential for higher malic acid in skin and in the resultant red wines.},

The study was conducted in a commercial vineyard of central Greece, in a factorial experiment during two growing seasons (2005-2006). Grape samples were obtained at commercial harvest. The deficit water supply decreased berry size but did not affect the skin/pulp weight ratio. Water limitation, especially pre-veraison, caused a substantial increase of skin anthocyanin concentration, and this effect was independent of water deficit-induced reductions in berry size and vine vigor. Among individual anthocyanins, malvidin-3-O-glucoside was mostly affected by water supply. The rootstock genotype did not affect berry growth parameters and skin polyphenol concentrations. The irrigation regime (mainly post-veraison) and rootstock genotype affected total flavan-3-ol monomers in seed tissue, mainly as a result of variations in the catechin amount. The lower seed phenolic concentration was found in non-irrigated and SO4-grafted vines, probably as a result of the restriction of scion vigor caused by these treatments, thereby altering cluster exposure. Skin and seed tannins were not affected by either rootstock or irrigation. The limited water supply was associated with increased aroma potential at harvest.},

In an attempt to develop GVA resistance, we made a GFP-tagged GVA-minireplicon and utilized it as a tool to consistently activate RNA silencing. Launching the GVA-minireplicon by agroinfiltration delivery resulted in a strong RNA silencing response. In light of this finding, we produced transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana plants expressing the GVA-minireplicon, which displayed phenotypes that could be attributed to reproducibly and consistently activate post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS). These included: (i) low accumulation of the minireplicon-derived transgene; (ii) low GFP expression that was increased upon agroinfiltration delivery of viral suppressors of silencing; and (iii) resistance against GVA infection, which was found in 60\%, and in 90-95\%, of T1 and T2 progenies, respectively. A grafting assay revealed that non-silenced scions exhibited GVA resistance when they were grafted onto silenced rootstocks, suggesting transmission of RNA silencing from silenced rootstocks to non-silenced scions. Despite being extremely resistant to GVA infection, the transgenic plants were susceptible to the closely related vitivirus, GVB. Furthermore, infection of the silenced plants with GVB or Potato virus Y (PVY) resulted in suppression of the GVA-specific defense. From these data we conclude that GVA-minireplicon-mediated RNA silencing provides an important and efficient approach for consistent activation of PTGS that can be used for controlling grapevine viruses. However, application of this strategy for virus resistance necessitates consideration of possible infection by other viruses.},

Comparisons between treated and untreated roots after different times of HR induction by IAA were realized by advanced custom DNA microarrays using `Riesling', a phylloxera-sensitive scion, as a control. IAA induction resulted in higher numbers of differentially expressed genes in `Borner' than in `Riesling'. In total, 27 putative HR-related genes were identified in `Borner'. These genes are presumably involved in the production of phytoalexins, ethylene-associated gene products, cell wall proteins and transcription factors.

	abstract = {In Citrus, the success of the scion largely depends upon the rootstock on which it has been grafted. `Troyer' citrange is an important rootstock used worldwide for high density planting. It is also one of the most promising rootstock for several Indian scion varieties such as `Nagpur' mandarin, `Kinnow' mandarin, grapefruits, acid lime, `Satsuma' sweet orange and `Mosambi' sweet orange. In addition, it has high resistance to tristeza virus, which causes Citrus decline, and has good adaptability for acidic soil. Commercial rootstock cultivars are commonly propagated by seeds. However, seeds of many Citrus varieties are moderately recalcitrant and also face loss of viability within a short period. The plants grown from seeds exhibit extended juvenility (4 to 10 years), thus making vegetative propagation and micropropagation a desirable method of propagation. The present study focuses on developing an efficient micropropagation protocol for the production of clonally uniform plants through axillary branching method of slow growing rootstock variety, `Troyer' citrange. Multiple shoots can be obtained from single nodes of field grown trees cultured on Murashige and Skoog's (MS; 1962) medium containing Benzylamino purine (BA; 1.11 mu M), Kinetin (Kn; 1.1625 mu M), and 3\% sucrose. A shoot multiplication fold of 3.86 every four weeks was achieved. Proliferated shoots were rooted on half strength MS medium with Naphthalene acetic acid (NAA; 0.5 mu M) and plantlets were transferred to a mixture of soil and agropeat. 100\% survival was observed during hardening of the rooted plantlets. The comparative analyses of the DNA fingerprinting profiles confirmed the genetic stability of the regenerated plantlets. The results of this study have enormous commercial application for the propagation of healthy disease-free Citrus rootstocks to meet the ever-growing demand for superior quality planting material.},

	abstract = {Simple sequence repeat (SSR) profiles were produced for 27 of the most common rootstocks in Italy. The varieties were chosen for practical purposes, as they are the most widely commercialized and provided the opportunity to have more than one clone or accession for each variety, apart from three. The plant material, a total of 86 samples, was primarily from the collections of CRA-VIT and the Nucleo di Premoltiplicazione delle Venezie. The use of reliable references, obtained froth the French collection of Le Grau du Roi, confirmed that in Italy 157-11C was often confused with 161-49C. Comparison of the rootstock alleles with those of 663 genotypes of V. vinifera L. showed that polymorphisms at the single loci differed in the two groups and that there were alleles specific to the rootstocks and absent in the V. vinifera varieties. These data could be very useful for identification of the probable genesis of hybrids of unknown origin.},

	abstract = {Florida's citrus industry is currently under severe onslaught from two non-indigenous but now endemic pathogens causing the diseases huanglongbing (HLB) and citrus canker. None of the commercial cultivars are resistant to either disease, which result in severe losses to the industry. Genetic transformation of citrus, to incorporate gene(s) for disease resistance not found in citrus, is gaining importance due to the possibility of incorporating resistance to these diseases. In an effort to transform a large number of cultivars via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, epicotyl explants of several citrus scion and rootstock cultivars were evaluated for their ability to incorporate transgenes into their genome. It was determined that genetic transformation efficiency depended on cultivar studied, and the cultivars were either relatively easy to transform, moderately difficult, or recalcitrant to Agrobacterium infection. In general, of the cultivars investigated, Carrizo and `Duncan' had the highest transformation efficiency (over 40\%), followed by `OLL8', a `Valencia' like somaclone, and `Hamlin' (20\% to 40\%). Poncirus trifoliata, `Marsh' and `Flame' grapefruit, and `Valencia' sweet orange were moderately difficult (10\% to 20\%), while `Mexican Lime', `Volkamer' lemon, Citrus macrophylla, and tangerines were recalcitrant (less than 10\%). Our results also suggested that final recovery rate of transgenic plants suitable for transfer to a greenhouse were significantly lower than the total transgenic plants obtained after transformation since the cultivars also varied in their ability to regenerate after in vitro grafting.},

Successful grafting requires the integration of the scion and rootstock vascular networks.

Using both xylem-mobile dyes and the xylem-limited bacterial pathogen Xylella fastidiosa, we demonstrate that the graft union contains open xylem conduits providing for passive pathogen movement.

Test vines consisted of scions grafted onto rootstocks that were healthy or infected by mild protective strains GFLV-GHu or Arabis mosaic Writs (ArMV)-Ta. Challenge GFLV infection via the nematode Xiphinema index was monitored over nine consecutive years in control and ArMV-Ta cross-protected vines by double-antibody sandwich-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using GFLV-specific antibodies, and in GFLV-GHu cross-protected vines by characterizing the coat protein gene of superinfecting isolates by immunocapture-reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Results were consistent with a significantly reduced challenge infection rate in cross-protected vines compared with control vines, more so in those protected with GFLV-GHu (19 versus 90\%) than with ArMV-Ta (40 versus 65\% in field A and 63 versus 90\% in field 13). However, the two mild strains significantly reduced fruit yield by 9\% (ArMV-Ta) and 17\% (GFLV-GHu) over 8 years and had a limited effect on fruit quality. Therefore, in spite of a great potential at reducing the incidence of challenge field isolates, cross-protection with natural mild protective strains GFLV-GHu and ArMV-Ta is not attractive to control GFLV because the negative impact on yield is a limiting factor for its deployment.},

Temperature patterns in the recent past indicate that both fall and midwinter are times when risk of bud damage from cold events is probable, making proper site selection and cultivar choice critical. Water is not used for frost protection in this climate, but wind machines have proven to be useful. In frost-prone sites, annual sucker growth with cane burying is practiced as an insurance strategy.

Cabernet-Sauvignon (Vitis vinifera L), subjected to three irrigation levels (FI: 100\% of evapotranspiration, DI: 50\% of evapotranspiration and NI: not irrigated). The experiment was conducted on 10-year-old vines, grown under the semi-arid conditions of central Greece. There was a significant depressive effect in water status (estimated by midday stem water potential, Psi(s)) and net assimilation rate (A) of Cabernet-Sauvignon with decreasing water supply, on both rootstocks. The down regulation of A was mainly due to decreases in stomatal conductance (g(s)). NI treatment showed significantly higher intrinsic water use efficiency (A/g(s)) and lower leaf carbon isotope discrimination (Delta) compared to irrigated treatments. Leaf area index (LAI) and pruning weight (PW) were found to be higher under FI treatment but this effect was more pronounced on the 1103P-grafted vines. Canopy growth was strongly controlled by rootstock, being significantly higher on 1103P, presumably due to its higher capacity to access soil water. Rootstock genotype affected scion water status via its effect on whole-vine transpiration. Cabernet-Sauvignon photosynthesis response to water status was not altered by rootstock. The only apparent difference between rootstocks was the higher A of SO4-grafted vines under NI treatment, associated with higher Psi(s). A/g(s) and Delta were only altered under FI treatment, with 1103P showing more efficient use of available soil water than SO4. Vines on SO4 had a lower specific leaf area (SLA) as a result of lower growth rate than 1103P,which possibly provided a supplemental mechanism to maintain leaf water status and gas exchange. Concluding, SO4 could be better adapted on fertile soils under non-limiting water supply due to its capacity to achieve a balanced vegetative and reproductive growth while 1103P, a more water efficient rootstock, would be better to grow in semi-arid regions where water limitation occurs.

One of the ways that the pathogen infects newly developing trees is by graft-transmission through infected scion wood. Submersion of pecan scion wood in 46 degrees C water for 30 min greatly reduced transmission of X. fastidiosa following grafting. During a 2-year study with potted rootstock grafted to either hot-water treated or nontreated scion wood collected from limbs of `Cape Fear' pecan infected with X. fastidiosa, the pathogen was detected in 21\% of the trees that developed from the nontreated scion wood and 0.7\% of the trees from the hot-water-treated scions. The hot-water treatment of 46 degrees C for 30 min did not affect graft success. Likewise, scion diameter had no effect on success of grafting or on the efficacy of hot-water treatment. Similar hot-water treatments have been efficacious in elimination of X. fastidiosa and some other pathogens from grapevine cuttings. The use of the hot-water treatment demonstrated in this report could be helpful to individual pecan growers and nurseries that use scion wood that may be infected with X. fastidiosa to reduce the occurrence of pecan bacterial leaf scorch disease in new trees.},

	abstract = {Aims: the present study was designed to test the hypothesis according to which rootstock effects on scion growth and yield are related to fundamental physiological traits which are expressed consistently and independently of environmental conditions. Methods and results: Pruning weights and yield components from two independent rootstock experiments are reported. In the first experiment, the effect of two levels (30 and 70 kgN/ha/year) was studied during 15 years on Cabernet-Sauvignon vines grafted onto SO4 and Riparia Gloire de Montpellier (RGM). In the second one, Cabernet-Sauvignon and Merlot vines grafted on SO4 and RGM were submitted to two levels of soil fertility shortly after plantation: control and high (100 kgN/ha/year + irrigation) and data from the plantation to year 6 were recorded. In both experiments, vine vigour and yield were significantly affected by rootstocks and fertilisation/irrigation treatments. No interaction was recorded. The devigorating effect of RGM in comparison to SO4 was observed in both experiments, regardless of other parameters. Cabernet-Sauvignon was more affected by rootstock than Merlot. Conclusion: Rootstock effects on vine vegetative and reproductive development were consistently expressed, indicating that scion-rootstock interactions are governed not only by adaptative, but also by specific physiological traits. Significance and impact of study: This work provides information on scion-rootstock interactions which may be useful in rootstock breeding programs and may help to better choose the rootstock according to the scion and the environment.},

The weights of the galls induced on non-grafted vines by two of six strains of Agrobacterium vitis and Agrobacterium tumefacience biovar 1 were significantly different. A. vitis strain AG57 and Agrobacterium tumefacience biovar 1 strain 16/6 induced significantly larger galls (8.9 and 5.4 mm respectively) on `Thompson seedless' and `Red Sahebi' when these were growing as self-rooted plants than when grafted on NAZ(4) and NAZ(6). Observations over a four-year period in the field showed that there was no difference in crown gall incidence until the second year. Scions grafted onto rootstocks of NAZ(4) and NAZ(6) had a 21.5\% and 6.8\%, incidence, compared to 55\% for self-rooted vines. In another field experiment with naturally infected scions of V. vinifera cv. `Asgari' (a very susceptible cultivar), crown gall was apparent on vines grafted onto all rootstocks after six years. The incidence of crown gall was 18\% on NAZ(6) compared to 68\% on NAZ(4). During a five-year period, many self-rooted vines died, compared to only a few scions grafted onto NAZ(4) and NAZ(6) rootstocks that died. At the end of the study, many pathogenic strains of Agrobacterium spp. were isolated from the roots of `Thompson seedless' and `Red Sahebi' vines, but not from roots or vines when NAZ(4) and NAZ(6) rootstocks were used.},

In Texas, the citrus industry is located in the far south of the state in a high pH and calcareous soils region, which makes sour orange the best rootstock option. The Texas industry has been under a threat since the arrival in Florida and Mexico of the most efficient vector of CTV, the Brown Citrus Aphid. In an attempt to find a suitable replacement for sour orange rootstock a field trial was performed to evaluate 10 rootstocks with Rio Red grapefruit scion. Trees on C35 and Carrizo citranges, and Swingle citrumelo became very chlorotic and died. The other rootstocks also showed slight to severe chlorosis but were able to recover. C22 outperformed all rootstocks during the 6 years, producing more than 1.5 times the yield of sour orange, and approximate to 2-fold the production of Goutou which was the rootstock with the lowest production. Although significantly lower than C22, the cumulative production of trees on C57 and C146 rootstocks were excellent and their yearly fruit productions were similar to that of C22 in four (2001, 2003, 2004, and 2005) out of the 6 years of study. All three rootstocks originated from the same cross (Sunki mandarin x Swingle trifoliate orange). In all years, sour orange rootstock yielded the highest percentage of soluble solids (SS) and Troyer and Goutou rootstocks the lowest. Although the SS varied with rootstocks, the ratio of the SS and the percentage of acid did not significantly vary with rootstock type. Considering that C22, C57, and C146 are tolerant to CTV and other important diseases, these rootstocks are good options to replace Sour orange in Texas.},

Earlier the growers and scientists in India used to refer to the 132-56 rootstock as `Dog ridge A' for the sake of differentiation. At certain locations the vines grafted on these rootstocks outperformed those grafted on Dog Ridge rootstock in the growers' vineyards particularly those that suffered from moisture stress and received saline irrigation. To know the potential of 132-56 for use under adverse situations like saline soils, the petiole samples of Tas-A-Ganesh from own rooted Vitis vinifera L. vines grafted on Dog Ridge (Vitis champini) and on 13256 rootstocks were analyzed for sodium and chloride concentrations over three years at six different stages of vine growth. The tissue age varied from one month to five months. The vines received saline irrigation through drip irrigation system. The studies indicated that the grafted vines accumulated significantly lower chlorides in the tissues than the own rooted vines. The own rooted vines exhibited leaf-burning symptoms. No significant differences were observed between the two rootstocks for chloride content at any stage of sampling. The vines raised on 132-56 rootstock accumulated significantly less sodium content than those raised on Dog Ridge and own rooted vines at all the stages and years of sampling. At two stages, the petioles from vines grafted on Dog Ridge rootstock had higher sodium content than own rooted. The vines grafted on Dog Ridge rootstock produced higher pruned biomass than the other two stock-scion combinations. The results indicated that Dog Ridge, the most preferred rootstock introduced by the growers for salinity and drought tolerance did not prevent Na from accumulating in the vines to a desirable level under saline irrigation. Further the 132-56 rootstock exhibited better exclusion for sodium than Dog Ridge.},

Ac-1 and Y interstocks moderately reduced the tree size without influencing yield efficiency (yield per unit of crown area). In contrast, Ac-2 and D. rhombifolia interstocks reduced both tree size and fruit yield (kg/tree), and many of these trees died within a few years after planting. Annual fluctuations and no consistent trends were observed in the fruit weight among control and interstock trees.

Methods and results: The vines were subjected to a progressive water stress in greenhouse controlled conditions. At the end of the water stress treatments, physiological analyses were carried out (stem water potential, dry matter production, soluble sugars, proline as well as ions Na+ and K+). Drought was expressed by the drop of the stem water potential in the stressed vines as compared to their controls. Furthermore, tolerance and sensitivity were linked to the accumulation of soluble sugars and proline as well as the equilibrium of K+ and Na+ in the leaves. Conclusion: When ungrafted, Cardinal was more: tolerant to water stress than Superior Seedless. The grafted vines exhibited more vigour, moreover, the combination of Cardinal with SO4 and Superior Seedless with 110R revealed to be the advantageous associations under water stress. Significance and impact of study: This work has been carried out to investigate the differential responses of grapevine cultivars to drought stress and the impact of grafting under water shortage conditions.},

	abstract = {The potential impact of transgenic plums and grapevines expressing viral coat protein (CP) gene constructs on the diversity and dynamics of virus populations was assessed under open and confined conditions in the frame of a research program sponsored by the European Commission. Across all field trials conducted in different locations (France, Romania, and Spain) and environments (continental and Mediterranean), transgenic plums expressing the CP gene of Plum pox virus (PPV) and transgenic grapevines expressing the CP gene of Grapevine Janleaf virus (GFLV) had no detectable effect on the emergence of recombinant PPV and GFLV species over eight-ten and three years, respectively. Also, no statistically significant difference was found in the number and type of aphids, including viruliferous individuals, and other arthropods that visited transgenic and nontransgenic plum trees. In addition, Apple chlorotic leaf spot virus, Prune dwarf virus, and Prunus necrotic ringspot virus did not influence the stability of the engineered resistance to PPV in co-infected transgenic plums over three dormancy periods. Further, under confined conditions, no recombinant virus was found to detectable level in transgenic grapevines expressing the CP gene of Grapevine virus A (GVA) or Grapevine virus B (GVB) that were challenged with the homologous or heterologous virus, despite high accumulation of transgene transcripts. Also, translocation of transgene-derived products, i.e. protein, mRNAs and siRNAs, did not occur to detectable level from transgenic grapevine rootstocks expressing the GFLV CP gene to nontransgenic scions. Altogether, our transgenic plums and grapevines expressing viral genes had a neutral impact on virus populations and non-target organisms over extended time. These findings provide new insights into the environmental impact of transgenic perennial crops engineered for virus resistance. It is expected that they will assist national and international regulatory authorities in making scientifically based decisions for the release of virus-resistant transgenic crops.},

In order to better understand the influence of scion/rootstock combination on water use and drought resistance some water status characteristics were studied on grapevine vines grafted on different rootstocks. Old local grapevine variety Vitis vinifera `Rebula' or `Ribolla gialla' was grafted on eight rootstocks (196/17 Castel, 1103 Paulsen, 3309 Couderc, SO4, VI M, V M, Borner, 420 A, Rebula 6/28). Biometric characteristics (geometry, dry and fresh weight) and the root hydraulic conductivity (RHC) were measured during the trial. Midday stem water potential (SWP) was measured five times with a Scholander type pressure chamber. 3309 Couderc revealed to be water stress sensitive as reported in literature, while 1103 Paulsen which is described as high drought resistant did not match the expectations. After recovery some of the rootstocks showed an increase in root hydraulic conductivity, higher than in unstressed grapevines, thus suggesting that it is possible that the degree of suberisation could account for the differences in water transport through roots.},

	abstract = {Methods to manage uncontrolled flow of transgenes via pollen and seeds are increasing in importance as transgenic crops become more commonplace. In many parts of the world, grapevine scions are grafted onto rootstocks, which are adapted to resist adverse soil conditions and pests and/or to promote vigor. Water, minerals and other important nutrients are transferred in bulk from the rootstock to scion via the xylem. Thus, it is possible that bioactive peptides produced by a transgenic rootstock and deposited into its xylem sap would be similarly transferred to a non-transgenic scion. If the peptide conferred a desirable trait to the non-transgenic scion, such as disease resistance, the issue of unwanted gene flow would be solved, since transgenic pollen and seeds would not be produced during flowering and fruit production. Furthermore, the commercialization of transgenic grapevines would be simplified, since relatively few transgenic rootstock varieties would be needed to protect any non-transgenic scion. As an example, transgenic rootstock technology might be used in the control of Pierce's disease (PD), which is caused by the xylem-limited bacteria, Xylella fastidiosa. Antimicrobial peptides produced by a transgenic rootstock may control bacteria in the xylem sap of a non-transgenic scion, thus providing PD resistance. To test this hypothesis, transgenic Vitis vinifera `Thompson Seedless' expressing the Shiva-1 lytic peptide gene was treated as a rootstock. Non-transgenic V. vinifera `Cabernet Sauvignon' and `Thompson Seedless' were grafted onto the rootstock. Controls consisted of grafted and non-grafted transgenic and non-transgenic vines. Presence of the Shiva-1 peptide in xylem sap of the scion was detected by EnzymeLinked Immunoabsorbent Assay (ELISA).},

	abstract = {Yeast cells have a minimum N requirement to ferment a must through to dryness, so that grape N content (hence must N) becomes critical in meeting that prerequisite. Viticultural practices aimed at meeting that N requirement are of special relevance because interactions between rootstock and vineyard nitrogen supply strongly influence scion mineral nutrient status as well as shoot vigour, and via those processes, fruit composition. Such outcomes were investigated in a field trial involving Shiraz on three rootstocks viz. Teleki 5C, Schwarzmann and Ramsey. Five N supply regimes, varying from 0 to 80 kg/(ha.season),were imposed through a drip-irrigation system during two periods (either flowering to veraison, or post-harvest to leaf-fall, or both) over three successive growing seasons. Post-harvest N supply increased scion leaf N and nitrate N concentrations at flowering for vines on Teleki 5C and Schwarzmann. By veraison, N recently applied in the flowering to veraison period elevated these indicators of N status in all vines on all rootstocks. Grape yields from vines on Teleki 5C and Schwarzmann were elevated by N supply after harvest, whereas juice soluble solids levels were lowered. Free amino acids in Shiraz juice were dominated by non-assimilable N, amounting to about 50\% or more of the total free amino-N in the juice. Increasing N supply increased free amino acid concentrations in the juice of berries from vines on all rootstocks, but only vines on Schwarzmann derived any benefit from N supplied after harvest. The highest concentrations of free amino acids were measured in the berries from vines on Schwarzmann receiving 80 kg N/(ha.season). Of immediate practical relevance for N management of Shiraz grapevines on either Teleki 5C or Ramsey rootstocks, the minimum value for assimilable free amino-N concentration required to ferment a must through to dryness was not achieved if vineyard N application was limited to the post-harvest period.},

Top-working is the process of changing the top of an established vine from one cultivar to another in one year, by budding or grafting.

The top-working was performed by skilled workers on a mature vineyard of the Istituto Agrario di San Michele a/Adige with scion and bud of `Chardonnay' clone 95. Three treatments were imposed on `Cabernet Sauvignon' clone R5 grafted on 101-14 Mgt rootstock, and on `Syrah' clone 100 and `Merlot' clone 181 both grafted on 3309 C rootstock. The sprouting yield of grafting type x interstock interaction of two-way ANOVA was significant and Chip-bud/interstocks resulted significantly higher than T-bud and W-green/interstocks with a mean per treatment of 92.0\%, 85.9\% and 78.6\% respectively. Fertility, production, bunch weight, soluble solid, titratable acidity and pH for the three treatments at harvest were not significantly different.

In general, repeated soak-treatments of propagation material in the tested products resulted in reduced pathogen incidences in nursery grapevines. However, products containing T. harzianum (Tricho flow-T), hydrogen peroxide (Bio-sterilizer) and 8-hydroxyquinoline sulphate (Chinosol) gave inconsistent results, whereas Bronocide (a blend of halogenated alcohols and water) proved to be a good sterilising agent, but reduced certifiable plant yield significantly.

Little is known about the disease cycle of this fungus. Infected propagation material was identified as a major means of dissemination of the pathogen. Recently, the pathogen was also detected from soil in South Africa and airborne conidia have been found in vineyards. The aim of this study was to use a molecular detection technique to test different samples collected from nurseries in South Africa at different nursery stages for the presence of P. chlamydospora. A one-tube nested-PCR technique was optimised for detecting P. chlamydospora in DNA extracted from soil, water, callusing medium and grapevine wood. The one-tube nested-PCR was sensitive enough to detect as little as 1 fg of P. chlamydospora genomic DNA from water and 10 fg from wood, callusing medium and soil. PCR analyses of the different nursery samples revealed the presence of several putative 360 bp P. chlamydospora specific bands. Subsequent sequence analyses and/or restriction enzyme digestions of all 360 bp PCR bands confirmed that all bands were P. chlamydospora specific, except for five bands obtained from callusing media and one from water. Phaeomoniella chlamydospora was positively detected in 25\% of rootstock cane sections collected from mother blocks, 42\% of rootstock cuttings and 16\% of scion cuttings collected during grafting, 40\% of water samples collected after pre-storage hydration, 67\% of water samples collected during grafting, 8\% of callusing medium samples and 17\% of soil samples collected from mother blocks. These media can therefore be considered as possible inoculum sources of the pathogen during the nursery stages.},

The cut grafting surfaces of both the scion and rootstock were first dipped into either 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), indole-3-butryic acid (IBA), benzyladenine (BA), or kinetin (Ki) for 20 s. NAA and IBA were applied at concentrations of 500, 1000, and 2000 mg/litre and BA and Ki were applied at rates of 250 500. and 1000 mg/litre. Following this treatment the cuttings were grafted, stratified, and hardened. Control group cuttings were grafted without any application. Results showed that the physiological effects of cytokinins differed from auxins. In general. Ki and BA stimulated rapid proliferation of callus between the scion and rootstock whereas NAA and IBA increased root formation at the basal end of grafted cuttings compared with the control. The best results were obtained from treating the raft cut-surfaces of graft combinations with 250 and 500 ma/litre Ki or BA. Except for the 1000 mg/litre concentrations, Ki and BA showed better callusing rate and callusing degree at grafting point of all tested graft combinations compared with the control, whereas rooting rate and rooting degree were enhanced by application of IBA and NAA compared with the control. In all graft combinations, the highest success rate (100\%) was obtained from 250 mg/litre Ki application. Significant increases in success rate and callus formation as callusing rate and callusing degree at the grafting zone indicated that the Ki and BA may have the potential to improve graft union formation.},

	abstract = {Grapevine Rupestris stem pitting-associated virus (GRSPaV) is a member of the genus Foveavirus within the family Flexiviridae. GRSPaV is closely associated with the disease Rupestris stem pitting and is frequently detected in grapevines worldwide. Previous research in several laboratories suggests that GRSPaV consists of a family of sequence variants. However, the genetic composition of GRSPaV variants in viral isolates from scion and rootstock varieties has not been studied extensively. In this report, the genetic diversity and population structure of GRSPaV isolates from scion and rootstock varieties were analysed using two pairs of primers targeting two different genomic regions encoding the helicase domain of the replicase and the capsid protein. In total, 190 cDNA clones derived from 24 isolates were sequenced and analysed. At least four major groups of GRSPaV variants were found to exist in grapevines. Interestingly, the majority of the scion varieties (9/10) that were analysed, regardless of their genetic background and geographical origin, harboured complex viral populations composed of two to four distinct viral variants. In contrast, the viral populations in isolates from rootstock varieties were homogeneous and comprised a single variant. The practice of grafting between scion and rootstock varieties commonly used in modern viticulture, coupled with the frequent regional and international exchange of propagating materials, may have played a major role in the ubiquitous distribution and mixed infections of distinct GRSPaV variants among scion varieties. The possible origin and evolution of GRSPaV are also discussed.},

Factors were grafting method, three grape (Vitis vinifera L.) cultivars ('Chardonnay', `Cabernet Sauvignon' and `Teroldego'), and two rootstocks (Paulsen and Kober 5 BB). Green-grafted plants showed a significantly higher percentage of root establishment, and lower diameters for scion, graft union and rootstock. Woody-grafted vines had higher chlorophyll and carotenoids concentrations, greener leaves, and greater dry matter production than green-grafted ones. Net photosynthesis, soluble proteins content, and nutritional status did not change in relation to the different grafting methods after the second year. Glucose and fructose concentrations were higher and plant components were better balanced when green-grafting was used. This method produced better vascular formation than woody-grafting, suggesting more effective transport of substances between stock and scion.},

The trial was located within a commercial vineyard on a sandy loam soil, and represented a typical replant situation. Grapevine performance was assessed over five seasons, viz. 1999-2004 inclusive, in terms of yield per vine, berry weight, juice composition and vigour (based on trunk girth). The highest yielding rootstock over the trial period was 1103 Paulsen (28.9 kg/vine) followed by 140 Ruggeri and Ramsey (26.1 and 25.8 kg/vine respectively), S04 (22.5 kg/vine), Schwarzmann, 101-14 and Teleki 5A (19.9, 18.7 and 18.4 kg/vine respectively). Scions on their own roots returned lowest yield (15.5 kg/vine). Berry weights were largest for the three high yielding rootstocks (2.3 g) and smallest with own roots (2.0 g). Total soluble sugars in harvested fruit were largely unaffected by rootstock in most seasons, although taken over all seasons, fruit from scions grafted onto Ramsey rootstock had the lowest levels, while Teleki 5A had the highest levels (viz. 23.4 degrees Brix and 24.7 degrees Brix respectively). Comparative vigour for all seven graft combinations was inferred from trunk circumference. There was a 2-fold difference in rootstock girth below the graft union (viz. 265 nun for 1103 Paulsen, compared to 135 mm for S04), whereas differences in the scion girth above the graft union were minor (only 16\%). Relative compatibility of scion and stock was inferred from `girth ratio' of trunk circumference above compared with below the graft union. Girth ratio was highest for Sunmuscat scions grafted onto S04 rootstock, and lowest for scions on 1103 Paulsen. Scion girth and vine yield were broadly correlated.},

	abstract = {Grapevines are grown either on their own roots or on rootstocks that represent a mixture of grapevine species and hybrids. Developmental and physiological factors other than phylloxera resistance, lime tolerance, and ease of propagation were not directly considered during rootstock breeding, including rooting patterns. Here, in a comprehensive literature synthesis, we have compiled information concerning rooting depth distributions of grapevine roots from wall profile studies comprising a broad range of soil environments and rootstock genotypes. We considered the distributions based on the asymptotic equation of Y = (1 - beta(d)), where d = soil depth (cm) and Y = the proportion of roots from the surface to depth d. The median value of beta for the root distributions analyzed was 0.9826 and the standard deviation over all observations was 0.0068 (n = 240); most profiles had fitted values of beta generally greater than 0.975. This value places the depth distribution of grapevine roots in the vadose zone among the deepest observed for plants worldwide. The data suggested that soil properties such as the presence of soil profiles impermeable to root penetration, stoniness, and presence of gravel lenses have a greater influence on depth distributions than does genotype, even in deep fertile soils. Genotypic differences were not apparent, although the rootstock O39-16 (beta = 0.9867 +/- 0.0009, mean +/- se, n = 11), with a reputation for deep-rooting behavior, did exhibit deeper root distributions. The analysis also suggests that root characteristics other than root horizontal and vertical spread may need to be considered in order to explain some key rootstock characteristics like scion vigor or drought tolerance.},

Potassium content was found to be highest in the petioles of the cutting. Sodium and chloride contents were found to be the lowest in the petioles of the scion grafted onto `St. George' the first week of February.

	abstract = {Shiraz and Chardonnay grapevines that had been initially assessed for Cl- exclusion in the 1996 and 1997 harvest seasons at both Merbein (inland region of Victoria) and at Padthaway (sub-coastal region of South Australia), were re-evaluated in 2003 and 2004 at those same two locations. Both scion varieties were grown either on their own roots or were grafted to one of the following rootstocks: Ramsey, 1103 Paulsen, 140 Ruggeri, K51-40, Schwarzmann, 101-14, Rupestris St George and 1202 Couderc. Both sites had been irrigated with saline water since 1994. The salinity of irrigation water at Merbein was approximately 2.1 dS/m; at Padthaway irrigation salinity varied between approximately 1.6 dS/m and 2.5 dS/m during the survey period. Changes in the Cl–excluding ability of all rootstock/scion combinations between 1996, 1997 and 2003, 2004 were based upon analysis of Cl- concentrations in grape juice and in laminae at harvest, as well as Electrical Conductivity (EC), pH and Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR) of the 1:5 soil:water extract. Taking juice Cl- as indicative of rootstock effectiveness for Cl- exclusion, and considering data from Merbein, our analyses demonstrated that overall means for Shiraz juice Clincreased from around 190 to 427 mg/L over the survey period (7 years). In Chardonnay grapevines at Merbein, overall mean concentrations of Cl- in juice increased from around 70 to around 22 5 mg/L over 7 years. Significant differences between rootstocks were evident, with some rootstocks at Merbein showing a diminished capacity for Cl- exclusion in 2003 and 2004. By contrast, in Padthaway there was no consistent deterioration in Cl–excluding capacity by rootstocks supporting either Shiraz or Chardormay as scions. In 2004 there were significant differences between grapevines at Merbein and Padthaway in the concentration of Cl- accumulated, even though the mean soil EC1:5 after harvest for 0-90 cm depth was the same at both sites, namely 0.4 dS/m. Containment of grapevine salinity at Padthaway (relative to Merbein) between 1996/97 and 2003/04 was most likely due to factors such as a lower volume of saline irrigation, double the rainfall and 27\% lower pan evaporation.},

One way to improve vineyard water use efficiency is to improve transpiration efficiency, and judicious use of scion-rootstock combination can play a role. Accordingly, this paper examines the influence of rootstocks on the water use physiology of a common scion variety (Shiraz) and assesses the importance of variation in xylem sap abscisic acid (ABA) as an indicator of relative water use efficiency of different scion-rootstock combinations. Shiraz scions (clone BVRC12) grafted to seven rootstock varieties (along with an ungrafted control), were observed over two consecutive seasons in a field trial located in Adelaide, South Australia. Those two seasons (2001/02 and 2002/03) offered sharp contrasts with respect to soil and atmospheric water stress. Rootstock genotype had a significant impact on scion gas exchange, water status, canopy growth and yield in both seasons. Those impacts were associated with an inverse relationship between xylem sap ABA and stomatal conductance. We suggest that strategic analysis of xylem sap ABA may provide a marker for comparative water-use physiology of different stock-scion combinations, while recognising that irrigation pre-history, and associated degree of vine water stress, will be a further source of variation in grapevine water use.},

The two rootstocks and two scions were grafted in all four possible combinations along with two control grafts (virus-free scion on virus-free rootstock). A modified MS Murashige and Skoog (1962) tissue culture medium supplemented with 0.5 mg 1(-1) 6-benzylaminopurine was sufficient to induce multiple shoots. Shoots and micrografts readily produced roots in the basal medium. Micrografting gave an overall success rate of 77.8\%, with no significant difference between LN 33 rootstock and Cabernet sauvignon. When leafroll infected scion material was micrografted on to virus-free rootstock, the rootstock leaf turned red (23.5\% in LN 33 and 63.9\% in Cabernet sauvignon) or it showed leafrolling (28.5\%, no significant difference between LN 33 and Cabernet sauvignon) within 2-3 weeks. After 12 weeks in culture, the extent of viral symptoms in the micrografted material was high (81.3\%), with no significant difference between LN 33 and Cabernet sauvignon; however, the expression of symptoms was more severe on Cabernet sauvignon than on LN 33 rootstock.

Xylella fastidiosa, the causal agent of Pierce's disease (PD) in grapevines, has genes that encode cell-wall-clegrading enzymes, including a putative PG. Therefore, we hypothesized that PGIP expression could confer tolerance against this bacterium as well as against the fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. To test this hypothesis, Vitis vinifera cvs.'Thompson Seedless' and `Chardonnay' were transformed to express pear fruit PGIP-encoding gene (pPGIP) under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter. Substantial pear PGIP (pPGlP) activity was found in, crude extracts from leaves and in xylem exudate of transgenic lines obtained from independent transformation events, but not in untransformed controls. pPGlP activity was detected in xylem exudate of untransformed scions grafted on to transgenic' rootstocks expressing pPGIP. Leaves of transgenic plants infected with B. cinerea had reduced rates of lesion expansion. The development of PD was delayed in some transgenic lines with increased pPGlP activity.

	abstract = {Level of affinity between grapevine rootstock and Vitis vinifera as scion, quality of reproductive materials and technological actions in grapevine rootstock production process determine success in grapevine rootstock production in large extent. Practical training showed that difference in level of compatibility between grapevine rootstock and grafted Vitis vinifera cultivars are existing. Direct effects of these differences are unequal yield of first class grafted grapevine rootlings. In this paper, level of compatibility in nursery between clones of cv. Chardonnay BCL 75, VCR4 and cv. Merlot R18, MCL 519 and grapevine rootstocks Kober 5BB (Vitis berlandieri x V. riparia), SO4 (V. berlandieri x V. riparia) and 41B (Chasselas x V. berlandieri) were investigated. The trial was conducted in commercial grapevine nursery located in Velika Drenova, Serbia. As an index of compatibility, grade of high quality grapevine grafted rootlings, dry matter in mature shoots and root system development were used. Grafting was done by `tongue grafting' indoor technique. Stratification was done in sand, on temperature of the stratification material of 26-28 degrees C, and humidity of around 90\%. Grafted cuttings were waxed twice: before stratifi cation, and before planting in the nursery. Grafted rootlings were classed in two classes according to regulations of quality, (Yugoslav Official Register, 26/79). Grafted rootlings that did not satisfied standard criteria were discarded. Both clones of cv. Chardonnay gave the highest percentage of I class grafted rootlings on grapevine rootstock 41B: clone BCL 75 -60\% and clone VCR4 - 61\%. In the same combination, those grapevine grafted rootlings had the highest weight of the root system. Lower percentage of obtained I class grafted rootlings was established on rootstock Kober 5BB, while statistically significantly lower yields were obtained on grapevine rootstock SO4: clone BCL75 - 43\% and clone VCR4 - 48\%. Dry matter content in mature shoots is showing good maturity of shoots in cv. Chardonnay in all experiment combinations and varies from 53\% up to 54\%. Clones of Merlot, in this investigation, showed the highest level of compatibility with rootstock Kober 5BB. Percentage of I class grafted rootlings on this rootstock for clone R18 was 66\%, and for clone MCL 519 was 62\%. In the same experiment combination the highest root weight was established as well. The low degree of grafting compatibility was obtained by grafting Merlot clones on rootstock SO4, that is shown by significantly lower percentage of produced I class grafted rootlings in relation to obtained values by grafting on other examined grapevine rootstocks (clone R18/SO4 - 51\%; clone MCL519/SO4 - 50\%).},

	abstract = {This review discusses the impacts of nitrogen addition in the vineyard and winery, and establishes the effects that nitrogen has on grape berry and wine composition and the sensory attributes of wine. Nitrogen is the most abundant soil-derived macronutrient in a grapevine, and plays a major role in many of the biological functions and processes of both grapevine and fermentative microorganisms. Manipulation of grapevine nitrogen nutrition has the potential to influence quality components in the grape and, ultimately, the wine. In addition, fermentation kinetics and formation of flavour-active metabolites are also affected by the nitrogen status of the must, which can be further manipulated by addition of nitrogen in the winery. The only consistent effect of nitrogen application in the vineyard on grape berry quality components is an increase in the concentration of the major nitrogenous compounds, such as total nitrogen, total amino acids, arginine, proline and ammonium, and consequently (y) under bar east-(a) under bar ssimilable (n) under bar itrogen (YAN). Both the form and amount of YAN have significant implications for wine quality. Low must YAN leads to low yeast populations and poor fermentation vigour, increased risk of sluggish/stuck/slow fermentations, increased production of undesirable thiols (e.g. hydrogen sulfide) and higher alcohols, and low production of esters and long chain volatile fatty acids. High must YAN leads to increased biomass and higher maximum heat output due to greater fermentation vigour, and increased formation of ethyl acetate, acetic acid and volatile acidity. Increased concentrations of haze-causing proteins, urea and ethyl carbamate and biogenic amines are also associated with high YAN musts. The risk of microbial instability, potential taint from Botrytis-infected fruit and possibly atypical ageing character is also increased. Intermediate must YAN favours the best balance between desirable and undesirable chemical and sensory wine attributes. `Macro tuning', of berry nitrogen status can be achieved in the vineyard, given genetic constraints, but the final `micro tuning' can be more readily achieved in the winery by the use of nitrogen supplements, such as diammonium phosphate (DAP) and the choice of fermentation conditions. This point highlights the need to monitor nitrogen not only in the vineyard but also in the must immediately before fermentation, so that appropriate additions can be made when required. Overall, optimisation of vineyard and fermentation nitrogen can contribute to quality factors in wine and hence affect its value. However, a better understanding of the effect of nitrogen on grape secondary metabolites and different types of nitrogen sources on yeast flavour metabolism and wine sensory properties is still required.},

	abstract = {The effect of rootstock on seasonal vine nutrition was monitored at three trials in Northern California: two in the Sacramento Delta with Chardormay and Cabernet Sauvignon as the scions and one in Amador County with Zinfandel as the scion. Each site was planted with identical sets of 14 rootstocks. Leaf petioles were sampled at the three phenological stages of bloom, veraison, and harvest and analyzed for potassium (K) content. Rootstocks differed significantly in petiole K concentration at bloom, 44-53 had the highest K status at all three phenological sampling times, and Freedom also had high K status. Total K levels generally declined significantly between bloom and harvest for all varieties, although the amount and pattern of decline differed among rootstocks. Leaf lamina K concentrations were much lower than those of petioles. The ranges between the high and low values were much narrower, but trends were consistent with petiole samples. Rootstocks with Vitis berlandieri genetic backgrounds contained lower levels of petiole K at bloom, but these differences were not apparent at veraison and harvest. It is possible that water deprivation because of drip-irrigation or deficit-irrigation practices contributed to this result, as it has not been consistently observed in previous investigations.},

	abstract = {One of the major environmental safety issues over transgenic crops containing virus-derived genes relates to the outcome of recombination events between viral transgene transcripts and RNAs from indigenous virus populations. We addressed this issue by assessing the emergence of viable Grapevine fanleaf virus (GFLV) recombinants in transgenic grapevines expressing the GFLV coat protein (CP) gene. Test plants consisted of nontransgenic scions grafted onto transgenic and nontransgenic rootstocks that were exposed over 3 years to nematode-mediated GFLV infection in two distinct vineyard sites. The CP gene of challenging GFLV isolates was amplified from scions by IC-RT-PCR, and characterized by RFLP and nucleotide sequencing using strain F13 as reference since it provided the CP transgene. Analysis of EcoRI and StyI RFLP banding patterns from 347 challenging GFLV isolates and sequence data from 85 variants revealed no characteristics similar to strain F13 and no difference in the molecular variability among isolates from 190 transgenic and 157 nontransgenic plants, or from plants within (253 individuals) or outside (94 individuals) of the two sites. Interestingly, five GFLV recombinants were identified in three nontransgenic plants located outside of the two field settings. This survey indicates that transgenic grapevines did not assist the emergence of viable GFLV recombinants to detectable levels nor did they affect the molecular diversity of indigenous GFLV populations during the trial period. This is the first report on safety assessment of recombination with a transgenic crop expressing a CP gene under field conditions of heavy disease pressure but low, if any, selection pressure against recombinant viruses.},

After exposure to NaCl stress, the osmotin gene expression level was investigated in 6 grape cultivars grown in GAP (Southeast Anatolian region including the provinces Gaziantep, Sanliurfa, Diyarbakir, Mardin, Batman, Siirt and Sirnak) and in 4 grape cultivars and 7 rootstocks recommended to the GAP region. Expression levels were investigated by Northern blot analysis. The osmotin expression level was higher in scion cultivars than in rootstocks. Within grapevine cultivars, the highest osmotin gene expression level was observed in cv. Tahannebi, followed by Honusu, another GAP region cultivar. The osmotin gene expression levels of two grape cultivars, Ata sarisi and Alphonse Lavallee recommended to the GAP region, were lower than those of Honusu. On the other hand the GAP region cultivars Ag Besni, Rumi, Kabarcik, Dimiski and the recommended cultivars Razaki and Italia were significantly different in their expression levels. Among rootstocks 1616 C displayed the highest expression level, followed by 99R; they were followed by 1613C. In 110R the expression level was slightly lower than in the above mentioned ones and 41B.

However, these attributes were at par with Thompson Seedless grafted on Dogridge and Tas-A-Ganesh on own root. The interaction effects between rootstocks and varieties had significant influence in respect of pruning weight, girth of scion and stock. It indicated that Tas-A-Ganesh or Thompson Seedless grafted on Dogridge found better for vine vigour, stionic combination, yield and quality characters as compared to the rest of rootstocks.

The objective was to evaluate the rootstock and cultivar effects on plant leaf gas exchanges near the end of the growing season (September 4(th)),to get better acquainted on the causes of dwarfing effects of low-vigour rootstocks. The `Summit' cultivar had the highest net CO2 assimilation, stomatal conductance and transpiration rate, but its intrinsic water use efficiency was lower than that of the others. As for the rootstocks, two distinct groups could be identified (Pav-Mxm-Cab and Gsl-Edb), the first one being the most active. The interactions Bur*Pav and Sum*Pav were the most active in the first week of September, and the lowest CO2 assimilation rates were observed on the `Van' cultivar when growing on the dwarfing rootstocks, `Gisela 5' and `Edabriz'. This fact allows the inference that invigorating rootstocks could keep scion growth active for longer periods, lengthening the photosynthetically active season and individual shoot growth. This could be a consequence of a delayed arrival of the flux of hormonal compounds to the canopy, that determine the entrance into dormancy and leaf senescence and fall.},

The “Zalema” GFLV-distribution was more heterogeneous, being the central area, with better wine quality, that with lower virus-attack (8.7\%). The infection average of this cultivar was 27.5\%. In the “Montilla-Moriles” zone, the infection average was 26.2\% and the geographical distribution was very heterogeneous. Nevertheless the vineyards with higher virus attack appear grouped. This area was the only with some plots free of GFLV presence. No relation was established between GFLV-infection and plant density or rootstock type and low relationship was found with plant age, bad cultural conditions and Xiphinema index or italiae. The use of non controlled GFLV-infected scion for grafting was the most important way of virus transmission. The in vitro culture was a good method for the obtaining of GFLV free plants, reaching even 100\%. The in vitro culture was also interesting to establish differences between the non-infected and infected plant material, according to the in vitro plant stem growth, being significantly lower in the infected one. In a field experiment with “Zalema” cultivar, signs of juvenility (very high growth, red colour and pubescens in leaves and no production) were observed in the growing scions the first year after grafting. In the following years those sings disappeared and the production was practically two-fold of the normal field surrounding plants.},

According to root weight the rootstocks `Kober 5BB' and `Teleki SO 4' in some cases came close to `Paulsen 1103', but they did not always enable the transfer of roots vigorous growth to shoots. Two experiments in vineyard confirmed strong vegetative growth hypothesis of `Paulsen 1103'. In one case rootstock `Fercal' came close to `Paulsen 1103' and in other case `Kober 5BB' and `Ruggeri 140' were close, too.

The scions (2-4 cm) and rootstocks (23 cm) were fixed using an elastic electric-wire tube or alginate gel beads. After grafting, the bases of rootstocks were dipped in 1000 ppm indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) solution for 5 s (grapevine) or 10 s (American chestnut and hybrid hazelnut). Grafted plantlets were then cultured in jiffy peat plugs in vitro or placed in jiffy peat plugs ex vitro and were gradually acclimatized. Scions of in vitro cultured grafts developed aerial roots and the grafting was unsuccessful. Two months after grafting, the survival of successful ex vitro grafts was ca. 50\% for grapevine, 70\% for hazelnut, and 80\% for American chestnut. The results indicate that, when grafted plants are preferred to own-rooted plants, micropropagated scion and rootstocks can simultaneously be grafted, rooted and acclimatized ex vitro.},

	volume = {135},
	issn = {0008-347X},
	abstract = {The dogwood borer, Synanthedon scitula (Harris) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae), has the broadest host range of the clearwing moths and is considered to be an economically important pest of many ornamental, fruit, and nut trees. Since the 1980s, dogwood borer has been recognized as an increasingly important, indirect pest of apple, Malus domestica Borkh. (Rosaceae), in eastern North America, owing mainly to increased plantings of apple on size-controlling rootstocks that promote the formation of adventitious root initials (burr knots) on the rootstock and scion. Burr knots appear to be preferred oviposition sites for dogwood borer females, although infestations can also be initiated in wounds, pruning cuts, and crotches on the branches and trunk. Larval feeding in burr knots does not adversely affect the growth and vigor of apple trees, but their mining outward from burr knots into vascular tissue can ultimately cause tree decline and death. Chlorpyrifos is the most effective insecticide for controlling dogwood borer. A supplemental label in the United States permits post-bloom, trunk drench applications of chlorpyrifos specifically for control of borers in apple, with several restrictions that preclude control of infestations higher in the tree. The ongoing review of pesticide tolerances dictated by the 1996 Food Quality Protection Act of the United States of America makes the long-term availability of this chemical uncertain. Cultural practices, such as deeper planting or berming, can reduce the likelihood of infestation of new apple plantings by dogwood borer, although they do not preclude infestations from developing above the graft union. This review and discussion is based on our contention that research toward the development of alternative, behaviorally based management strategies for dogwood borer in apple and other economically important host plants is warranted. Our review and synthesis of the dogwood borer literature revealed important gaps in knowledge about basic aspects of its biology that pertain directly to the development of alternative control tactics based on behavioral manipulation. There is considerable confusion surrounding the sex pheromone of dogwood borer and conflicting results on the response of males to isomers and blends of isomers of its purported pheromone. Studies using sex attractants to monitor its phenology in apple and non-apple habitats have yielded discrepant results and conclusions. Differences in the effectiveness of commercially available pheromone lures for trapping dogwood borer have been reported and the ability of pheromone traps to accurately reflect emergence or population density remains in question. Regardless of pronounced differences in the duration and modality of the seasonal flight of dogwood borer among different geographical regions within its range, the conclusion of univoltinism across most of its range has been perpetuated, based on extremely limited developmental data collected exclusively from individuals that developed on dogwood.},

	abstract = {Potential problems associated with saline irrigation waters can be compounded by irrigation practices. Methods for water application become of prime importance under saline conditions. The effect of irrigation water quantity and salinity on fruit yield, fruit quality and leaf mineral composition were studied in a field experiment with 6-year-old lemon trees, cv. Fino 49, on the Macrophylla, (Citrus Macrophylla Wester) rootstock during 1998-2000. Trees were irri.-ated with three different qualities of water, having an electrical conductivity 1, 2.5 and 4 dS/m, respectively. For each salinity treatment, trees were irrigated with two different quantities of water, 100 and 125\% crop evapotranspiration. Lemon fruit yield significantly decreased with increasing salinity, due to a decrease in the number of fruits per tree. This reduction was caused by an increase in fruitlet drop off induced by salinity. A significant increase of lemon fruit yield was observed in the last year by increasing the quantity of water. Salinity and amount of water applied affected fruit quality. The percentage of fruit juice, with respect to the total fruit weight, was greater in fruits from the control than for those in the salinity treatments. The opposite effect was observed for peel and pulp contents. Titratable acidity (TA) and total soluble solids (TSS) decreased with salinity, although the ratio TSS:TA was similar in all treatments. Chloride and sodium concentrations in leaves were raised by salinity and amounts of water applied. Data on accumulation of other nutrients in relation to salinity, water application and season are also presented. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In Hungary the detection of virus and virus-like diseases of grapevine began in 1960's at the Research Institute for Viticulture and Enology by Janos Lehoczky and his colleagues. At present sixteen virus and virus-like diseases of Vitis vinifera are known to occur in Hungary. Some of these viruses, for example fanleaf and leafroll cause significant yield loss and/or lower fruit quality. Other virus diseases, for example, Rugose wood complex can provoke untimely death of grapevine stocks. A few viruses are latent. Little is known about their effects on grapevine, however occurrence of these diseases is quite frequent, so they may have high economic importance. Regular virological screening of grapevine varieties started in 1972. The present system of screening (visual selection, indexing, ELISA) has been established using methods with continuous improvement according to recommendations of international organizations. In the first year symptomless grapevine plants are selected and marked during surveys carried out twice in the vegetation period: at about flowering and in the second half of September. At the first selection time plants are sampled for ELISA. In the spring of the second year, overwintered canes are checked by woody indexing on 8 indicator species in the field. In the third and fourth years the nursery is evaluated twice again. At the end, the marked grapevine plants, giving negative results on all indicators in every case, are considered virus-free. In autumn of the fourth year, the virus-free material is planted out under screenhouse and also in a special mother block (nuclear stock) for maintenance and propagation. During these propagation steps, visual observation and random tests by ELISA are done to monitor the virus status of the plants. The propagation is performed under strict official control by the National Plant Protection Service. Trueness to type is also monitored by the inspectors of National Institute for Agricultural Quality Control. Mother blocks of virus-free scion varieties have been established on 2 ha and those of rootstock varieties on 0,5 ha planted with the following number of varieties included in the national list: 71 European scion - and 12 rootstock varieties or variety candidates/clones. Number of other virus-free varieties and clones: 42. There are 167,8 ha of virus-free Pre-base, Base and Certified stocks from 71 European scion varieties and 98,4 ha from 12 rootstock varieties. So it is necessary to increase the area of Pre-base, Base and Certified stocks exclusively with tested virus-free (clean) material. It can be said that the sanitary and clone selection, maintenance and propagation of the vine meets EU standards in Hungary.},

	abstract = {Potassium (K) is essential for vine growth and yield. Grape berries are a strong sink for K, particularly during ripening. Excess K levels in grape berries may have a negative impact on wine quality, mainly because it decreases free tartaric acid resulting in an increase in the pH of grape juice, must and wine. In Australia, high K status is common in most vineyards, which reflects the high K and high pH values of most Australian grape juice. This necessitates pH adjustment during the vinification process, and tartaric acid addition is a common practice in most Australian wineries. High K concentration may also lead to excessive loss of the additional tartaric acid by precipitation as potassium bitartrate and, as a consequence, pH adjustment becomes more difficult and expensive. Ensuring naturally low K levels in the berry will help reduce costs of input and waste management at the winery. Potential vineyard management options to manipulate berry K accumulation include selective use of rootstock/scion combination, canopy management and irrigation strategies. However, the impact of these practices on determining the optimum K concentration requires careful calibration of production parameters and the desirable grape juice and wine quality in relation to tissue K concentration. This paper reviews and discusses the possible functions of K in grape berries, translocation of K into the berry, and genetic and cultural factors that may affect the accumulation of K in the berry. This will help to identify the key research and management strategies needed for controlling K concentrations in grape berries.},

To address this question, four rootstock-scion combinations, originating from three commercial nurseries in the Wellington area of the Western Cape Province of South Africa were investigated during the 1999/2000 season. The first isolations were made in September from callused cuttings prior to planting in nurseries. After planting, asymptomatic rooted cuttings were selected from nurseries after 3, 6 and 9 months. Isolations were made from the roots, rootstock, grafting union and scion. Isolations from callused cuttings prior to planting clearly demonstrated that primary pathogens associated with Petri disease, such as Phaeomoniella chlamydospora and Phaeoacremonium spp. were already present in the apparently healthy rootstock propagation material as endophytes. However, Cylindrocarpon spp., which cause black foot disease, rarely occurred in propagation material at this time. Species of this genus were isolated at higher percentages later during the season. Less than 1\% of the plants were infected with Cylindrocarpon spp. before planting in the nursery (October), whereas 50\% or more of the plants were infected at the end of the season (June). These findings suggest that the low percentage survival of vine plants observed in recent years is partly due to infected propagation material, and to new infections established in nurseries.},

Roots of 10 different rootstocks were examined for the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi at the end of the second growing season (1998), and at the time of veraison (onset of ripening) of the third (1999) and fourth (2000) growing seasons. The fine root length density (primary roots with intact cortex) increased in 6 of 10 rootstocks over time. Only one rootstock, Riparia Gloire, showed a marked decrease in fine root length density in 2000, when vines carried their first significant fruit crop. AM colonization was generally above 60\% of fine root length for all rootstocks, although significant differences due to rootstock and time of sampling were evident. Rootstocks imparting greater vigor to the scion, particularly Ruggeri 140, Kober 513B, and SO-4 had consistently higher levels of root colonization by AM fungi. The proportion of roots containing arbuscules at veraison declined from 1999 to 2000 in those rootstocks carrying the highest crop loads. While AM colonization of different rootstocks was positively correlated to yield, the proportion of roots with arbuscules was negatively correlated to yield in 2000. Results of this study show that small differences in the ability to form mycorrhizas exist among rootstocks, but other factors, including crop load and soil moisture, have a large influence on root colonization by AM fungi.},

This involved a non-linear least squares fit method to determine the threshold of ECe it which yield begins to decline and the slope of the yield reduction with increasing ECe above that threshold. Threshold and slope are the two key parameters in this piecewise linear model of grapevine response to salinity. The soil ECe values were integrated to take account of both spatial and temporal variation in soil salinity within the profile. The ECe threshold for own-rooted Sultana at Merbein in the Sunraysia region was found to be 2.3 +/- 0.2 dS/m and the slope of yield reduction above the threshold was 8.9 +/- 1.2 \% per 1 dS/m increase in soil ECe. At Dareton, a similar threshold of 2.1 +/- 0.3 dS/m was found for own-rooted Sultana, however the higher slope of the yield reduction (15.0 +/- 2.0 \%) relative to the same vines at Merbein may have been related to the higher sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) in irrigation water and its impacts on soil physical properties, especially in that part of the vineyard with a heavier soil type. The rootstock Ramsey resulted in a threshold of 3.3 +/- 0.2 dS/m and slope of 5.7 +/- 0.4 \% with the scion Colombard at Loxton, indicating a more tolerant combination of scion-rootstock to salinity. The rootstocks 1103 Paulsen and R2 with Sultana as scion were the most salt tolerant, with no discernible yield reduction until ECe exceeded about 4 dS/m. Of four other rootstocks with Sultana as scion, compared with own-rooted sultana, J17-69, and R4 had similar threshold values (2.3 +/- 0.2 and 2.5 +/- 0.2 dS/m) and slopes of yield reduction (10.1 +/- 1.9 \% and 8.0 +/- 0.5 \%, respectively), while R1 had a similar threshold of 1.8 +/- 0.2 dS/m but a lower slope of yield reduction (4.3 +/- 0.9 \%) than Sultana on own roots and R3, J17-69, R1 and R4 rootstocks. Comparatively, R3 rootstock responded differently by way of a higher threshold of 3.0 +/- 0.2 dS/m than own-rooted Sultana and J17-69 and R1 rootstocks and a higher slope of yield reduction of 12.4 +/- 1.0 \% relative to Sultana on own roots and R4 and R1 rootstocks. Based on our long-term studies of yield-salinity relationships on contrasting sites, the pre-eminence of certain rootstocks in conferring tolerance to soil salinity has been confirmed. Ramsey, 1103 Paulsen, and a new hybrid designed here as R3 were generally outstanding, with Ramsey varying only slightly in its comparative effectiveness when grafted to different scion varieties. An overall interaction between scion variety and rootstock genotype was thus evident in the form of yield-salinity relationships.},

	abstract = {A cooperative study was initiated between the University of Arkansas and California State University, Fresno, to determine the effect of rootstock on productivity, fruit, and wine composition. Viticultural data were collected for four years in Arkansas and three years in California, and wine was made one year. Chardonel scion wood was bench-grafted on Cynthiana, Freedom, Kober 5BB, and Richter 110 rootstock. Grafted vines and own-rooted vines were planted in Fayetteville, AR, and Fresno, CA. Vineyard establishment, trellis systems, and cultural practices were standardized between locations. The two locations have different soils and climates, and results differed between locations. Grapes grown in Fresno (3 year means) had higher total soluble solids (23.5 Brix) and titratable acidity (8.0 g/L) and lower pH (3.44) than grapes grown in Fayetteville (4 year means), which had 20.5 Brix, 6.4 g/L titratable acidity, and 3.60 pH. The greatest benefits of using rootstocks were seen in Fayetteville, where yield increases of 40 and 19\% were obtained with 5BB and 110R, respectively, as compared to own-rooted vines. Cynthiana produced the lowest yields, and Freedom produced the largest vine size at both locations. Grapes from vines grafted to 110R had a lower pH than own-rooted vines at Fayetteville. Otherwise, there were few composition differences between own-rooted, Freedom, 5BB, and 110R rootstocks. Wines produced from fruit of vines grafted to Freedom had the highest pH at both locations. There were few other differences in wine pH or acidity among grapes that were not attributable to fruit maturity. There was not a major advantage to using rootstock in Fresno. The use of 110R seems to hold an advantage in Fayetteville over own-rooted vines due to higher yield and lower pH.},

	abstract = {Several perennial, deciduous, as well as evergreen fruit crops develop symptoms of iron deficiency - interveinal chlorosis of apical leaves-when cultivated in calcareous and alkaline soils. Under these conditions fruit yield and quality is depressed in the current year and fruit buds poorly develop for following year fruiting. This paper reviews the main fundamental and applied aspects of iron (Fe) nutrition of deciduous fruit crops and grapevine and discusses the possible development of sustainable Fe nutrition management in orchard and vineyard ecosystems. Cultivated grapevines and most deciduous fruit trees are made up of two separate genotypes the cultivar and the rootstock, providing the root system to the tree. The effect of the rootstock on scion tolerance of Fe chlorosis is discussed in terms of biochemical responses of the roots to acquire iron from the soil. Symptoms of iron chlorosis in orchards and vineyards are usually more frequent in spring when shoot growth is rapid and bicarbonate concentration in the soil solution buffers soil pH in the rhizosphere and root apoplast. Since the solubility of Fe-oxides is pH dependent, under alkaline and calcareous soils inorganic Fe availability is far below that required to satisfy plant demand, so major role on Fe nutrition of trees is likely played by the iron chelated by microbial siderophores, chelated by phytosiderophores (released into the soil by graminaceous species) and complexed by organic, matter. As most fruit tree species belong to Strategy I-based plants (which do not produce phytosiderophores in their roots) Fe uptake is preceded by a reduction step from Fe3+ to Fe2+. The role of ferric chelate reductase and proton pump activities in Fe uptake and the possible adoption of these measurements for screening procedure in selecting Fe chlorosis tolerant rootstocks are discussed. In a chlorotic leaf the existence of Fe pools which are somehow inactivated has been demonstrated, suggesting that part of the Fe coming from the roots does not pass the leaf plasmamembrane and may be confined to the apoplast: the reasons and the importance for inactivation of Fe in the apoplast are discussed. The use of Fe chlorosis tolerant genotypes as rootstocks in orchards and vineyards represents a reliable solution to prevent iron chlorosis; in some species, however, available Fe chlorosis resistant rootstocks are not very attractive from an agronomic point of view since they often induce excessive growth of the scion and reduce fruit yields. As most fruit tree crops and grapes are high value commodities, in many countries growers are often willing to apply synthetic Fe chelates to cure or to prevent the occurrence of Fe deficiency. The application of iron chelates does not represent a sustainable way to prevent or cure iron chlorosis because of to their costs and of the environmental risks associated with their use. Since Fe chelates were introduced, little research on alternative means for controlling the chlorosis has been performed. Sustainable management of Fe nutrition in orchards and vineyards should include all genetical and agronomical means in order to naturally enhance Fe availability in the soil and in the plant. Special attention should be given to soil analysis and to prevention measures carried out before planting. Alternatives to iron chelates are being developed and in the future they should be included into the routine practices or managing fruit trees and grapevine under Integrated Production and Organic Farming.

	abstract = {This paper describes variation in transpiration efficiency `W' (where W=dry matter produced/water transpired) among grapevine genotypes grown under well-watered conditions in either a glasshouse or a vineyard. Nineteen genotypes were grown in a glasshouse where growth and transpiration were measured. W ranged from 2.5 to 3.4 g dm/kg H2O transpired. Carbon-isotope discrimination (Delta) of laminae dry matter ranged from 20.8 to 22.7 parts per thousand and there was a negative relationship (R-2=0.58) between W and Delta. A large proportion of variation in W could be attributed to variation in stomatal conductance. Genotypic variation in photosynthetic capacity was also an important component of variation in W. In a second experiment, lamina Delta was measured for mature field-grown Shiraz and Chardonnay, grown either on their own roots or grafted to five different rootstocks, and maintained at three sites under well-watered conditions. At all sites and regardless of rootstock, the laminae of Chardonnay had Delta values 1 to 2\%. lower than Shiraz. There was also a 1 to 2 parts per thousand variation among the sites. Rootstock variety affected Delta values inconsistently and by a maximum of 0.5 parts per thousand. Leaf gas exchange measurements were performed at a single site on sun-exposed leaves of Chardonnay and Shiraz on either their own roots or 1103 Paulsen, a moderate to high vigour rootstock. There was no significant effect of rootstock on leaf gas exchange and photosynthetic rates did not differ between scion varieties. However, Chardonnay had a 20\% lower stomatal conductance and a 1.4-fold higher ratio of CO2 assimilation/H2O transpiration (A/T) indicating a potentially higher W, at a leaf level, for Chardonnay compared with Shiraz. We conclude that photosynthetic capacity was also higher for Chardonnay. Delta values, predicted from the C-i/C-a ratio calculated from leaf gas exchange measurements, did not differ significantly from measured values for laminae Delta. This similarity for Delta, in conjunction with the fact that the lower Delta of Chardonnay was reflected in a higher A/T ratio, suggests that Delta may be a reliable predictor of comparative W under vineyard conditions.},

The main difference seems to be in the ability to absorb chloride and sodium from the soil and/or the ability to translocate the harmful ions to the scion.

However, constructing a traditional field experiment involves the use of many border trees, rendering such experiments expensive and thus rare. A field experiment was constructed using trickle linear-gradient salinity (TLG). `Marsh' Grapefruit (Citrus paradisi) were grafted on 10 different citrus rootstocks, planted in the Northern Negev, Israel. The experimental orchard was drip irrigated with reclaimed water and subjected to an additional linear salinity gradient (TLG) along the rows. The TLG setup enabled us to construct a major factorial field experiment without border trees, and differences between the rootstocks were significant within one summer.},

Half the nitrogen was applied four weeks pre-flowering and half at the end of flowering. Glutamine accounted for over 85\% of xylem nitrogen, indicating that most soil nitrogen was assimilated by way of vine root metabolism. Nitrogen supply increased the translocation of glutamine, glutamate, NO3-, NH4+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and PO43- in the xylem sap and decreased the ratio of organic to inorganic nitrogen, V. berlandieri x V. riparia crosses generally resulted in higher xylem solute concentrations compared with other rootstocks, but were less effective in total nitrogen assimilation. High soil nitrogen increased vine leaf area by stimulating lateral-shoot growth, increased leaf chlorophyll, photosynthesis, transpiration and stomatal conductance, and delayed leaf senescence. There was no difference among rootstocks in scion leaf area, but rootstocks affected scion response to soil nitrogen level in terms of leaf chlorophyll content and leaf gas exchange; SO4 induced the strongest reaction to soil N, whereas Ru-140 elicited the least reaction. Chlorophyll content was highest for vines grafted on 5BB and lowest for C-3309. Photosynthesis response to both nitrogen and rootstock was regulated at the mesophyll level. There were few interactions between nitrogen and rootstocks, and their contribution to total variance was small relative to main effects. Thus, with the exception of SO4, differences due to rootstocks were mostly unaffected by soil nitrogen level.},

Tetraploid citrus rootstocks have been shown to have a built-in tree size control component due to polyploidy. This report focuses on the incorporation of newly identified superior rootstock germplasm into the somatic hybridization programme. Poncirus trifoliata 50-7, a selection of trifoliate orange selected for superior resistance to Phytophthora nicotianae, was hybridized with sour orange, Changsha mandarin, Navel orange, and a seedy white `Duncan' type grapefruit. High-yielding Benton citrange (Citrus sinensis X Poncirus trifoliata) was hybridized with Changsha mandarin and sour orange. More than 200 plants of each of these six new somatic hybrids were propagated via tissue culture and rooted cuttings. To assess their horticultural performance, all the somatic hybrids were budded with commercially important scions and planted in replicated trials representing the two most important soil types in Florida. Seed trees of each somatic hybrid have also been planted in the fit ld to determine fruiting potential and level of polyembryony.},

The vines of the two strains were then planted in the same vineyard. Shoot growth and berry development on each vine were recorded throughout the growing season. The partitioning of C-13-photosynthates from leaves into the various parts of the shoot of the two strains, which were exposed to (CO2)-C-13 at two weeks after veraison, was investigated. No significant differences in shoot elongation, increment of leaf area per shoot, and changes in chlorophyll content of leaves between the two strains were observed. No notable difference in berry enlargement between the two strains was observed, although the berries at harvest from vines B and D were significantly heavier than those from vines A and C. The total soluble solids contents of the juice and anthocyanin levels of the skins were higher in berries from SEC vines than in those from IBC vines throughout the ripening stage; they increased significantly in the SEC vines two to three weeks after veraison. At harvest, anthocyanin content in the berry skins from vines of SEC was two to three times higher than in those from vines of IBC. At the end of (CO2)-C-13 feeding, the leaves on the main shoot of the SEC vines contained significantly more C-13 label than those of the IBC vines. 13C concentration in leaves on both main and lateral shoots on all vines decreased rapidly for 24 hr after feeding followed by a gradual decrease, whereas it increased in berries with time. At 72 hr and 120 hr after feeding, C-13-photosynthates were translocated into berries larger in SEC vines than those in IBC vines. At 120 hr after feeding, the distribution ratio of C-13-photosynthates in the berries was higher in SEC vines than in IBC vines, while it was the reverse in the leaves on the main shoot. The relationship between translocation and partitioning of photosynthates and the accumulation of sugar and anthocyanin in berries, which differed between vines of the two strains, is discussed.},

In the second trial Welschriesling was grafted on 12 rootstocks. Their growth during the first year in the vineyard was measured. As an index of compatibility, the percentage of first grade grafted vines as well as dry weight of mature shoots (canes) and roots was determined. After the grafts went through the first phase of healing often called callusing (2-3 weeks of moist warm conditions), the differences in callus formation were greater between years than among rootstocks, which were the most obvious with Furmint as a scion. No good callus formation occurred when cane (rootstock, scion) maturity is not adequate. Such was the case in 2005, there were 24\% fewer grafts with fully developed callus than those in 2006. The dry weight of roots was higher on 5BB than on Borner and SO4. Borner rootstock had fewer roots, and the roots were thinner. Welschriesling had good compatibility with all rootstocks (the average grafts success was 67\%), but that of 5BB, G251, and G103 (above 80\%),was greater than the average. The G103 rootstock had the highest dry weight of roots. Shoot growth in vineyards was above the average with 5BB, SO4, Binova, Rimer, and MV rootstocks. All Georgikon rootstocks had a lower cane dry weight per vine than the others. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Some factors for this hegemony are the adequate ecological conditions, which allows for cultivation without irrigation, and huge land availability. Threats, however, exist especially at the core of national production, in the State of Sao Paulo. The most important, bacterial and virus diseases, appear with increasingly incidence and destructive power. The Northeast Region, the second national producing region, apparently presents the best conditions for the citrus industry expansion. Among potential areas, the Sao Francisco Valley appears as one the best options due to the semiarid climate, governmental support and tradition in the irrigated fruit production and export. The region, with 360,000 ha potentially irrigable, is located between 8 and 9 degrees S and 40 and 42 degrees W and altitude of 300 m a.s.l. The annual rainfall is less than 600 mm and the average temperature is 26.2 degrees C, relative humidity of 67\% and solar radiation of 3,000 h/year, constituting a comparative advantage to species such as acid lime, lemon and grapefruit. Citrus scions and rootstocks trials have been carried out since the 1990s by Embrapa in cooperation with the private sector in the States of Bahia and Pernambuco, which results are presented in this paper, showing the potentiality of the Sao Francisco Valley as a new belt for the Brazilian citrus industry.},

Rootstock Improvement: Initial focus was on improving soil adaptation, tree-size control to facilitate harvesting and cold-protection, and disease resistance, especially to blight, CTV-induced quick decline and Phytophthora. Breeding objectives have since been expanded to include tolerance of the Diaprepes/Phytophthora complex and Huanglongbing HLB, and development of rootstocks that facilitate advanced citrus production systems (ACPS). Progress from conventional breeding (both 2x and 4x) and somatic hybridization will be discussed. Genetic Engineering: Due to the HLB and canker epidemics, focus has been on disease resistance gene discovery, transformation, and evaluation of transgenic plants; progress will be discussed.},

	abstract = {Citrus is an economically important world tree fruit crop with production in more than 146 countries. The center of origin for citrus is considered to be Southeastern Asia including southern China, northeastern India, and Malaysia, with secondary centers in surrounding areas. Novel and commercially significant scion and rootstock cultivars originating by natural mutation or directed hybridization were introduced during the past century. Significant genetic resource collections exist in many countries. A global citrus germplasm network was developed in 1997. Now that the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGR) has recognized Citrus as an Annex 1 crop, a global conservation strategy needs to be established. The objective of this workshop was to plan the development of this strategy. More than 60 delegates attended with representation from Argentina, Australia, Bhutan, Brazil, China, Columbia, France, Iran, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Morocco, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, UAE, US, and Vietnam. Nine oral presentations were given describing multiple aspects of genebank operations, technologies and gaps in Brazil, China, France, Australia, Spain, and the US. A draft genebank survey questionnaire was presented to the group and comments and suggested changes for improvement were received. Citrus curators and genebank managers throughout the world will be surveyed for the status and health of their collections. The surveys will be received and compiled by collaborators at the University of California, Riverside, and at the USDA ARS Riverside. This information will be compiled and reported. The strategy will include background and history of the development of Citrus as a cultivated crop, conservation protocols, vulnerabilities, and recommendations for safeguarding Citrus germplasm. This strategy will be implemented through the Global Crop Diversity Trust with collaboration from the International Society for Horticultural Science and the international Citrus research community.},

	abstract = {By parasitizing the roots of Vitis species, grape phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae Fitch, Phylloxeridae) is one of the most devastating pests in viticulture. Grafting susceptible scions (Vitis vinifera) to tolerant Vitis rootstocks is a common practice to control grape phylloxera in wine growing regions worldwide. However, grape phylloxera populations still develop on the roots of most grafting combinations. Questions remain as to whether or not the impact of environmental factors on grape phylloxera population dynamics is related to Vitis rootstock cultivars. In the presented field study, we investigated the influence of two closely related mature Vitis berlandieri x Vitis riparia rootstock varieties on the relations between the dynamics of root feeding grape phylloxera populations, root morphology and abiotic factors. The investigation took place on a commercial vineyard in Geisenheim/Germany on Teleki 5C/V vinifera `Weisser Riesling' and Kober 125AA/V. vinifera `Weisser Riesling'. Samples of roots, attached grape phylloxera populations and soil were taken in the field 19 times between August 2007 and August 2009. Grape phylloxera population structure was recorded by the occurrence of root-feeding wingless females, fundatrices and nymphs and the pigmentation and position of root galls were assessed. Root morphological parameters were assessed using WinRhizo Pro. Soil abiotic parameters were assessed in the laboratory. Results of a principal component analysis showed rootstock related differences considering the impact of abiotic factors on grape phylloxera population structure. Especially soil temperature and soil organic matter were indicated to have a lower impact on grape phylloxera population structure on roots of 5C than on roots of 125AA. Our data indicate that ecological factors have a lower impact on the development of grape phylloxera on more supportive rootstocks.},

The present work aimed to characterise the effect of rootstock genotype and water deficit on the primary and secondary metabolism of the grape berry. Methods and ResultsVitis vinifera cv. Pinot Noir grafted on either rootstock 110R (drought tolerant, mid to high vigour) or 125AA (drought sensitive, high vigour) was studied during three growing seasons in the field under normal rainfall or water shortage conditions. Water status, yield and berry composition (sugars, organic acids, free amino acids and anthocyanins) were measured throughout berry development during the three growing seasons. Water stress did not significantly affect berry mass, yield, sugar and organic acids concentration, but increased anthocyanin concentration of the berries regardless of the rootstock. Furthermore, the data showed that the berry amino acid concentration at harvest depended on interactions between water supply and rootstocks. ConclusionsScion berry composition differed only slightly between the two rootstocks tested. Rootstocks and water stress, however, affected the concentration of amino acids, and plants grafted onto 125AA were more sensitive to drought stress.

	abstract = {As the home of numerous grape genotypes, Turkey is one of the major centers of viniculture genetic material in the world. Merzifon Karasi' (Vitis vinifera L.) is one of the most valuable red wine grape cultivars in Turkey. However, despite the variety's relative age, Merzifon Karasi' has yet to be tested on different rootstocks. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the effects of different rootstocks on the growth characteristics of Merzifon Karasi' scion. Growth parameters (shoot length (cm), shoot diameter (mm), internode length (cm), total and unit leaf area (cm(2)), root length (cm), root scale (0-4) and root number) were calculated and carbohydrate content (\%) of the grafted grapevine shoots, trunk and roots analysed for 9 different rootstocks. Significant differences (P {\textless} 0.01) were found among rootstocks. 8B and Rupestris du Lot rated best in terms of root length, root scale and root number (P {\textless} 0.01). Highest shoot length, shoot diameter (P {\textless} 0.01) and internode length were obtained, respectively, with the 110R, 8B and Rupestris du Lot rootstocks (P {\textless} 0.05). Rupestris du Lot also produced the grapevines with the highest total leaf area per plant and main shoot, whereas the grapevines grafted on 8B had the highest unit leaf area (P {\textless} 0.01). Sugar, starch and carbohydrate contents (\%) of the different plant parts also varied significantly by root-stock (P {\textless} 0.01), with the highest root carbohydrate content measured in the 5C (22.4 \%) rootstock, and the highest trunk and shoot carbohydrate content measured in the 110R (12.1 and 13.4\%, respectively). In sum, the study found the best rootstocks for Merzifon Karasi' to be 8B, Rupestris du Lot and 110R in terms of root and shoot growth, whereas `Merzifon Karasi' grape grafted onto 110R and 5C rootstock had the highest carbohydrate contents.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the agronomical responses of twelve clones of the Bordo cultivar selected over a period of 15 years according to yield and quality. The vineyard was planted in 2008. Grape plants were grafted onto `1103 Paulsen' rootstock and trained on vertical shoot positioning. The agronomical evaluations, performed in the 2011, 2012 and 2013 seasons, covered the duration of their phenological cycles, shoot growth, yield per plant, estimated total yield and physicochemical characteristics. Differences were found between clones in terms of phenology, yield components, and berry composition. Clone 6 had the lowest yield, averaging 5.0 t ha(-1) whereas clone 13 was the most productive with 14.9 t ha(-1). Based on the most productive vineyards in the region (10.8 t ha(-1)), the adoption of more productive clones can generate an increase in yield of around 38 \%.},

	abstract = {One of the main objectives of wine grape growers in several viticultural areas throughout history has been the achievement of full ripening, i.e. maximum soluble solids concentration in the absence of apparent berry shrinkage. Recently, this target is somewhat losing its appeal since an increasing number of consumers from both domestic and foreign markets prefer lighter wines characterized by moderate alcohol content. The above scenario needs to be added of another actor, i.e. the global warming and its effects on vine growth and berry composition which can be summarized as it follows: (i) onset of flowering and veraison phenological stages occurs earlier; (ii) grape ripening is generally accelerated as per increment of sugar accumulation into the berries which, in turn, leads to higher alcohol content in the wine; (iii) faster depletion of organic acids in the juice and more rapid increase of pH values which, as a consequence, triggers high microbiological instability of the must during pre-fermentation; (iv) due to excessive heat summations and poor thermal excursion the overall aroma profile can result untypical shifting towards overripe; (v) uncoupling of technological (more accelerated) and phenolic (more delayed) ripening with negative effects on grape and wine aroma and flavor, especially in red grape varieties; (vi) higher frequency of berry withering up to sun burn damage. In the medium-to-long term these factors likely will affect the geographical distribution of viticulture and will require new breeding programs for selecting more adapted roostocks and scions, whereas in the short term, new management techniques able to mitigate these negative impacts are urgently needed. In this review, several tools including varietal and clonal choice, possible diversification of wines produced, suitable training system and rootstocks, traditional and innovative management techniques able to regulate a too much accelerated and/or unbalanced grape ripening process, will be presented and discussed.

Methods and ResultsChardonnay and Shiraz, on own roots and on nine rootstocks, were irrigated for the first 12 seasons with water of electrical conductivity (ECiw) of 2.1dS/m, with 7.15ML/ha the mean total applied. The final two seasons were years of water restrictions, where the vines were irrigated with water of (mean) ECiw of 1.65dS/m at a seasonal application of 3.04ML/ha. Vines on own roots had a relatively low yield, for example 2.0kg/vine (Chardonnay) and 8.8kg/vine (Shiraz), and a high concentration of both chloride and sodium in grape juice ({\textgreater}1000mg/L for Chardonnay and {\textgreater}500mg/L for Shiraz). Ramsey and 1103 Paulsen rootstocks produced a high yield of 11-12kg/vine with Chardonnay, and Ramsey and C7 produced a high yield of 23.5-24.5kg/vine with Shiraz. Chardonnay on C5 and Shiraz on C7 rootstocks had the lowest concentration of grape juice chloride and sodium (in each case {\textless}50mg/L). ConclusionsYield, a measure of salt tolerance, was positively correlated with rootstock-conferred vigour, measured by scion pruning mass. Neither yield nor pruning mass correlated with the concentration of either chloride or sodium in grape juice or in trunk wood, except that Shiraz yield correlated negatively with trunk wood Cl-.

	abstract = {Water scarcity is a key limiting factor in agriculture. Grapevines react at the physiological, biochemical and genetic level to tolerate water constraints. Even though grapevines are considered relatively tolerant to water deficits, grapevine growth and yield can be seriously reduced under water deficit. Drought-tolerant rootstocks are expected to enable the scion to grow and yield when water supply is limited. Genetic machinery allows rootstocks to control water extraction capacity and scion transpiration. Numerous works have demonstrated the positive role of drought-tolerant rootstocks on the control of cultivar's leaf stomatal conductance and therefore on canopy transpiration. The mechanisms, in terms of signalisation and gene functioning, need further study. Furthermore, there is no standardised methodology to rank rootstocks in terms of their tolerance to drought. A potential effect of rootstocks on stomatal development is also discussed. This review will critically discuss the current knowledge of the mechanisms of drought tolerance afforded by rootstocks, taking into account the scion/rootstock interaction, and will present some of the challenges for future investigations.},

	abstract = {Viral infections in grapevines cause physiological disorders that lead to foliar deformations, alterations in the berry color and finally reductions in productivity. Most viral infections in grapevine are disseminated by biological vectors and then by the vegetative propagation of infected material. More than 10 viruses commonly infect the grapevine, and it is not rare to find two or three different viruses in one infected plant. There are no efficient chemical treatments against virus infections. A molecular strategy to induce virus resistance in plants is gene silencing. This strategy requires the transformation of plants with a short sequence of the pathogen in a way that a double-strand RNA structure is formed during transcription, initiating gene silencing in the host. The objective of this work was the induction of virus silencing in grapevine rootstocks in order to use them for grafting. It is expected that the mobile silencing signal would induce virus silencing in the scion. We have transformed rootstocks (110 Richter and Harmony) by co-culturing embryogenic and organogenic tissues with Agrobacterium tumefaciens carrying a silencing vector containing a sequence of the coat protein of Grapevine fanleaf virus (GFLV). Twenty-six transgenic plants of the 110 Richter rootstock have been recovered, analyzed by RT-PCR for the GFLV sequence, and propagated to obtain several plants of each line. The transgenic rootstocks have been grafted with GFLV-infected plants that were positive for virus presence by RT-PCR analysis. Once the grafts were set, GFLV detection was carried out with scions using primers for the movement protein. After one month the detection of the virus was abolished in the scion, with three of six analyzed rootstock lines.},

	abstract = {Citrus crop are very sensitive to salinity, but their actual response may depend on several factors, among them the species used as scion. When growers have to choose a species for planting they need to know how it will behave in salt stress situations. The aim of this experiment was to evaluate the behaviour of two citrus species `Clemenules' mandarin (CLM) and `Star Ruby' grapefruit (SR), both grafted on `Cleopatra' mandarin rootstock, to establish their relative salt tolerance. The experiment was carried out over a 3 year period (2008-2010) in the IMIDA experimental farm located in Torre Pacheco (Murcia) using 15-year-old trees irrigated with 2 treatments: 0 mM NaCl and 40 mM NaCl. After the application of saline water for 3 consecutive years, the species revealed a different behaviour in response to salinity. Higher leaf Cl-and Na+ concentrations were observed in SR, which led to an important nutritional imbalance in the trees. The high leaf Na+ concentration in SR salinized-trees produced an antagonistic effect on leaf K+ concentrations. The salinity applied also produced a different response in the vegetative growth parameters of each species. SR was more affected by salinity in this respect, showing a substantial degree of defoliation during the first year. However, the leaf biomass of the trees gradually recovered from the second year onwards, pointing to signs of salinity acclimation. In CLM, on the other hand, leaf density was hardly affected by salinity during the three years of the experiment. The total accumulated yield ( 20082010) was only reduced by salinity in SR trees, mainly as a result of reduced fruit weight, although a lower fruit load was also observed in 2009. As regards fruit quality, salinity increased total soluble solids and acidity in both species, without affecting the maturity index. The external peel colour of SR fruit was greener as a result of salinity.},

Symptoms observed on citrus included branch cankers, dieback, and gumming. Various fungal species were recovered from necrotic tissues of branch canker and rootstock samples. Species were identified morphologically and by phylogenetic comparison as `Eureka' lemon, `Valencia', `Washington Navel', `Fukumoto', grapefruit, `Satsuma', and `Meyer' lemon. Species were identified morphologically and by phylogenetic comparison of the complete sequence of the internal transcribed spacer regions, (beta-tubulin gene, and elongation factor alpha-1 genes with those of other species in GenBank. A consensus-unrooted most parsimonious tree resulting from multigene phylogenetic analysis showed the existence of three major clades in the Botryosphaeriaceae family. In total, 74 isolates were identified belonging to the Botryosphaeriaceae family, with Neofusicoccum spp., Dothiorella spp., Diplodia spp., (teleomorph Botryosphaeria), Lasiodiplodia spp., and Neoscytalidium dimidiatum (teleomorphs unknown) accounting for 39, 25, 23, 10, and 3\% of the total, respectively. On inoculated Eureka lemon shoots, lesion length was significantly different (P {\textless} 0.05) among 14 isolates recovered from portions of cankered tissues of the original trees. Lesion lengths were significantly longer (P {\textless} 0.05) for shoots inoculated with isolates of Neofusicoccum luteum and shorter for shoots inoculated with isolates of Dothiorella viticola (P {\textless} 0.05) than those of other species. Identifying the distribution and occurrence of these fungal pathogens associated with Bot gummosis is useful for management applications during occasional outbreaks in California.},

A total of six rootstocks and six scion varieties were inoculated with mycelium of three isolates each of the most common Botryosphaeriaceae species (Neofusicoccum luteum, N. parvum and N. australe) recovered from New Zealand grapevine nurseries. Overall results showed that all isolates produced necrotic lesions on all varieties but susceptibility varied significantly (P {\textless} 0.001) with 5C and SO4 being the most susceptible of the rootstock varieties, and Merlot and Pinot noir being the most susceptible of the scions. Pathogenicity also varied significantly (P {\textless} 0.001) between species with N. parvum being the most virulent among three species tested. This study has further shown that different isolates of the three species have different levels of virulence providing evidence that these pathogens are genetically diverse. These results have significant implications for the New Zealand grapevine industry as the use of resistant varieties is not a possible option at present since none of the common varieties are resistant to these pathogens.},

The hybrids, their parents and two standard rootstocks, Ramsey (V champinii `Ramsey') and 1103 Paulsen (V. cinerea var. helleri `Resseguier \#2' x V rupestris `St. George') were replicated by clonal propagation and grown under glasshouse conditions either in potting mix, drip-irrigated with a nutrient solution containing 50, 1.7 and 30 mM Cl-, K+ and Na+, respectively, or in aerated nutrient solution containing 25, 1.7 and 15 mM Cl-, K+ and Na+, respectively. In both pot and solution culture trials, there were significant (P {\textless} 0.001) differences between parents for mean K+ (but not Na+) concentrations, and between hybrids for mean K+ and Na+ concentrations in laminae. This variation between the hybrids was continuous, indicating multiple rather than single gene control for K+ and Na+ accumulation within the family. Differences among the hybrids for lamina K+ accumulation were not strongly associated with plant vigour. While the ranking of some hybrids for K+ and Na+ accumulation was consistent between the trials, others responded differently, suggesting the environment of the rootzone may affect the K+ and Na+ accumulation phenotype.},

These components depend on a complex interaction between two genotypes (rootstock and scion) and other environmental factors. Climate change affects the physiology of the vine, yield and fruit composition, and ultimately the quality and authenticity of wines. In this context, we need to better understand the physiological mechanism and the genetic background underlying the interaction between viticulture and the environment, as this will be helpful for the development of sustainable concepts under changing conditions. We studied the interactions of two grapevine rootstocks (110R drought-tolerant and 125AA drought-sensitive) and two water regimes (well-watered and moderate water stressed) on grape berry composition of Pinot noir. These interactions are studied by integrating analysis of secondary metabolites, enzymes involved in primary and secondary metabolism, and gene expression. The transcriptional and metabolic profiling complemented with biochemical data of four developmental stages from berries still hard and green, through veraison to mature berries (EL 33, EL 35, EL 36, EL 38) and in three seasons (2009, 2010 and 2011) will be compared. The results will provide new information of the response of grape berry quality to rootstock and to drought.},

	abstract = {The effect of flooding on young grapevine plants grafted onto two rootstocks: Harmony and Freedom was evaluated. Grafted and non-grafted plants were grown in plastic pots under normal and flooding conditions. Flooding condition was obtained by keeping the water three cm above the soil and the oxygen diffusion rate (ODR) was 0.2 mu g O-2 cm(-2) min(-1): In control ODR was 1.7 mu g O-2 cm(-2) min(-1). Net CO2 assimilation and stomata conductance were evaluated in developing and mature leaves. In general, at the beginning of flooding, plants grafted on Harmony showed a rapid reduction in net CO2 assimilation. This reduction reached a minimum after at seven days of flooding treatment. By contrast, the plant grafted on Freedom did not show any reduction on net CO2 assimilation until seven days of flooding. This indicates that this last rootstock confers to the scion a tolerance to hypoxia. On the other hand, the reduction in net CO2 assimilation was well correlated with dry matter production and leaf area in both rootstocks. Harmony grafted plants presented the highest reduction (54\%) in dry matter accumulation, while Freedom grafted plants presented 36\% of reduction. After the flooding treatment, a significant increase in the accumulation of P was found in plants grafted on Harmony. This raises questions on the role of this element in the plant metabolism under low oxygen conditions. Finally, after the results obtained in dry matter reduction under flooding condition, we conclude that in `Sultanina' grafted plants, Freedom rootstock induced a better tolerance to hypoxia than Harmony.},

With a growing global demand for horticultural products and decreasing fresh water availability, improving the water use efficiency of irrigated horticultural crops has clear benefits for industry and society. Rootstocks are used in many crops and offer a potential mechanism to alter canopy processes for a given scion, particularly relevant in viticulture, where the scion is strongly associated with the product. Rootstocks may affect vine canopy function in various ways, most notably by altering scion vigour. Changes in scion growth have a direct impact on whole plant transpiration and yield, with potential effects on fruit quality. Rootstocks may also alter canopy responses to the environment, particularly to soil moisture. Through the use of a field trial with mature vines, we have examined the role rootstock selection has in determining canopy size, plant water use, crop yield and crop quality in winegrapes. We have determined that rootstock selection can alter both crop yield per unit of water transpired (crop water use index: CWUI) and the response of canopy physiology to a given soil environment. Assessment of current rootstocks for specific traits that impact CWUI and targeting future rootstock breeding towards these traits will provide improved rootstocks and improved horticultural practice.},

	abstract = {Soils in some major Australian viticultural regions are generally high in potassium content, which is in contrast to viticultural regions in other parts of the world. There is a considerable body of evidence, both from commercial experiences and research results, that the widely adopted high vigour, root-knot nematode tolerant rootstock varieties contribute to negative impacts on wine quality associated with high potassium uptake, high pH and malate levels. Previous findings have shown that in a given year, grafted vine grape juice pH at harvest is highly correlated with the ungrafted rootstock petiole potassium level at anthesis. We demonstrated that this relationship is also present when multiple years of juice pH and ungrafted rootstocks petioles are compared. The mean harvest pH of `Chardonnay' grafted on 6 commercial rootstocks from 4 vineyards over two consecutive years had a strong correlation (adjusted R-2= 0.755) with the 2 year mean potassium content of the ungrafted rootstocks in the field. Likewise, the 8 year mean pH of a rootstock trial with 5 commercial rootstock and 14 experimental rootstocks with `Shiraz' scions was highly correlated (adjusted R-2= 0.502) with the 2 year mean petiole potassium content of the ungrafted field grown rootstocks. To facilitate accelerated breeding of new rootstocks, we have developed a glasshouse based assay for the early selection of rootstocks with low potassium transport to aerial tissues. We demonstrated that the 8 year mean juice pH of grafted vines is also correlated with the ungrafted vine petiole potassium content for plants grown in the glasshouse with supplemented levels of potassium (adjusted R-2= 0.501). In addition, we are also screening vines in the glasshouse for resistance to the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne javanica. We are currently screening potential and commercial germplasm for resistance to M. javanica, and have identified a Vitis cinerea accession that transmits resistance as a single dominant gene.},

	abstract = {The double cropping system has been commercially adopted in subtropical viticulture regions. However, very limited information about rootstock and seasonal effects on berry quality traits are available for this unique production system. Developing `Kyoho' berries from own-rooted vines and from vines on 5C and 1202C rootstocks were periodically sampled from veraison until harvest in two consecutive cropping cycles to document the potential seasonal influence on rootstock effects. Anthocyanin concentration in berry skin, total soluble solids content (TSS), and titratable acidity (TA) were analyzed. In both cropping cycles, own-rooted vines produced berries with the highest anthocyanin concentration while vines on 1202C produced berries with the lowest anthocyanin concentration among the three scion/rootstocks. Anthocyanin concentrations were not differentiated by the differential climate pattern between the summer and the winter cropping cycles. Berries of own-rooted `Kyoho' and `Kyoho'/5C vines accumulated satisfactory and equal amount of TSS in both cropping cycles. 1202C rootstocks did not affect berry TSS in the summer cropping cycle but reduced TSS in the winter cropping cycle. Significant rootstock and seasonal effects on berry TA were detected. Own-rooted vines produced berries with the lowest TA while vines on 1202C produced berries with the highest TA among the three scion/rootstock combinations. TA of berries from the winter cropping cycle was significantly higher than that from the summer cropping cycle especially in `Kyoho'/1202C. Relationships between anthocyanins and TSS of developing berries after veraison properly fitted into a sigmoidal function regardless of rootstocks and cropping cycles. However, the duration of the initial lag phase, the onset and the trend of both quality triats in the increasing phase, and the presence and degree of the final lag phase in the relationship were all modulated by rootstocks and by seasonal variations.},

Recent trials comparing Juglans hindsii, a traditional rootstock for the area, with a new selection of Paradox rootstock, have shown the Paradox `entity' significantly outperforms J. hindsii in terms of scion growth in the first year. The Paradox hybrid has also been shown to grow vigorously in soils with shallow topsoil depth above calcareous B horizon subsoils. This suitability of the Paradox hybrid to calcareous soils provides the potential to expand the walnut industry into parts of the Murray Lowland Province characterized by Calcarosol soils with as little as 30 cm topsoil.},

	abstract = {Certain grapevine rootstocks in Vitis berlandieri hybrids (such as 41 B, one of the most important rootstocks used in worldwide viticulture) have great potential to use owing to its great resistance to calcareous soils and phylloxera. But their use is limited due to the difficulties in propagation and grafting. PGPR is reported to stimulate division and enlargement of plant cells that might result in better fusion at graft union point. This investigation was thus conducted to reveal the effects of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (Pseudomonas putida strain BA-8, Bacillus simplex strain T7) on callus formation, graft success, vegetative development and subsequent bud fruitfullness of Alphonse Lavallee grape cultivar. The green softwood shoots of Alphonse Lavallee (AL) grape were grafted on the rootstocks 41 B or 1103 P by modified cleft green-grafting technique in controlled glasshouse. Before grafting, the single scion nodes were divided into four treatment groups. Three of them were separately dipped into bacterial suspension (10(9) CFU ml(-1)) of either of two strains or their combination for an hour. One of the treatment groups was dipped into the tap water (as control). Each treatment has contained thirty grafts, divided into three replicates. In both graft combinations, combined application of BA-8 and T7 strains resulted in 100\% callusing compared with the uninoculated control where the percentages were 93.3 and 90.0\% for AL/41 B and AL/1103 P combinations, respectively. Individual or combined applications of the strains also had remarkably positive influences on full callusing rates. The highest shoot length values were obtained from combined application (113.5 cm) and BA-8 strains (100.9 cm) in AL/41 B and AL/1103 P graft combinations, respectively. Inoculation of the graft scion parts with BA-8 strain resulted in the highest shoot lignification lengths in both AL/41 B and AL/1103 P combinations with the values of 75.4 and 75.6 cm, respectively while uninoculated grafts of the representing combinations were as low as 59.0 and 55.3 cm. In AL/41B, the highest (100\%) graft survival rate in nursery was recorded in plants treated with bacterial combination. Combined application as well as BA-8 performed better in AL/1103P. The findings imply that PGPR can be employed in ecological and sustainable production of nursery material and point to the feasibility of commercially synthetic auxin replacement by PGPR-based ecological treatment.

We evaluated how hydraulic traits of three Prunus avium cultivars grown on the same rootstock are related to tree growth and patterns of biomass allocation between vegetative and reproductive parts as well as total water consumption to determine how water, as a limiting resource for agriculture, might be optimized by choosing appropriate cultivars that are at the same time the most successful from the point of view of fruit production. Bing, Lapins and Van cultivars growing under field- and well-irrigated conditions were selected. Leaf and stem hydraulic conductance (K (Leaf) and k (S)), leaf vulnerability to cavitation, water relations traits, water use and assimilation and growth rates as well as fruit yield were measured. The cultivar with high leaf vulnerability to cavitation and low k (S) and sap flow (Lapins) had low vegetative growth, but larger fruit production compared to the cultivars with higher k (S), resistance to cavitation and water use (Bing and Van). As leaf water potential and k (S) were lower and leaves appeared to be embolized in the cultivar that had lower carbon allocation to vegetative organs during the reproductive period (Lapins), we hypothesize that water instead of moving into the leaves is delivered to the fruits, representing the main sink for water transport. It is possible that increases in the dysfunction of the hydraulic system in the most vulnerable cultivars to cavitation during the reproduction stage (Lapins) may represent a signal for enhancing the delivery of water to fruits. This information related to optimization of crop water use in relation to yield can be useful for selecting cultivars with high yield and low water use. This study also shows that physiological traits of the scions substantially affect growth patterns, fruit production and water relation of the plants.},

The main aim was to develop highly lime tolerant rootstocks, because about half of Hungary's grape growing regions suffer from lime-induced iron chlorosis. The lime content in some of these soils even precludes the use of the Teleki rootstocks. Ease of propagation was also selected for. `Georgikon 28' one of the main/first results of these early efforts. This rootstock has an extremely high lime tolerance and it is easy to propagate, but because of its V. vinifera genetic background its phylloxera resistance is only moderate and needs to be strengthened. As the program progressed drought tolerance was also added to the breeding goals. Seedling populations were established in the mid-1990s after parents had been characterized and selected; their evaluation still continues. The drought tolerance of `Georgikon 28' x `Borner' seedlings is discussed in detail. Field performance of this seedling population was evaluated in a rootstock mother block and in a trial vineyard using standard rootstock cultivars as controls. Results presented are from 2011 and 2012. Both growing season were extremely dry. Harvested cane production in a rootstock mother block was used as an easy and efficient indicator of rootstock productivity to select promising candidates among the seedlings. The performance of grafted plants was judged by the fruit quality (number of clusters, berry size, yield per stock, berry weight, sugar content, acidity) and pruning weight in the vineyard. The most promising genotypes produced higher yield, with better quality in 2012 than the same scions grafted on `1103 Paulsen', `Fercal' or `Georgikon 28' and their cane production were satisfactory as well.},

PRI-1 and RDI-1 vines received similar to 30\% of the crop evapotranspiration (ETc) from budburst to fruit set, 13-15\% from fruit set to veraison and 20\% from veraison to harvest. RDI-2 and PRI-2 vines received around 20\% of ETc from budburst to fruit set, no irrigation from fruit set to veraison, and recovery (21-24\% ETc) thereafter. Compared with RDI-1, PRI-1 increased irrigation depth and total soil water (theta(v)) availability in the root zone, and stimulated greater fine root growth and water uptake. Increased soil volume exploration supported greater canopy water use, vegetative development, biomass accumulation and internal water storage capacity. PRI-1 vines had higher stomatal conductance, lower leaf-level water use efficiency and increased leaf xylem sap concentration ([X-ABA](leaf)) following reirrigation. Compared with RDI-2, PRI-2 decreased total theta(v) availability, fine root growth and water uptake, gas exchange, leaf water status, [X-ABA](leaf), biomass accumulation and storage capacity. Xylem ABA decreased with total theta(v) availability in PRI-2, probably from limited sap flow when theta(v) in drying soil was low (approximate to 20\%). For this rootstock-scion combination, high irrigation volumes applied to the wet part of the roots (theta(v) {\textgreater} 30\%) are critical for increasing root-to-shoot ABA signalling and growth, and improving performance under semiarid conditions.},

The selected vineyards were representative of the variation in salinity-associated soil variables, as well as of leaf and juice element contents previously reported for South African vineyards. Under the prevailing conditions, the four scion-rootstock combinations responded similarly to the salinity-associated variables. The results confirm that soil pH((KCl)) should be at least 6.0 for grapevines. The salinity threshold for vineyards in the Breede River Valley should be between 0.7 dS/m and 1.5 dS/m to avoid growth and yield reductions. To reduce the risk of Na toxicity, the SAR should be below 3, and the soluble Na content in the soil should not exceed 5 mg/kg. If gypsum is used to reduce soil Na, it should be applied judiciously to avoid soil SO4 accumulation, thereby reducing the risk of K and Mg deficiencies. Under the prevailing conditions, B and Cl toxicity apparently contributed to reduced vegetative growth. Therefore, soil Cl and B should be kept as low as possible, but care should be taken that B is not reduced to deficient levels. The boundary line concept proved to be useful for determining the effect of a single salinity-associated soil variable on grapevine response.},

Grapevine rootstocks were developed to provide increased resistance to root disease, but rootstock effects on cane and vine diseases remain unclear. Grapevines that consisted of Cabernet Sauvignon or Chardonnay grafted to 13 different rootstocks were inoculated with Xf and evaluated for PD severity and Xf titer after 6 months. A subset of six rootstock/scion combinations had xylem sap phenolic levels assessed in non-infected and Xf-infected grapevines. Vigor also was analyzed by measuring root lengths and masses. Cabernet Sauvignon grafted to 101-14MG, 1103P 420A, or Schwarzmann had reduced PD severity compared to Cabernet Sauvignon grafted to 110R, 5BB, or SO4. Chardonnay grafted to Salt Creek or Freedom had reduced PD severity compared to Chardonnay grafted to RS3 or Schwarzmann. Chardonnay grafted to RS3 had greater Xf titer than Chardonnay grafted to 101-14MG, Freedom, or Salt Creek. No other differences in Xf titer among rootstocks were observed. Of the six scion/rootstock combinations which had xylem sap phenolics analyzed, Chardonnay/RS3 had the highest levels of most phenolics whereas Cabernet Sauvignon/101-14MG had the lowest phenolic levels. However, Chardonnay/101-14MG, which had mild PD symptoms, had greater sap levels of caftaric acid than other scion/rootstock combinations. Sap levels of caftaric acid, methyl salicylate, a procyanidin trimer, and quinic acid were greater in Xf-infected vs. non-infected grapevines. Chardonnay on 101-14MG or Salt Creek had greater root mass than Chardonnay on RS3. Cabernet Sauvignon on 101-14MG had greater root mass than Cabernet Sauvignon on 110R. These results identified rootstocks with the capacity for reducing PD symptom progression. Rootstocks also were shown to affect Xf titer, xylem sap phenolic levels, and plant vigor.},

Implication on the cell-to-cell component of plant water transport in both rootstock and scion impacted on embolisms formation in roots and on hydraulics of leaves.

Current weed practices include methyl bromide fumigation, preemergence herbicides, hand labor, and multiple tillage operations. As methyl bromide use is phased out due to air quality concerns, and fuel and labor costs continue to increase, herbicides are likely to become even more important for weed management in the nursery industry. Before new herbicides can be registered and used in stonefruit (Prunus sp.) tree nurseries, weed control efficacy and crop safety data are needed under local conditions. Eleven experiments were conducted from 2007 to 2011 in California tree nurseries to evaluate the crop safety of preemergence (PRE) and postemergence (POST-directed) applications of various herbicides on commonly grown peach (Prunus persica), plum (Prunus domestica), and peach/plum hybrid rootstocks budded to almond (Prunus dulcis) scions. Rootstocks grown from cuttings generally were more tolerant to herbicides than those grown from seed. Crop safety was adequate in seeded and vegetatively propagated rootstocks with oryzalin, pendimethalin, and isoxaben, all of which are labeled for use in tree nurseries. The unregistered herbicides, dithiopyr, rimsulfuron, oxyfluorfen, and foramsulfuron; as well as lower rates of indaziflam and penoxsulam; applied PRE and POST-directed can provide good to excellent weed control in some stonefruit rootstocks. However, because slight crop injury was occasionally observed, additional work on application rates, timing, and method of application, especially on nonlabeled herbicides is needed before these materials can be considered for registration and broad scale use in tree nurseries.},

However, little is known about the effect of rootstocks on scion gene expression. The objective of this study was to determine whether hetero-grafting the grapevine variety Vitis vinifera cv. `Cabernet Sauvignon N' with two different rootstocks alters gene expression in the shoot apex in comparison to the auto-grafted control. Cabernet Sauvignon was hetero-grafted with two commercial rootstock genotypes and auto-grafted with itself. Vigor was quantified by measurements of root, stem, leaf and trunk biomass. Gene expression profiling was done using a whole genome grapevine microarray; four pools of five shoot apex samples were harvested 4 months after grafting for each scion/rootstock combination. Results: The rootstocks increased stem biomass or conferred increased vigor by the end of the first growth cycle. Globally hetero-grafting two different genotypes together triggered an increase in shoot apex gene expression; however no genes were differentially expressed between the two hetero-grafts. The functional categories related to DNA, chromatin structure, histones, flavonoids and leucine rich repeat containing receptor kinases were the most enriched in the up-regulated genes in the shoot apex of hetero-grafted plants. Conclusions: The choice of rootstock genotype had little effect on the gene expression in the shoot apex; this could suggest that auto-and hetero-grafting was the major factor regulating gene expression.},

Twenty-six grapevine genotypes were assessed for their tolerance to excess boron under non-saline and saline conditions. Methods and ResultsRootling vines received one of three irrigation treatments: Control (B 0.2mM), Boron (B 0.67mM) or Boron+Salt [B 0.6mM, electrical conductivity 4.0dS/m]. In the Boron treatment, shoot growth ranged from 88 to 14\% of that in the Control, and in the Boron+Salt from 58 to 10\% of that in the Control. Within genotype comparison showed that the growth of shoots in the Boron and Boron+Salt treatments was equivalent in 24 genotypes. Genotype did not affect the leaf B concentration in the Boron treatment. The addition of salinity did not affect the leaf B concentration in 25 genotypes. In 14 genotypes, the leaf Na+ concentration in the Boron treatment was more than double that in the Control. In the Boron and Boron+Salt treatments, shoot growth was not correlated with B concentration in the leaf, and in the Boron+Salt treatment, it was not correlated with Cl- and Na+ concentration in the leaf. Boron and Boron+Salt treatments reduced the leaf photosynthetic rate and the effective quantum yield of photosystem II ((PSII)). ConclusionsThere was a large genotypic variation in the tolerance of growth to excess boron. It could not be attributed to the variation in leaf B concentration. Significance of the StudyThe shoot growth in 1613 Couderc and Vitis acerifolia under excess boron was equivalent to that in the Control treatment, which indicates that the use of these two genotypes as rootstocks may produce vines with an improved tolerance to excess boron.},

	abstract = {Two commercial nurseries located in Comunidad Valenciana region (central-eastern Spain) were sampled in 2010 to evaluate whether the grapevine nursery propagation process could be a source of black-foot disease pathogens. Samples were taken from four sources of the propagation process: pre-grafting hydration tanks, scissors used for cutting buds, omega-cut grafting machines, and peat used for callusing. DNA from these samples was extracted and multiplex nested-PCR using primers specific for “Cylindrocarpon” pauciseptatum, Ilyonectria liriodendri and I. macrodidyma-complex (composed of I. alcacerensis, I. estremocensis, I. macrodidyma, I. novozelandica, I. torresensis, and two undescribed species) was used to identify the species present. Ilyonectria liriodendri and I. macrodidyma-complex were detected in hydration tanks, scissors, grafting machines and peat, I. macrodidyma-complex being the most frequent. Additionally, ten grafted cuttings each from five grapevine scion/rootstock combinations were collected from each nursery immediately after callusing, and again after one growing season in a nursery field. Roots of these grafted cuttings and plants were sampled to isolate the fungal pathogens. Only I. torresensis was isolated after callusing, while I. liriodendri, I. novozelandica and I. torresensis were isolated after one growing season, showing the highest incidence at this latter sampling time. Moreover, DNA was extracted from roots and analyzed as described before. Ilyonectria liriodendri and I. macrodidyma-complex were also detected at both sampling times. The use of the multiplex nested-PCR technique improved the detection of I. liriodendri and I. macrodidyma-complex from grafted cuttings and plants in both nurseries. This work shows that the grapevine nursery propagation process should be considered as a potential infection source for black-foot disease pathogens, and confirms that infections caused by Ilyonectria spp. in grapevine planting material increase markedly after one growing season in nursery fields.},

Two rootstock cultivars, 1103P and 101-14 Mgt, were fertilized with nitrogen during spring or fall or received no treatment. Vine biomass, leaf N concentration, fruit composition, juice amino-N levels, and fermentation kinetics were measured. The rootstock 1103 Paulsen (Vitis berlandieri x V. rupestris cv. 1103P) has a root system that tends to produce large canopies and high shoot growth. The rootstock 101-14 Millardet et de Grasset (V. riparia x V. rupestris cv. 101-14 Mgt) has a root system associated with smaller canopies and moderate shoot growth. The scion Merlot (V. vinifera L. cv. Merlot clone 1) was grafted onto the two rootstocks in an experimental block in Oakville, California. Merlot on 1103P had higher YAN levels and completed fermentation faster compared to Merlot on 101-14 Mgt. Differences in fermentation kinetics were observed within rootstock N treatments that were not explained by YAN levels, indicating that other factors related to N metabolism may play important roles in fermentation dynamics. Results indicated that Merlot grown on 1103P in the Napa Valley may require little to no N supplementation while Merlot on 101-14 Mgt may require N supplementation to avoid slow fermentations.},

Iron deficiency chlorosis is a wide-spread disorder of plants, in particular, of those growing on calcareous soils. Among the different ways to control iron deficiency problems for crops, plant material and especially rootstock breeding is a suitable and reliable method, especially for fruit trees and grapes. The aim of the experiment was to characterize the genetic basis of grapevine chlorosis tolerance under lime stress conditions. A segregating population of 138 F1 genotypes issued from an inter-specific cross between Vitis vinifera Cabernet Sauvignon (tolerant) x V. riparia Gloire de Montpellier (sensitive) was developed and phenotyped both as cuttings and as rootstock grafted with Cabernet Sauvignon scions in pots containing non-chlorosing and chlorosing soils. Tolerance was evaluated by chlorosis score, leaf chlorophyll content and growth parameters of the shoots and roots. The experiments were performed in 2001, 2003 and 2006. The plants analysed in 2006 were reassessed in 2007. The most significant findings of the trial were: (a) the soil properties strongly affect plant development, (b) there are differences in tolerance among segregating genotypes when grown as cuttings or as rootstocks on calcareous soil, (c) calcareous conditions induced chlorosis and revealed quantitative trait loci (QTLs) implicated in polygenic control of tolerance, (d) rootstock strongly contributes to lime-induced chlorosis response, and (e) a QTL with strong effect (from 10 to 25 \% of the chlorotic symptom variance) was identified on chromosome 13. This QTL colocalized with a QTL for chlorophyll content (R (2) = 22 \%) and a major QTL for plant development that explains about 50 \% of both aerial and root system biomass variation. These findings were supported by stable results among the different years of experiment. These results open new insights into the genetic control of chlorosis tolerance and could aid the development of iron chlorosis-tolerant rootstocks.},

In 2011 we obtained valuable differences in the boron, copper, iron, manganese and zinc concentrations of skins of `Cserszegi friszeres' grafted into different rootstocks. The concentrations of B, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn changed between 18.0-32.0 mg kg(-1), between 1.27-4.77 mg kg(-1), between 11.5-45.0 mg kg(-1), between 3.78-14.0 mg kg(-1), and between 2.148.53 mg kg(-1), respectively. On the basis of our results the Riparia Sauvage' could be an advantageous rootstock, as the largest boron, iron and manganese concentrations were found in its skin. Advantageous rootstocks could be the `Berlandieri x Riparia Szilagyi 157 Pecs' because of the largest measured copper content and the `Vitis Berlandieri' due to the largest measured zinc content.

	abstract = {The concentration of potassium (K) and pH in juice of grapevines is influenced by rootstocks (Vitis). However, the performance of rootstocks with respect to berry quality parameters and inter-relationships among berry quality parameters are not well understood. The current study addresses these issues. Berry and leaf samples at harvest maturity were collected from mature field-grown `Shiraz' grapevines grafted with each of the rootstocks Dogridge, Freedom, Ramsey, 1103 Paulsen and 140 Ruggeri. Concentrations of K in juice and petiole and pH in juice were each highest for Dogridge and Freedom, but lowest for 140 Ruggeri and 1103 Paulsen. High concentration of K in juice was related to high concentrations of malic acid and TSS but low tartaric acid/malic acid ratio. In this study, lower concentrations of K in juice and in turn pH in juice of `Shiraz' grapevines were maintained through rootstocks such as 140 Ruggeri and 1103 Paulsen that also show lower concentrations of K in petiole and TSS in juice, and higher tartaric/malic acid concentration ratio in juice at maturity. Selective use of these rootstocks in turn helps to produce quality grape juice and wine.},

	abstract = {Black foot of grapevine is an important disease caused primarily by Ilyonectria spp. and “Cylindrocarpon” pauciseptatum. These pathogens affect grapevine nurseries and young vineyards, causing the decline and death of plants. In the nursery, the primary infections of the grafted cuttings are mainly attributed to soil-borne inoculum, which could infect the roots and the basal end of rootstocks during the rooting stage. The aim of this research was to detect other possible sources of inoculum throughout the different nursery stages by classical and molecular techniques (nested-PCR and multiplex nested-PCR). Results revealed the presence of the I. liriodendri and/or I. macrodidyma complex in grapevine rootstock and scion cuttings, cutting tools, water from hydration tanks, well water, callusing medium, one indoor air sample and soils collected from mother fields and nurseries. “Cylindrocarpon” pauciseptatum was only detected in the callusing medium, nursery soils, rooted-graftlings and on the root pruning machine. Forty four isolates obtained from soils (mother fields and nurseries) and rooted graftlings (six grapevine cultivar/rootstock combinations) were sequenced for part of histone H3 gene to resolve the species. While I. liriodendri, I. macrodidyma and I. torresensis were identified from soil samples, from rooted graftlings it was also possible to detect I. liriodendri, I. macrodidyma, I. novozelandica, I. torresensis, Ilyonectria sp. 2, “C.” pauciseptatum and four Ilyonectria isolates which are close to I. cyclaminicola. The results demonstrated that, in addition to nursery soils, mother field soils, rootstock and scion cuttings, water from wells and hydration tanks, callusing media, cutting tools and indoor air should be considered as potential sources of inoculum for black foot pathogens.},

	abstract = {We studied photosynthetic capacity, growth, sap flow, and water-use efficiency in young trees of `Pink Lady' apple (Malus domestica) that were exposed to 60 d of moisture stress. Three irrigation schemes were tested in the greenhouse: well-watered control; drought; or alternate deficit irrigation (ADI). Compared with the drought-stressed plants, those treated via ADI showed better height growth, larger scion diameters, and greater total leaf area, as well as significantly increased gains in dry biomass and rootstock diameters. However, their performance was still significantly lower than that demonstrated by continuously well-watered plants. Sap flow was greater under ADI than under drought, but less than under control conditions. The average rate of net photosynthesis, total amount of irrigation water applied, and dry biomass gain had highly significant and positive linear correlations with long-term water-use efficiency (WUEL). The same was true between average stomatal conductance and WUEL. By contrast, instantaneous water-use efficiency (WUEI) was very significantly and negatively correlated with WUEL. In addition, values for WUEL were much higher from well-watered plants when compared with either drought-stressed trees or those treated per ADI. Therefore, our results indicate that, although `Pink Lady' apple normally has high WUE, it still consumes a large amount of water. Therefore, the practice of ADI following a period of long-term drought could be used to improve growth and WUEL by this cultivar.},

	abstract = {Vitis vinifera scions are commonly grafted onto rootstocks of other grape species to influence scion vigour and provide resistance to soil-borne pests and abiotic stress; however, the mechanisms by which rootstocks affect scion physiology remain unknown. This study characterized the hydraulic physiology of Vitis rootstocks that vary in vigour classification by investigating aquaporin (VvPIP) gene expression, fine-root hydraulic conductivity (Lp(r)), \% aquaporin contribution to Lp(r), scion transpiration, and the size of root systems. Expression of several VvPIP genes was consistently greater in higher-vigour rootstocks under favourable growing conditions in a variety of media and in root tips compared to mature fine roots. Similar to VvPIP expression patterns, fine-root Lp(r) and \% aquaporin contribution to Lp(r) determined under both osmotic (Lp(r)(Osm)) and hydrostatic (Lp(r)(Hyd)) pressure gradients were consistently greater in high-vigour rootstocks. Interestingly, the \% aquaporin contribution was nearly identical for Lp(r)(Osm) and Lp(r)(Hyd) even though a hydrostatic gradient would induce a predominant flow across the apoplastic pathway. In common scion greenhouse experiments, leaf area-specific transpiration (E) and total leaf area increased with rootstock vigour and were positively correlated with fine-root Lp(r). These results suggest that increased canopy water demands for scion grafted onto high-vigour rootstocks are matched by adjustments in root-system hydraulic conductivity through the combination of fine-root Lp(r) and increased root surface area.},

Phenology of Xylella fastidiosa and its vector around California almond nurseries: An assessment of plant vulnerability to almond leaf scorch disease. Plant Dis. 96:1488-1494. Management of almond leaf scorch disease requires knowledge of all possible infection pathways. The disease is caused by the xylem-limited bacterium Xylella fastidiosa, which is transmitted by several species of sharpshooters. The objectives of this research were to elucidate the fate of bacteria in planta after inoculations in almond nursery plants and to determine patterns of insect vector population dynamics and temporal distribution of X. fastidiosa infected plants relative to host plant assemblages in habitats surrounding commercial nurseries. In an experimental nursery, disease incidence was markedly affected by rootstock type. Prior to bud grafting, `Nemaguard' rootstock seedlings were not susceptible to bacterial infection. After bud grafting with a susceptible scion ('Sonora'), scions were susceptible to infection regardless of rootstock genotype. Surveys near commercial nurseries revealed that only habitats with permanent grass cover sustained vector populations throughout the season. A total of 87 plant samples tested positive for X. fastidiosa (6.3\%) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), with a higher number of X. fastidiosa infected plants found in weedy alfalfa fields than in other habitat types. Among plant species infected by X. fastidiosa, 33\% were winter annuals, 45\% were biennials or perennials, and 22\% were summer annuals. Collectively, these findings identified a potential pathway for X. fastidiosa infection of almonds in nursery situations.},

Understanding the spatial organization of the graft interface is important to the evaluation of new rootstock genotypes and to the development of new grafting technologies. Until now the graft interface has only been studied using 2D classical histology and low resolution 3D magnetic resonance imaging. Here we investigate the ability of X-ray tomography to examine the graft interface of Vitis vinifera in high resolution and in 3D. Data were collected using a Skyscan 1076, scanning parameters, such as. X-ray energy, filter selection, pixel size and rotation angles, were optimized to study the particularities of the graft interface. The X-ray tomography technique was then used to evaluate graft quality. Two young vines were compared; one graft was classified as of `good' quality, whereas the other was classified as of `bad' quality. We were able to distinguish the “omega cut”, the pith, the phloem and the xylem vessels in the images. The analysis shows several differences between the two vines. In the good graft, tissues appear well-connected in the wood and phloem, and had a regular structure; the wood appears homogenous with a lot of vessels that form a compact mass. By contrast, in the bad graft, the structures appear disorganized and not completely connected. Numerous new vessels, continuous between the scion and the rootstock, are visible in the “good graft” whereas only few ones are visible in the “bad one”. It is the first time, to our knowledge, that 3D imaging of the graft interface and the vascular connections across it have been reported, opening new avenues for graft quality assessment in woody plants.

Raf.], citrumelos (C. paradisi x P. trifoliata), mandarins (C. reticulata Blanco) and various hybrids, in three or six replicates of three-tree plots in a randomized complete block design. Tree growth and survival, yield, and juice quality were measured annually or periodically for 10 years. In three seasons, whole-tree crops were sized in the field. Using the fruit size distribution data, crop value or income/tree was estimated. Tree height after 10 years ranged from 1.7 to 4.1 in and survival was greater than 90\% with a few exceptions. Mean cumulative yield was 1202 kg/tree and ranged from 649 (Hamlin + Flying Dragon trifoliate orange) to 1615 kg/tree for a hybrid of trifoliate orange x At tree age 9 years, mean soluble solids production was 3594 kg.ha(-1) with a 240\% difference between the lowest and highest value. There were differences in the distribution of four commercial-sized categories based on analysis of individual sizes and using PROC FREQ to examine and compare whole-tree distributions. When the yield and fruit size data were combined for 3 years and converted to income/tree using commercial Florida Freight On Board prices in November and March, the trees on a trifoliate orange x Milam hybrid (1584) had the highest estimated income ({\textbackslash}354 U.S., March data) followed by Calamandarin ({\textbackslash}321) and Norton citrange ({\textbackslash}292). The lowest income/tree was {\textbackslash}112 (Hamlin + Flying Dragon trifoliate orange).

Transgrafting combines horticultural grafting practices with modern GE methods for crop improvement. Here, a non-GE conventional scion (upper stem portion) is grafted onto a transgenic GE rootstock. Thus, the scion does not contain the genetic modification present in the rootstock genome. We examined transgene presence in walnut and tomato GE rootstocks and non-GE fruit-bearing scions. Mobilization of transgene DNA, protein, and mRNA across the graft was not detected. Though transgenic siRNA mobilization was not observed in grafted tomatoes or walnut scions, transgenic siRNA signal was detected in walnut kernels. Prospective benefits from transgrafted plants include minimized risk of GE pollen flow (Lev-Yadun and Sederoff, 2001), possible use of more than one scion per approved GE rootstock which could help curb the estimated US\$ 136 million (CropLife International, 2011) cost to bring a GE crop to international markets, as well as potential for improved consumer and market acceptance since the consumable product is not itself GE.

Treatments included low (280 mm of irrigation and rainfall), medium (780 mm) and high (1300 mm) application amounts, each with frequencies of 1,2 and 4-weekly. Despite artificial drainage, there was a watertable of variable depth: its effect was evaluated by grouping plots into those with shallow ({\textless}2.2 m depth) or deep ({\textgreater}2.2 m depth) watertables. Treatments were applied to grapevines with Sultana scions grafted to Ramsey rootstocks and own-rooted Sultana vines. Yields from vines grafted to Ramsey were largely unchanged by irrigation treatments even where shallow watertables resulted in high soil salinities (ECe {\textgreater} 3.0 dS m(-1)), probably because of the capacity of Ramsey rootstock to exclude chloride ions. For vines on their own roots, there were interactions between irrigation frequency and watertable depth for soil salinity and yield, with the fortnightly frequency offering the best compromise where there was a shallow watertable. The response to irrigation amount also depended on watertable depth; the low amount reduced yield relative to that in the medium and high amounts in areas where the watertable was deep but not in areas where it was shallow. Yield in the medium and high amounts tended to be lower in areas where the water table was shallow compared with areas where it was deep. The results suggest that where shallow watertables are present irrigation management should be modified for both own-rooted and Ramsey grafted Sultanas to apply no more than moderate amounts of irrigation and preferably at not less than fortnightly intervals.

The global citrus industry is in urgent need of effective chemical treatments for HLB control because of its rapid spreading worldwide. Due to the fastidious nature of the pathogens, and the poor permissibility of citrus leaf surfaces, effective screening of chemicals for the HLB control can be challenging. In this study, we developed a graft-based chemotherapy method to rapidly screen potential HLB-controlling chemical compounds. In addition, we improved transmission efficiency by using the best HLB-affected scion rootstock combination, and demonstrated the HLB bacterial titer was the critical factor in transmission. The HLB-affected lemon scions had a high titer of HLB bacterium, survival rate (83.3\%), and pathogen transmission rate (59.9\%). Trifoliate, a widely used commercial rootstock, had the highest survival rate ({\textgreater}70.0\%) compared with grapefruit (52.6\%) and sour orange (50.4\%). Using this method, we confirmed a mixture of penicillin and streptomycin was the most effective compounds in eliminating the HLB bacterium from the HLB-affected scions, and in successfully rescuing severely HLB-affected citrus germ-plasms. These findings are useful not only for chemical treatments but also for graft-based transmission studies in HLB and other Liberibacter diseases.},

After 10 d without stress, the water supply was progressively limited over a period of 10 d, and a stable water deficit was then applied for 15 d. Transpiration rate was estimated daily and a mathematical curve was fitted to its response to water deficit intensity. We also determined delta C-13 values in leaves, transpiration efficiency and water extraction capacity. These traits were then analysed in a multienvironment (year and water status) quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis. Quantitative trait loci, independent of year and water status, were detected for each trait. One genomic region was specifically implicated in the acclimation of scion transpiration induced by the rootstock. The QTLs identified colocalized with genes involved in water deficit responses, such as those relating to ABA and hydraulic regulation. Scion transpiration rate and its acclimation to water deficit are thus controlled genetically by the rootstock, through different genetic architectures.},

	abstract = {Aims: Esca disease of grapevine is characterised by foliar symptoms associated with the development of various internal wood necroses. The aims of the present study are to determine the type and the quantity of necroses in the various woody compartments of vines, the relationships between them and the links between necroses and severity of foliar symptoms. Methods and results: Symptomatic and asymptomatic vines cv Cabernet-Sauvignon were cross-sectioned to quantify the different types of internal necrosis in the scions (cordons, heads, and trunks) and rootstocks. Five necrosis “variables” were accounted for: central necrosis, sectorial necrosis, mixed necrosis, white rot, altered perimeter and in addition to the variable healing cone. In the scion, for all types of necrosis variables, a significant correlation between compartments was found. Vines with acute foliar form of esca had very advanced peripheral tissue degradations in the xylem and cambial zones. Chronic foliar expression of esca was associated with quantity of internal necroses higher than those obtained for asymptomatic vines. A logistic model indicated that white rot in the cordons was the best predictor for the chronic form of esca. Conclusion: Necroses formed a continuum within the plant. The scion is like a single unit with a volume of necroses useful to determine the health status of vines. Significance and impact or the study: A quantitative analysis of vine internal necroses would open up new possibilities for esca-epidemic approaches.},

At harvest, two field replicates each were combined to make five winemaking replicates; 45 kg of grapes were made into wine. The grape variables measured were total soluble solids (TSS), titratable acidity (TA), pH, potassium (skin, seeds and pulp), tannins (skin and seeds), and anthocyanins. Wine variables measured were ethanol, TA, pH, potassium, tannins, total iron reactive phenolics, anthocyanins, and polymeric pigments. Rootstock caused few significant differences in fruit and wine composition and instead the dominant factors were scion and, to a lesser extent, vintage. All fruit and wine variables measured with the exception of TSS varied significantly with scion. Only TSS and berry size were consistently affected by vintage. Rootstock had no effect on grape anthocyanins and tannins. However, significant but small and variable effects were observed for wine anthocyanins and tannins. Wines from own-rooted vines tended to have somewhat higher pH, potassium, and total tannin than did wines from grafted vines. The relationships between fruit and wine for anthocyanins and tannins were not straightforward and warrant further research.},

Riparia Gloire de Montpellier and Vitis berlandieri x V. rupestris cv. 1103 Paulsen was studied in young plants grown in pots trained to one stem in two experiments. Stem elongation and phytomer emergence were studied from grafting until the end of the growth season. The elongation of the Cabernet Sauvignon N leaves, tendrils and internodes of each phytomer along the stem was fitted using sigmoid curves. The rootstocks studied slightly altered the growth dynamics of the leaves, internodes and tendrils of the scion. This is the first study to examine the effect of rootstocks on shoot growth dynamics in any species. The alterations in primary growth were small, suggesting that rootstocks may alter scion biomass principally by modifying secondary growth.},

In central Florida, seedlings of 10 rootstocks and trees of 8 scion cultivars were evaluated for canker after being established for 9 to 18 months in a trial of nonbearing trees planted adjacent to young grapefruit trees that were highly infected with citrus canker. All rootstocks and scions were susceptible to foliar citrus canker to varying degrees. Rootstocks were ranked as predicted by the known susceptibility of the parental genotypes to citrus canker. Swingle citrumelo (trifoliate hybrid with grapefruit) was the most susceptible, followed by Carrizo and Kuharske citrange (trifoliate hybrid with sweet orange), and sour orange (pummelo parentage). Seedlings of X639, US812, and US897 (trifoliate hybrids of Cleopatra mandarin or Sunki) were moderately susceptible. Volkamer lemon, Cleopatra mandarin, and Kinkoji leaves were the least susceptible rootstocks. Within the scion varieties, `Minneola' tangelo, `Murcott' tangor, `Valencia', `Fallglo' tangerine, `Sunburst' tangerine, and `Orlando' tangelo exhibited low susceptibility. `Ponkan' (mandarin hybrid) and `Satsuma' mandarin were the least susceptible of the scion varieties.},

	abstract = {Grapes are grown worldwide, on about 7.9 million ha, and are used to produce wine, raisins, juice, jam, concentrate, and seed oils, as well as fresh fruit. Grapes (Vitis sp.) are members of the Vitaceae. Vitis includes two subgenera, Euvitis (38 chromosomes) and Muscadinia (40 chromosomes), with about 60 species in total. The primary centers of species diversity are North America and East Asia. Scion cultivars are derived chiefly from the European grape, Vitis vinifera, which was domesticated ca. 6,000-10,000 years ago in the region between the Black and Caspian Seas. Grapes spread east into Asia and west into the Mediterranean region. Rootstocks were developed from North American species, including V. riparia, V. rupestris, and V. berlandieri. Scion breeding programs focus on the development of cultivars adapted to biotic and abiotic stress, with high fruit quality, and time of ripening during desirable periods of market demand. Fungal disease resistance is a primary goal of many programs, while cold hardy cultivars help extend the limits of grape cultivation. Rootstock breeding focuses on providing protection against phylloxera and nematodes as well as adaptation to high pH, low pH, and/or water-stressed conditions. Rootstocks should propagate easily by grafting and cuttings. New cultivars are more rapidly adapted in the raisin and table grape sectors than in the wine industry, although there are several notable examples of successful wine grape cultivars developed by breeding. The availability of two published genomic DNA sequences has stimulated numerous projects to further understand the function of the ca. 30,000 grapevine genes. Marker-assisted selection, primarily for disease resistance and seedlessness, is being applied in many breeding programs. Projects that focus on breeding seedless cultivars commonly use embryo rescue techniques, enabling the crossing of two seedless parents, to increase the percentage of seedlings that are seedless. Genetic transformation is a routine procedure and is being used for both functional analysis of gene action as well as directly for cultivar improvement (both scions and rootstocks), although transgenic grape cultivars currently are not in commercial production.},

Vines were grown on their own roots or field-grafted to the rootstocks 5C, 99R, 140Ru, 1103P, 3309C, and an unnamed rootstock from Cornell University (here termed 101CU) that is a likely sibling or seedling of 101-14 Mgt. Repeated scion dieback due to cold injury to 99R led us to abandon this rootstock. Vine phenology, vigor, water status, yield formation, and fruit ripening and composition were evaluated during three years beginning in the vineyard's ninth year. Own-rooted Merlot and Chardonnay grew more shoots than grafted vines, and 140Ru and 1103P tended to reduce pruning weights. However, 3309C was the rootstock associated with the highest pruning weights in Syrah and the lowest in Chardonnay. Rootstocks usually did not impact vine phenology, fruit set, and plant water status, although there was a trend for stem water potential to be highest with 3309C and lowest with 5C. The rootstock effect on yield formation depended on the scion cultivar, and variations in different yield components often cancelled out each other, but 3309C (Merlot and Syrah), 5C (Merlot and Chardonnay), and own roots (Chardonnay) were often associated with high yields. Nevertheless, the rootstocks had only minor effects on fruit ripening and did not consistently alter soluble solids, TA, K+, or anthocyanin pigments, but the pH was higher in fruit from own-rooted vines compared with grafted Merlot and Chardonnay. Overall, scion effects and differences due to yearly climate variation far outweighed any differences due to rootstock.},

	abstract = {Citrus is the most extensively produced tree fruit crop in the world. There are two clearly differentiated markets: the fresh fruit and the processed juice market. Citrus species are essentially diploids (2n = 2x = 18) and were domesticated in Southeast Asia several thousand years ago and then spread throughout the world. Most of the cultivated citrus species are part of the Citrus genus containing, depending on the taxonomist, between 16 and 156 species. The relative complexity of these classifications results from the conjunction of a broad morphological diversity, total sexual interspecific compatibility within the genus and apomixis. There are four basic taxa on the basis of morphological descriptors and molecular data (C. maxima (Burm.) Merr., the pummelos; C. medica L., the citrons, C. reticulata Blanco, the andarins, and C. micrantha Wester). The other cultivated species (C. aurantium L., the sour orange; C. sinensis (L.) Osbeck, the sweet orange; C. paradisi Macf, the grapefruit; C. limon (L.) Burm. f., the lemon, and C. aurantifolia (Christm.) Swingle, the lime) appeared by recombination among the basic taxa. Most of the citrus scion cultivars result from the selection of spontaneous bud mutations identified in production orchards. Today several projects of ploidy manipulation are developed in different countries to select seedless triploid mandarins. Fruit quality (size, color, easy-peeling), seedlessness, and the extension of the harvest season are the main selection objectives for fresh market cultivars. The majority of the rootstocks used for propagation are original species or ancient natural hybrids. However, intergeneric hybrids (Citrus x Poncirus) such as citranges, citrumelos, and citrandarins have an increasing importance. The first rootstock breeding objective is adaptation to soil conditions and soil pathogens. The most widespread needs would be tolerance to CTV. Biotechnology is strongly integrated into breeding and propagation schemes. Shoot tip grafting is widely used for sanitation of the mother plants in certification propagation schemes. Somatic hybridization is an effective tool used for scion and rootstock breeding. Functional genomics studies ESTs, microarray platforms, and a full genonne sequence are available. Efficient and reliable transformation systems for several economically important citrus species exist.},

Vitis vinifera L. `Cabernet Sauvignon' and `Kekfrankos' scion wood was bench-grafted on `Teleki 5C', `Teleki Kober 5BB', `Teleki Fuhr SO4', `Fercal' and `Georgikon 28' rootstocks.

Vineyard establishment, trellis systems, and cultural practices were standardized among the blocks and years. The soil conditions were the same, but the three years were different in heat summation and precipitation. The two cultivars had different yield production, sugar collection and total acid content independent of the rootstock effect. The greatest benefits of using rootstocks were seen in 2007, where extreme dry weather conditions hit the vineyards and the yields from `Cabernet sauvignon' increased 30\% on `SO4' and 19\% on `Georgikon 28', yields from `Kekfrankos' increased 11\% on `SO4' and `Fercal'. In addition to yield effects, grafting combinations with `Teleki 5C' on `Cabernet sauvignon' and `Georgikon 28' on `Kekfrankos' had greater sugar accumulation. Both scion cultivars had the highest phenolic compound concentrations in both years (anthocyanin, proanthocyanin and catechin) grafted on `Teleki Kober 5BB'. Our results demonstrate that rootstock choice had a significant effect on fruit characteristics of both scion cultivars, especially under drought stress.},

In rare cases, a new somatic hybrid may have direct utility as an improved scion or rootstock cultivar; however, the most important application of somatic hybridization is the building of novel germplasm as a source of elite breeding parents for various types of conventional crosses. Somatic hybridization is beginning to have a major impact on our scion improvement program by the generation of superior allotetraploid breeding parents for use in interploid crosses to generate seedless triploids. Seedlessness is a primary breeding objective for new fresh fruit citrus cultivars, and hundreds of triploid hybrids have been produced using somatic hybrids as the tetraploid parent. Triploid progeny from such crosses are beginning to fruit, and superior seedless selections are being made for mandarin, pummelo/grapefruit, and acid fruit (lemon/lime) improvement; examples of each will be provided. Characterization and selection of parents for interploid crosses is also impacting other important traits including thorniness, disease resistance and cold-hardiness. Successful somatic hybridization in citrus rootstock improvement has allowed for the creation of a rootstock breeding program at the tetraploid level that achieves maximum genetic diversity in zygotic progeny and has great potential for tree size control via polyploidy. Tree size control has gained importance as a means of reducing harvesting costs, maximizing the efficiency of modern cold protection methodology, and facilitating the adaptation of new fruit production systems that feature high density plantings and open hydroponics. Rootstock breeding at the tetraploid level facilitates the packaging of the many required traits for an improved rootstock into individual hybrids, including wide adaptation to diverse soil and environmental conditions, ability to consistently produce high yields of quality fruit, and especially disease and insect resistance. Recent progress and successful examples of these applications will be discussed. Continued feedback from field trials of both scion and rootstock somatic hybrids and their progeny is facilitating the identification of superior breeding parents and cross combinations, thereby accelerating the development of improved citrus cultivars.},

	abstract = {In California, a novel closterovirus was detected in “Redglobe” grapevine, associated with graft incompatibility and given a trivial name “Grapevine rootstock stem lesion associated virus (GRSLaV).” The biological properties of the putative virus were ascertained when asymptomatic yet infected Redglobe scion buds were graft-inoculated onto test plants of Cabernet Sauvignon propagated on 18 different rootstocks. It proved lethal on test plants growing on rootstocks 1616C, 5BB, 5C, 3309C, and 1103 P, whereas latent infections occurred on the remaining scion-rootstock combinations. In contrast, GLRaV-2 type (type strain) produced only typical leafroll symptoms. In a different experiment, GLRaV-2 type was successfully sap-transmitted to N. benthamiana, whereas sap transmission of GRSLaV was unsuccessful. Double-stranded RNA was extracted from infected Redglobe grapevines, cloned, sequenced, and determined a genome length of 16,527 nucleotides. Computer-assisted analysis of open-reading frames (ORFs) revealed a genome organization typical of monopartite viruses in the genus Closterovirus with nine ORFs (range 71-79\% identity) with GLRaV-2 type, the closest similar virus species within the family Closteroviridae. Also the 3'-UTR of GRSLaV consisted of 223 nucleotides with an extended oligo(A) tract similar to that of GLRaV-2 type, Beet yellow stunt virus, and Beet yellows virus. Recombinant GRSLaV coat protein was expressed in E. coli, purified, and immunized a rabbit to produce polyclonal antiserum. Serological data matched the molecular data, whereby exposed plant tissue extracts of grapevines infected by both viruses (GRSLaV and GLRaV-2) reacted positively with homologous and heterologous viral antisera but not with healthy grapevine extracts in ELISA and Western blot tests. Based on the comparative sequence data and shared antigens, GRSLaV is now considered a strain of GLRaV-2 and redesignated as Grapevine leafroll associated virus-2 Redglobe (GLRaV-2RG). Primers specific for GLRaV-2RG were developed, which did not amplify GLRaV-2 type strain. When both sets of specific primers were used in assays of different grapevine collections, the incidence of the respective viruses varied considerably, e.g., 1.7 and 13.5\%, respectively, for GLRaV-2RG and GLRaV-2 type.},

The objective was to find rootstocks to replace sour orange (C. aurantium L.) because of losses to citrus tristeza virus, and to replace Swingle citrumelo [C. paradisi x Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf.] because of its limited usefulness in certain poorly drained coastal sites. The trials were conducted in randomized complete blocks with 12 single-tree replicates spaced 4.6 x 6.9 m. The soils were of the Wabasso and Riviera series. The first trial consisted largely of trees on citrange [C. sinensis (L.) Osb. x P. trifiliata] and citrumelo rootstocks, `Cipo' sweet orange (C. sinensis), and various hybrid rootstocks. The second trial involved mandarin rootstocks (C. reticulata Blanco) and sour orange and related rootstocks. Trees were grown for 7 years and yield and juice quality data were collected for the last 4 years of that period. Those rootstocks identified as the most promising, based on combinations of smaller tree size and high productivity and juice quality, were two Sunki mandarin x Swingle trifoliate orange (TF) hybrids (C-54, C-146), a Sunki mandarin x Flying Dragon TF hybrid, C-35 citrange, and a Cleopatra mandarin x Rubidoux TF hybrid (x639). The trees on these five rootstocks cropped well leading to soluble solids (SS) values of 3000 to 4000 kg/ha when they were 7-years old. The trees on C-54 and C-146 were relatively large, somewhat taller than trees on sour orange, whereas those on C-35 and the Sunki x Flying Dragon hybrid were smaller and similar to sour orange in tree height. Fruit quality among the trees on C-35 and the Sunki x Flying Dragon hybrid had relatively high SS concentration (better than sour orange), and the other three rootstocks had relatively lower solids concentration (poorer than sour orange). The trees on C-35 and the Sunki x Flying Dragon hybrid would be good candidates for higher density orchards.},

	abstract = {Aims: A trial of cv. Malbec grafted to six different rootstocks (Harmony. SO4, 1103 P. 140 Ru, 3309 C and Cereza) and own rooted cv. Malbec (ORMa) was carried out with the aim to study the influence of rootstock on the vegetative and reproductive performance of cv. Malbec. Another objective was to study the relationship between below ground (i.e., rootstock) and above ground (i.e., scion) growth under irrigated conditions, typical of Argentine viticulture. Methods and results: Four groups of rootstocks could be distinguished according to their vegetative and reproductive performance. The first group (Cereza and 3309 C, as ORMa) showed intermediate yield and high vegetative expression (V E). The second group (SO4 and 1103 P) was characterized by high yield and intermediate VE. The third group (140 Ru) displayed intermediate yield and low YE. Finally, the fourth group (Harmony) showed low yield and low YE. 140 Ru showed the highest number of roots, while 1103 P. SO4 and Harmony showed the lowest number. Harmony showed a greater skin to berry ratio than 1103 P and a lower berry weight (1.56 g) than the rest of the treatments (1.7 g on average). Conclusion: Rootstocks influenced the biomass partitioning between leaves, grapes and roots: 140 Ru promoted root and reproductive development; Cereza. 3309 C and ORMa promoted vegetative development; SO4 and 1103 P promoted grape yield; and Harmony promoted root development. Significance and impact of the study: The absence of a general behavior pattern highlights the need to accurately assess the performance of each rootstock for each zone and each Vitis variety, in order to choose the most appropriate scion-rootstock combination.},

The cultivar evaluated was the Cabernet Sauvingon grafted on Paulsen 1103 (V. berlandieri x V. rupestris), Couderc 3309 and 101-14 Mgt (V. riparia x V. rupestris), the training systems evaluated were vertical shoot positioning trellis and Y trellis. The plants were five years old and the spacing was 3,0 x 1,5 m. The experiment was evaluated at the seasons 2007/08 and 2008/09. The experimental design was randomized blocks, with four blocks and 20 plants per plot. The variables analysed were leaf area, productivity, Ravaz index, pruning weight, weight and diameter of the berries, cluster weight, number of berries per cluster, soluble solids contents, total acidity, pH, anthocyanins contents, total polyphenols index and tannins. Plants grafted on 1103P presented the lowest productivity and biggest leaf area. The cultivar Couderc 3309 is the less vigorous rootstock, produces heavier berries and interferes positively on fruit set when increases the number of berries per cluster and berry weight. The rootstocks Paulsen 1103 and 101-14 Mgt, presents the best results for total anthocyanins contents.},

	abstract = {Salinity affects grapevine growth and production when salt concentration in the plant organs increases to levels that interfere with physiological activities. Petiole analysis is a more sensitive indicator of sodium and chloride than blade or whole-leaf analysis. Salinity is caused by high salt concentrations in the root zone that may be due to, among others, saline irrigation water. Other factors that are mostly associated with warm climates are an elevated saline water table or environmental conditions inducing high evaporation. Drip is the most appropriate irrigation method for saline conditions due to its positive interaction with soil aeration and mineral distribution in the onion-shaped irrigated root zone. American hybrid rootstocks tested in the Negev desert of Israel, among them Salt Creek and 140 Ruggeri, showed higher resistance to salinity due to their ability to limit the salt's movement into the scion of several Vinifera cultivars and thereby maintain lower Na and Cl concentrations in the leaves and fruits. Following several successive drought years, water sources in Israel, in both water reservoirs and underground aquifers, have been diminished and the salinity level has increased. Conditions of negative water balance in which precipitation decreases and evaporative demand increases, and consumption by increasing population and agricultural production, lead to the unavoidable solution - water desalination. Recent developments in membrane technology have enabled the use of reverse osmosis at a cost that is only slightly higher than current practices. This ongoing project is aimed at desalinating sea water for human consumption, and purifying and desalinating effluents for agricultural and industrial use. This plan will solve present and future supply scarcity, and maintain high water quality while preserving and improving the environment and recovering the above and underground aquifers.},

	volume = {50},
	issn = {0042-7500},
	abstract = {In warm irrigated regions of Australia (such as Sunraysia), pH of grape juice often tends to be high (e.g. {\textgreater} 3.8). A high juice pH is undesirable for the production of quality wines as it results in wines of low quality for example, reduced colour stability and poor taste. Such a high juice pH is typically associated with a high concentration of K in the juice, depending on the scion, rootstock and location. Potassium is an essential nutrient and plant genotypes, including grapevines, differ in the accumulation of K in plant and/or plant parts. This difference in the accumulation of K by genotypes can be exploited to manipulate the concentration and content of K in plants, berries in particular for example, through selection and use of low K accumulating rootstocks to overcome the high pH affects. This paper briefly reviews the effects of juice pH and K on juice and wine quality, and the role and effect of rootstocks in the regulation of K in grapevine. This will provide a basic knowledge about the current research and key future research needed for the maintenance of acceptable quality of grape juice and wine through use of rootstocks.},

	doi = {10.1093/jxb/erq247},
	abstract = {The role of root systems in drought tolerance is a subject of very limited information compared with above-ground responses. Adjustments to the ability of roots to supply water relative to shoot transpiration demand is proposed as a major means for woody perennial plants to tolerate drought, and is often expressed as changes in the ratios of leaf to root area (A(L):A(R)). Seasonal root proliferation in a directed manner could increase the water supply function of roots independent of total root area (A(R)) and represents a mechanism whereby water supply to demand could be increased. To address this issue, seasonal root proliferation, stomatal conductance (g(s)) and whole root system hydraulic conductance (k(r)) were investigated for a drought-tolerant grape root system (Vitis berlandierixV. rupestris cv. 1103P) and a non-drought-tolerant root system (Vitis ripariaxV. rupestris cv. 101-14Mgt), upon which had been grafted the same drought-sensitive clone of Vitis vinifera cv. Merlot. Leaf water potentials (epsilon(L)) for Merlot grafted onto the 1103P root system (-0.91 +/- 0.02 MPa) were +0.15 MPa higher than Merlot on 101-14Mgt (-1.06 +/- 0.03 MPa) during spring, but dropped by approximately -0.4 MPa from spring to autumn, and were significantly lower by -0.15 MPa (-1.43 +/- 0.02 MPa) than for Merlot on 101-14Mgt (at -1.28 +/- 0.02 MPa). Surprisingly, g(s) of Merlot on the drought-tolerant root system (1103P) was less down-regulated and canopies maintained evaporative fluxes ranging from 35-20 mmol vine(-1) s(-1) during the diurnal peak from spring to autumn, respectively, three times greater than those measured for Merlot on the drought-sensitive rootstock 101-14Mgt. The drought-tolerant root system grew more roots at depth during the warm summer dry period, and the whole root system conductance (k(r)) increased from 0.004 to 0.009 kg MPa-1 s(-1) during that same time period. The changes in k(r) could not be explained by xylem anatomy or conductivity changes of individual root segments. Thus, the manner in which drought tolerance was conveyed to the drought-sensitive clone appeared to arise from deep root proliferation during the hottest and driest part of the season, rather than through changes in xylem structure, xylem density or stomatal regulation. This information can be useful to growers on a site-specific basis in selecting rootstocks for grape clonal material (scions) grafted to them.},

As a relatively new crop in the Brazilian semi-arid region, first research results about irrigation scheduling or strategies in wine grapes are recent. Irrigation strategies as deficit irrigation, regulated deficit irrigation and partial rootzone drying have been evaluated. Therefore, research efforts in the Brazilian semi-arid region should be addressed to water consumption by scion/rootstock varieties, as well as ecophysiological behavior, berry and wine characteristics influenced by water management, according to local edaphic and climatic conditions.},

The canopy volume (CV) of 13-year-old navel orange trees (Citrus sinensis) on Poncirus trifoliata rootstock treated with TsnRNA-IIIb (syn. Citrus dwarfing viroid) was reduced by 45\% and 53.5\% in standard-density (6 m x 6.7 m) or high-density (3 m x 6.7 m) plantings, respectively. The total yield of eight consecutive harvests was not affected significantly by the TsnRNA-IIIb treatments or the two planting densities. However, the yield per land surface unit (Y/LSU) was almost doubled (increased by 97.5\%) for the high-density plantings over the standard-density plantings of the untreated controls. The Y/LSU of the TsnRNA-IIIb treated navel orange trees in the standard-density planting was reduced by 32.7\%. The TsnRNA-IIIb treatment in both planting densities concentrated significantly more fruit production (approximately 60\%) in the economically advantageous middle canopy height zone (0.6-2.4 m) in comparison with the untreated controls (35\%). Fruit grade, size, appearance, organoleptic characteristics or time of maturation of the TsnRNA-IIIb dwarfed navel trees were not significantly different between the two planting densities and the controls. Fruit with higher commercial value was produced in the TsnRNA-IIIb dwarfed navel trees in the high-density planting by 3.9\% and 4.6\% over the TsnRNA-IIIb or controls in standard-density planting respectively. The increase in Y/LSU and fruit value for the TsnRNA-IIIb treated navel trees in the high-density plantings in combination with the reduced management cost of dwarfed trees could result in substantial higher profits for a commercial grove despite the higher establishment cost of high-density plantings.},

Aerial rooting of grapes has not been previously reported in Oklahoma; therefore, quantitative counts of aerial rooting were performed to determine if there was a relationship between aerial root formation and subsequent vine productivity. Aerial root production varied by scion cultivar and the effect of rootstock was unclear. Only Petit Verdot produced significantly more roots on a rootstock than not. It appears that the formation of aerial roots on grapevines in situ is a complex interaction of freeze injury and subsequent environmental conditions to produce roots. Aerial rooting was likely a sign of injury, but the number of aerial roots produced did not necessarily represent the degree of injury. Few or no roots may be produced when injury or damage is slight, more with moderate injury or damage, and few again when significant injury or damage is sustained.},

	abstract = {The occurrence of Phaeomoniella chlamydospora was investigated during vine propagation in an Italian nursery, and combined hot water (HWT) and cyproconazole treatments were carried out to limit the spread of the fungus in nursery vines. In the three-year period 2005-2007, cutting and graft samples (scion cv. Sangiovese, rootstock cv. 140Ru in 2005 and 1103P in 2006-2007) were taken during propagation at several infection risk stages, and the occurrence of P. chlamydospora was assessed by nested PCR. In 2005 and 2006, cuttings from esca-symptomatic grapevines (scion cv. Sauvignon blanc, rootstock cv. 140Ru in 2005 and 1103P in 2006) were treated at different stages of the propagation process. In 2007, artificially infected 1103P cuttings were treated with HWT and cyproconazole after being inoculated with P. chlamydospora, and the fungus was detected by isolation on agar medium. The effect of HWT on the growth of 1103P, 779P, Sangiovese and Cabernet franc cuttings was also assessed. Despite extended wood discoloration, P. chlamydospora was scarce in nursery vines during the three-year period. The contamination of planting material may have resulted from already infected mother plants (0.0 to 6.7\% of infected cuttings) or may have started during the propagation, particularly after grafting (0.0 to 23.3\% of infected grafts). Canes from esca-diseased mother plants were always infected, but the incidence of infection of the cuttings varied widely (about 30\% in 2005, from 1.9 to 4.1\% in the other years). However, no final conclusions could be drawn about the stage or stages at which the nursery vines mainly became infected, because the infection frequencies detected in the propagation process were too low and irregular. As regards control of P. chlamydospora, HWT of cuttings performed before or after cold storage influenced plant growth, depending on both the cultivar and the growing conditions, but HWT was harmful to callused graftlings. Natural contamination of nursery material in 2005 and 2006 was insufficient to allow the effectiveness of treatments to be assessed. In 2007, HWT and cyproconzole alone did not reduce the percentage of infection in artificially inoculated cuttings. Only cyproconazole immediately followed by HWT significantly reduced the number of infected cuttings, but this procedure did not eradicate the pathogen.},

Resistance to dagger nematode vectors has been identified and successfully transferred to rootstock genotypes that are commercially available, but these resistant materials do not prevent virus translocation into the scion, although a significant delay in infection can allow for suitable production. In this review, we critically evaluate the literature regarding resistance against viruses and vectors in Vitis and Muscadinia species. We examine the challenges of breeding grapevines for virus resistance and the methodologies used to test for resistance.

	doi = {10.1560/IJPS.59.2-4.177},
	abstract = {During the last 50 years world irrigation has doubled while water withdrawal has tripled, leading to a global water crisis. As a result, growers around the world are forced to utilize effluent water for irrigation. In Israel the main source for such water is “SHAFDAN”, i.e., tertiary-treated waste water, which is characterized by high chloride content that might increase in the future. These days about 33\% of Israeli citrus orchards are irrigated with this water, yet its potential effect on citrus orchards is not clear. Citrus is one of the major fruit crops of the world and is relatively salt-sensitive. Recently it was reported that continuous application of KNO3 might reduce chloride (Cl) uptake, and thus overcome the toxic effects of salinity. We examined the effect of KNO3 fertilization and rootstock on grapefruit's response to salinized SHAFDAN reclaimed water over four years. Trees were grafted on five different rootstocks and fertigated with two KNO3 regimes (118 vs. 148 mg l(-1) NO3), and exposed to five levels of salinized reclaimed water (from 221 to 765 mg l(-1) Cl). During the experiment, soil electrical conductivity (EC) ranged from 2 dS m(-1) (above the threshold for yield reduction) to 5 dS m(-1). Leaf Cl (with the exception of trees grafted on Troyer) usually kept below toxicity level, i.e., {\textgreater}0.4\%. Cumulative yield reduction due to salinity was 37.6, 21.3, 18.2, 17.2, and 12.6 kg per tree per dS m(-1) of soil paste extract, for trees grafted on 812, SO, Volk, Gau, and Troy rootstocks, respectively, reflecting their sensitivity to the osmotic component of salt stress. Enhanced application of KNO3 did not overcome the osmotic effect of salinity. These results indicate that while using reclaimed water, the osmotic component of salinity can be of higher significance than its toxic component, and more attention should be given in the future to the rootstock/scion combination's sensitivity to the osmotic component of salinity.},

The disease was characterized by a sudden wilting and dieback of plants any time during the growing season. In the spring, entire plants or parts of plants failed to break bud.

Orchards planted following long-term maize, wheat, or grass culture were almost disease free. A fungus was consistently isolated from symptomatic vascular tissue.

Ferguson `Hayward', A. chinensis `Hort16A' and A. chinensis `Hort 16A'/A. deliciosa `Bruno' seedling rootstocks, were inoculated. Eight weeks after inoculation, typical wilting and dieback symptoms developed on 90\% of the plants. Control plants dipped in sterile distilled water remained healthy. Verticillium wilt has never been reported on kiwifruit (A. deliciosa) in Chile. V. albo-atrum has a rather narrow host range and is mainly reported as a pathogen on alfalfa, hop, soybean, tomato, and potato. This is the first report of V. albo-atrum causing wilt and dieback on Gold kiwifruit (A. chinensis) `Hort16A'.},

	abstract = {Since Japanese beetles ((Popillia japonica Newman, Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) were first reported in Northwest Arkansas in 1997, population and geographic distribution have increased significantly accompanied by damage to horticultural crops and other plants. The adult beetle trapping period in Northwest Arkansas counties begins in June and continues until mid-August with the greatest capture from 7 to 30 July. This paper reports observations of adult Japanese beetle (JB) damage during the period of 2003 through 2005 in fruit crops grown in Fayetteville, AR. Adult beetle trap catches increased annually from 1997 until 2004, decreased in 2005 and 2007 but rebounded in 2006 and 2008. The foliage of 262 apple, 27 apple rootstock, 17 crabapple, 21 blueberry, 20 blackberry and 17 grape genotypes was evaluated for adult JB feeding damage by multiple evaluators during two growing seasons (2003 and 2004). The majority of apple, crabapple, blackberry, blueberry, and grape genotypes had moderate to severe foliar feeding damage, but, several apple, blackberry, blueberry, and grape genotypes had minimal damage. When apples of the same cultivar ('Gala') on different rootstocks were evaluated, scion foliage damage varied significantly with rootstock. The findings and observations of this study may be useful in future research on the molecular or biochemical basis for variation in feeding preference, for breeding new genotypes with low adult foliar feeding susceptibility, and as a basis for developing recommendations and management strategies for Japanese beetle in fruit plantings in the upper mid-south region.},

Phylogenetic analyses suggested two to three evolutionarily divergent lineages that did not reflect the vineyard origin of the isolates or an association with rootstock genotype or scion cultivar. Examination of the genetic variability of the California isolates alongside isolates worldwide, for which three RNA1 and 44 RNA2 coding sequences are available, revealed similar patterns of molecular evolution for the different regions within the GFLV genome but distinct selection constraints with the strongest pressure exerted on genes 2C(CP) and 28(MP), an intermediate level of pressure exerted on gene 1E(Pol), and the weakest pressure exerted on gene 2A(HP). Some of the California isolates resulted from interspecies recombination events between GFLV and Arabis mosaic virus with crossover sites suspected in gene 1E(Pol) and identified in genes 2A(HP) and 2B(MP); and intraspecies recombination events inferred in the four target genes but most frequently observed within gene 2C(CP).

	abstract = {`Hamlin' is a principal sweet orange grown in Florida for processing. It is productive but produces juice with low soluble solids content and poor color. A long-term trial was conducted in central Florida to determine rootstock effects on yield and juice quality and the effect of economic analysis on the interpretation of the horticultural results. The trees were a commonly used commercial selection of `Hamlin' sweet orange [Citrus sinensis (L.) Osb.] propagated on 19 rootstocks planted in a randomized complete block design of three-tree plots with six replicates in a Spodosol soil at a density of 350 trees/ha. Routine horticultural data were collected from the original trial (H1) for 10 years. Trees on some rootstocks that grew and yielded poorly were removed within a few years and replaced with a second trial (H2) with 13 rootstocks from which data were collected for 5 years. The H1 data were financially analyzed to compare the relative usefulness of horticultural and economic data in interpreting results and making rootstock decisions. In H1 after 10 years, tree height ranged from greater than 5 m [Volkamer lemon (C. volkameriana Ten. \& Pasq.)] and Cleopatra mandarin (C. reshni Hort. ex Tan.) to 2.4 m \{Flying Dragon trifoliate orange [Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf.]\}. In H2, the trees on somatic hybrid rootstocks were approximate to 2 m tall after 8 years and 4.4 m among those on mandarins and C-32 citrange (C. sinensis x P. trifoliata). Tree losses from citrus blight were generally low except for the trees on Carrizo and Troyer citranges (greater than 50\%). Horticulturally, the highest performing trees in H1, measured by cumulative yield and soluble solids production over 10 years, were those on Carrizo, Troyer, and Benton citranges; poor performers were those on Smooth Flat Seville and Kinkoji (putative sour orange hybrids). Fruit yield and soluble solids production were directly related to tree height regardless of the difference among rootstocks in juice quality. The same relationship existed among the trees in H2 in which the best rootstocks were C-32 and Morton citranges. Trees on Swingle citrumelo (C. paradisi Macf. x P. trifoliata) ranked no. 12 of 19 rootstocks and 9 of 13 rootstocks in H1 and H2, respectively. Financial interpretation of the outcomes to include tree replacement resulting from blight losses did not substantially change the horticultural interpretations. Additional financial analyses demonstrated that the performance of trees on rootstocks with relatively low productivity/tree, like those on C-35 citrange and Kinkoji, would equal those on more vigorous rootstocks when tree vigor was properly matched with spacing. Yield determined the economic outcomes and financial analysis aided the interpretation of rootstock horticultural effects but did not greatly alter the relationship among rootstock results. Highly significant correlations between annual and cumulative data indicated that relative rootstock performance among `Hamlin' orange trees in Florida could be reliably determined based on the first 4 cropping years.},

The objectives were to compare rootstock horticultural performance between two locations with soils representative of the Central Florida Ridge (AP) and coastal Hatwoods (I), the major citrus-growing regions in Florida, and to see if financial analysis would provide an improved basis for interpreting rootstock performance. The randomized complete-block trials involved six-tree plots replicated eight or 10 times at planting densities of 358 trees (AP) or 252 trees (I)/ha, respectively. Tree growth and survival, yield, and juice quality were measured for 15 years. When losses occurred, trees were replaced annually with another one on the same rootstock. The data of seven rootstocks were subjected to a financial interpretation of three scenarios: tree loss and tree loss with or without tree replacement using the discounted cash flow and internal rate of return methods at a 15\% rate. At the flatwoods location, when differences among replications became apparent on several rootstocks, soil data were collected to study its possible association to tree performance; also in this trial, 400-kg fruit samples were differentially harvested in 2 successive years from mature trees on each of five commercial rootstocks when the juice soluble solids/acid ratio was near 15. The juice was extracted, pasteurized, and evaluated for flavor by an experienced taste panel. The horticultural data obtained for trees on specific well-studied rootstocks [Volkamer (C. volkameriana Ten. \& Pasq.)] and rough (C. jambhiri Lush.) lemons, Carrizo citrange [C. sinensis x Poncirus tripliata (L.)], sour orange [C. aurantium (L.)], Cleopatra mandarin (C. reshni Hort. ex Tan.), trifoliate orange (P. trifoliata), a selection of sweet orange (C. silicosis), and Swingle citrumelo (C. paradisi Macf. x P. trifoliata) at both locations were typical of their well-documented performance in Florida and elsewhere. Tree losses were virtually only from citrus blight and ranged from none (sour orange) to greater than 50\% (Volkamer and rough lemons) at both locations, although tree loss began later at the Central Florida location. `Valencia' cuttings (only at the flatwoods site) were long-lived and cropped well for their smaller size compared with the budded trees. Taste panelists were not able to distinguish differences over two seasons among pasteurized `Valencia' juices produced from trees on different rootstocks and normalized by soluble solids/acid ratio. Yield and planting density were the main factors affecting financial outcome; also, in the highly variable soils of the coastal Hatwoods, trees growing in sites with greater depth to an argillic layer had 30\% to 200\% higher yields. Trees on Volkamer lemon had only approximate to 50\% survival at both locations but had the highest ({\textbackslash}7,338/ha I) or one of the highest cash flows ({\textbackslash}13,464/ha AP) as compared with one of the commercial standards, Carrizo citrange ({\textbackslash}6,928 I; {\textbackslash}16,826 AP), which had only approximate to 25\% tree loss. Inclusion of financial analysis, with certain limitations, was concluded to considerably improve rootstock selection decisions compared with selection based only on horticultural data.},

Wine quality was significantly better from L0 than L2. Petiole N concentrations were above normal in all treatments.

A total of 84 full-length coat protein (CP) sequences and 57 sequences representing the helicase-encoding region (HR) of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase were obtained from wine grape cultivars grown in the Pacific North-West (PNW) of the United States and their molecular diversity was compared with corresponding sequences previously reported from other grape-growing regions. In pairwise comparisons, the CP sequences from PNW isolates showed identities between 80 and 100\% at the nucleotide level and the HR sequences showed identities between 79 and 100\%. A global phylogenetic analysis of the CP and HR sequences revealed segregation of GRSPaV isolates into four major lineages with isolates from PNW distributed in all four lineages, indicating a lack of clustering by geographical origin. Scion cultivars grafted onto rootstock were found to contain mixtures of more genetic variants belonging to different lineages than own-rooted cultivars. Assessment of population genetic parameters found that the CP was more variable than the HR region. The discordant gene phylogenies obtained for some CP and HR sequences and the identification of potential recombination events involving parents from different lineages provided strong evolutionary evidence for genetic diversity among GRSPaV isolates. These results underscore the highly variable nature of the virus with implications for grapevine health status and distribution of virus-tested planting materials. This study also contributes to an increased understanding of molecular population genetics of viruses infecting deciduous woody perennials.},

This work examines scion/rootstock interactions in young grafted grapevines. Its aim was to determine the effects of scion and rootstock genotypes on biomass allocation within the plant. Methods and Results: Five months after grafting, biomass allocation between the root and the shoot was measured for all the scion/rootstock combinations made between three Vitis genotypes. The scion genotype explained the highest percentage of the non-random variance for biomass allocation within the plant, including biomass allocation to the roots, i.e. it conferred differences in root vigour. In addition, we developed a double-grafted system, in which a single scion was grafted onto two rootstocks, to analyse further scion (or carbon source) effects on root development. Conclusions: This work provides evidence of conferred root vigour by the scion which does not appear to be related to carbon supply from the shoot. The genotypes studied display varying levels of plasticity in their response to different grafting partners. Significance of the Study: This work presents detailed analysis of biomass allocation within young grafted vines. In young grafted grapevines, the scion genotype has a major effect on most parameters of development, especially in the root. This aspect of rootstock/scion interactions should be taken into account when selecting rootstocks. A double-grafting system was developed for future research on signalling pathways and exchange mechanisms between scion and rootstock in grafted grapevine.},

It also compared consistency of yield performance of the various rootstocks with both scions over 8 years at one site with an ECiw of 2.1 dS/m. Methods and Results: Chardonnay and Shiraz on own roots and on Ramsey, 1103 Paulsen, 140 Ruggeri, K51-40, Schwarzmann, 101-14, Rupestris St. George and 1202 Couderc were compared. Ramsey resulted in better yields relative to most of the other rootstocks at three of the four sites for each scion. Exceptions were the low salinity site where Schwarzmann was best with Chardonnay, and Padthaway where 140 Ruggeri was best with Shiraz. Chardonnay wine chloride concentrations were similar to grape juice chloride concentrations, but Shiraz wine chloride concentrations were on average 1.7-fold higher than grape juice chloride. Conclusions: Shiraz on own roots, K51-40 and 1202C rootstocks carry some risk of accumulating unacceptable levels of chloride in grape juice and wine when the salinity of the irrigation water is at moderate to high levels. Rootstocks K51-40 (with Chardonnay and Shiraz) and potentially 101-14 (with Shiraz) should be avoided in situations of long term irrigation with moderate to high salinity water.

	abstract = {The use of rootstocks is gaining importance in Indian viticulture due to problems associated with abiotic stresses, such as drought and salinity, and also to improve scion characteristics. Thompson Seedless is the only commercial cultivar grown for both fresh consumption and raisin making. Dog Ridge was the only popular rootstock used by grape growers prior to late 1990s. But this rootstock was known to induce more vigour in scions, resulting in reduced bud fruitfulness and thereby fruit yield. To identify alternate rootstocks suitable for Thompson Seedless, a study was initiated in the National Research Centre for Grapes, Pune, India during the year 2001. Five rootstocks with own rooted vines were evaluated in this study. During the initial years, Thompson Seedless grafted on Dog Ridge produced the highest yield, with good quality fruit. Over the years we could observe uneven bud sprouting, gaps on the cordon due to dead wood formation, and reduced yield in vines grafted on Dog Ridge rootstocks. In contrast, Thompson Seedless grafted on 110R performed well in terms of moderate vigour, increased fruitfulness and consistently higher yield. Dog Ridge and St. George produced a lower yield, owing to increased vigour measured in terms of pruning weight, total shoot length and cane diameter. Rootstocks 110R, 1103P and 99R are also known to increase water-use efficiency during critical growth stages of fruit bud differentiation and full bloom. No significant influence of rootstocks was observed for most of the fruit composition parameters. Larger and bolder berries were produced on Dog ridge and 110R rootstock, while they were the smallest on own rooted vines.},

	abstract = {The production and quality of grapes are determined by the hydric and nutritional status of the vine. In modern viticulture, the interface between grapevine and soil is represented by the rootstock, which modulates the uptake of water and nutrients. Thus, selection of new rootstocks for abiotic stress tolerance represents an adaptation strategy for viticulture to the new environmental conditions imposed by climate change. The aim of this work is to evaluate the water-use efficiency (WUE) and the nutritional status of a selection of 30 new rootstock genotypes, originating from several breeding programs. WUE and gas exchange were measured for each genotype in two environments characterized by different water availability, and the levels of N, P, K, Mg, Ca, Na, Fe, Mn, and Zn in the leaf blades were determined during the phenological stages of flowering and ripening. Water availability was different in the two environments, affecting gas exchange, with mean values of carbon assimilation of 10.43 +/- 0.32 and 3.84 +/- 0.34 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1), respectively. Genotypes were classified according to their water stress tolerance, vigor, and affinity for macronutrients and micronutrients. A total of 14 genotypes showed tolerance to water stress, and 10 of them reported high vigor and carbon assimilation. Furthermore, the majority of water-stress-tolerant genotypes had greater affinity for Mg than for K. In further studies, the most promising rootstocks will be evaluated in grafting combination with Vitis vinifera.},

To better understand how rootstock influences citrus fruit quality, the literature that focuses on physico-chemical parameters, nutritional compounds and physiological disorders has been revised.

As a result, it is vital to pay close attention to the quality of clusters during handling. The current study aimed to determine whether Superior Seedless vines can be grown on specific rootstocks, resulting in higher quality during shelf life. Vines of the Superior Seedless vine cultivar that were used were 13 years old and had been grown on sandy soil. These vines were grafted onto four different rootstocks (genotypes), namely Freedom, 1103 Paulsen, SO4, and Own Root. The soluble solids content (SSC\%) was selected as 16\%. Bunches were subsequently stored in the lab at 27 +/- 1 degrees C with 57 +/- 3\% air relative humidity for three days. Rootstock 1103 Paulsen's quality was found to be superior to that of the other rootstocks, according to the results of the study. Rootstock 1103 Paulsen maintained its ascorbic acid (AA) content, which is reflected in its antioxidant capacity, according to the results. In addition, lipid peroxidation accumulation and ion leakage percentages indicated that oxidative reactions were at their lowest levels. The results show that 1103 Paulsen decreases cellular metabolism enzyme activities at the shelf life level and improves the bunch quality of Superior Seedless (scion) grapes within 4 days of application. As a whole, the results show that the 1103 Paulsen rootstock produces Superior Seedless bunches of a high quality that is preserved throughout the shelf life period.},

	abstract = {Simple Summary In most wine regions around the world, commercial vineyards are planted with Vitis vinifera scions grafted on grape phylloxera-tolerating rootstocks. Root-feeding phylloxera populations still thrive on such rootstocks and occasionally leaf-feeding phylloxera populations are observed. The cause for these foliar infestations is thought to reside at the thickets of abandoned rootstock vines that grow on the risers of vineyard terraces and constitute a different habitat with large leaf-feeding populations. Besides, it is unclear if root and leaf populations within commercial vineyards are genetically connected, which may indicate a process of adaption that could lead to large foliar phylloxera populations and better-adapted phylloxera biotypes. To shed light on these issues, phylloxera root- and leaf-feeding larvae from commercial vineyards and larvae from nearby thickets were genetically compared, focusing on population structure and genetic association. Our study showed that foliar populations in commercial vineyards not only originate from leaf-feeding populations on nearby abandoned rootstock vines, but also from root populations within the vineyard. The results suggest that sexual recombination is rare in the study area and that direct root-leaf migration creates population bottlenecks based on founder effects or host plant adaption. Depending on their life cycle, grape phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae Fitch) leaf-feeding populations are initiated through asexually produced offspring or sexual recombination. The vine's initial foliar larvae may originate from root-feeding phylloxera or wind-drifted foliar larvae from other habitats. Though some studies have reported phylloxera leaf-feeding in commercial vineyards, it is still unclear if they are genetically distinct from the population structure of these two sources. Using seven SSR-markers, this study analyzed the genetic structure of phylloxera populations in commercial vineyards with different natural infestation scenarios and that of single-plant insect systems that exclude infestation by wind-drifted larvae. We saw that during the vegetation period, phylloxera populations predominately go through their asexual life cycle to migrate from roots to leaves. We provided evidence that such migrations do not exclusively occur through wind-drifted foliar populations from rootstock vines in abandoned thickets, but that root populations within commercial vineyards also migrate to establish V. vinifera leaf populations. Whereas the former scenario generates foliar populations with high genotypic diversity, the latter produces population bottlenecks through founder effects or phylloxera biotype selection pressure. We finally compared these population structures with those of populations in their native habitat in North America, using four microsatellite markers.},

RNA sequencing data were mapped to a high-quality Cabernet Franc genome reference assembled to carry out this study and integrated with hormone and metabolite abundance data. This study characterized conserved and condition-dependent responses to GLRaV infection(s). Common responses to GLRaVs were reproduced in two consecutive years and occurred in plants grafted to different rootstocks in more than one infection condition. Though different infections were inconsistently distinguishable from one another, the effects of infections in plants grafted to different rootstocks were distinct at each developmental stage. Conserved responses included the modulation of genes related to pathogen detection, abscisic acid (ABA) signalling, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and cytoskeleton remodelling. ABA, ABA glucose ester, ABA and hormone signalling-related gene expression, and the expression of genes in several transcription factor families differentiated the effects of GLRaVs in berries from Cabernet Franc grapevines grafted to different rootstocks. These results support that ABA participates in the shared responses to GLRaV infection and differentiates the responses observed in grapevines grafted to different rootstocks.},

	abstract = {Salinity, which is predominantly an issue for agricultural systems in arid and semi-arid regions, has the potential to impair grape production and wine quality, and its impact on the grape and wine industries is predicted to increase with climate change. Research on the physiological and molecular changes that occur in salt-affected vines has unveiled complex osmotic and ionic responses that include oxidative stress, water loss, photoinhibition, growth inhibition and necrosis. Proposed salt tolerance mechanisms include elevated antioxidant production, hydric regulation and salt exclusion from shoots and berries. These later of these mechanisms is found in certain Vitis genotypes that, when grafted as rootstocks, can protect fruit-bearing scions from accumulating significant amounts of saline ions from soils, most notably through the presence of specific transport proteins that are involved in regulating the transfer of ions from root to shoot via the xylem. Significant gaps in knowledge remain, however, regarding salt tolerance mechanisms for Vitis species, with many mechanisms inferred from other species or documented only at the level of gene expression. A better understanding of the mechanisms that confer salt tolerance in Vitis species is needed to improve the production of new germplasm that is locally adapted and better suited to the challenges of a changing climate. Hence, this review covers the current knowledge on the characteristics that are associated with salt damage and tolerance in grapevine cultivars and rootstocks and highlights possible future avenues that will enable development of new options for the industry to combat salinity.},

The aim of this study was to establish in vitro biological methods for indexing grapevine leafroll-associated virus-3 (GLRaV-3) in red- and white-berried grapevines. Methods and Results Healthy, red-berried grapevine Cabernet Sauvignon [CaSa (H)] was used as a rootstock in micrografting experiments with virus-infected Cabernet Sauvignon [CaSa (VI)] and Chardonnay [Ch (VI)] scions. Vascular bundles connecting the rootstock and scions developed, and 100\% of the micrografts survived 3 and 4 weeks after micrografting, respectively. Symptoms of GLRaV-3 were expressed in 80 and 20\% of CaSa (H) rootstocks micrografted with CaSa (VI) and with Ch (VI) scions, respectively, 12 weeks after micrografting. The rootstock CaSa (H) that had been micrografted with CaSa (VI) and Ch (VI) scions for 5 weeks was subsequently cultured on half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 75 mmol/L NaCl to induce salt stress. The GLRaV-3 symptoms were expressed in 88\% of micrografts CaSa (VI)/CaSa (H) and 85\% of micrografts Ch (VI)/CaSa (H) after 5 weeks of salt stress. Reddish-purple leaf coloration and downward rolling were observed in CaSa (H) rootstocks that were micrografted with CaSa (VI) scions, while leaf downward rolling and yellowing were seen in CaSa (H) rootstocks that were micrografted with Ch (VI) scions. Conclusions Salt stress improved in vitro biological indexing of GLRaV-3 in grapevines. Significance of the Study Establishment of in vitro micrografting and salt stress provided alternative methods for indexing of GLRaV-3 in red- and white-berried grapevines.},

In order to elucidate the scale and the content of scion-rootstock metabolic interactions, we profiled the metabolome of eleven graft combination in leaves, stems, and phloem exudate from both above and below the graft union 5-6 months after grafting. We compared the metabolome of scions vs. rootstocks of homografts vs. heterografts and investigated the reciprocal effect of the rootstock on the scion metabolome. This approach revealed that (1) grafting has a minor impact on the metabolome of grafted grapevines when tissues and genotypes were compared, (2) heterografting affects rootstocks more than scions, (3) the presence of a heterologous grafting partner increases defense-related compounds in both scion and rootstocks in shorter and longer distances from the graft, and (4) leaves were revealed as the best tissue to search for grafting-related metabolic markers. These results will provide a valuable metabolomics resource for scion-rootstock interaction studies and will facilitate future efforts on the identification of metabolic markers for important agronomic traits in grafted grapevines.},

Nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC) in infested and noninfested tissue of different organs and plant biomass were measured at the end of the experiment. At the peak of the biotic stress treatment, the plants reduced transpiration by about 30\% compared to control, while photosynthesis remained unaffected. Lower soluble NSC were measured in infested than in the nearby noninfested tissue of both L and R+L groups, suggesting sugar consumption by the insect, while infested roots increased starch content by fivefold. NSC were depleted in noninfested roots of R+L plants as well, giving strength to the hypothesis of intense metabolites translocation in favor of the insect. A more distinct physiological depression in R+L vines compared to L was highlighted, even if the total biomass reduction was more marked in L plants. Our preliminary results suggest that the insect reprograms plant metabolism stimulating a more conservative water use, while competing with the host plant for carbon resources. Further studies should validate current results and quantify the NSC invested in the plant's defense against the pest.},

The effect of rootstock was relatively consistent across years and varieties, explaining between 8.99\% and 9.78\% of the variation in growth-related traits including yield, pruning weight, berry weight and Ravaz index (yield to pruning weight ratio). Increases in yield due to rootstock were generally the result of increases in berry weight, likely due to increased water uptake by vines grafted to a particular rootstock.

To this aim, trials were carried out to evaluate the efficacy of copper-based treatments, formulated with hydroxyapatite (HA) as co-adjuvant with innovative delivery properties, loaded with two different copper(II) compounds (tribasic sulfate and sulfate pentahydrate), and applied to grapevine propagation material to inhibit fungal wood colonization.

Experimental treatments were applied during the water-soaking process, comparing the copper(II) compounds pure or formulated with HA, to hydrate the cuttings. After callusing, grafted vines were grown under greenhouse conditions in a nursery and inoculated with Pmi::gfp7 or with Pmi wild-type. Fifteen weeks post-inoculation, woody tissues close to the inoculation site were sampled to evaluate the efficiency of the treatments by studying the plant-microbe interaction by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Copper and further elements were also quantified in the same tissues immediately after the treatments and on the CLSM samples. Finally, the grapevine defense responses were studied in the leaves of cuttings treated with the same formulations. The present investigation confirmed the relevant interaction of Pmi and the related transformed strain on the vascular tissues of grafted vines. Furthermore, in vitro assay revealed (i) the fungistatic effect of HA and the reduced effect of Cu fungicide when combined with HA. In planta assays showed (ii) the reduction of Pmi infection in propagation material treated with HA-Cu formulations, (iii) the movement of HA-Cu formulations inside the plant tissues and their persistence over time, and (iv) the plant defense reaction following the treatment with pure HA or Cu, or combined.},

A completely randomized 3 x 2 x 2 factorial experiment was designed with two vine rootstocks or own-rooted vines, two scion cultivars, and 100 mM NaCl salinity or control treatments, with six replications. A significant effect of scion cultivar, rootstock, and salinity was observed for most of the measured parameters.

Salinity stress increased Chloride (Cl) and Sodium (Na) concentrations in all parts of the vines and decreased leaf concentrations of Potassium (K), Calcium (Ca), Magnesium (Mg), Nitrogen (N), and Iron (Fe). In contrast, salinity stress increased leaf Boron (B) concentrations, whereas that of Manganese (Mn) remained unaffected. Leaf chlorophyll concentration decreased from 42\% to 40\% after thirty and sixty days of salt treatment, respectively. A similar trend was observed for the CCM-200 relative chlorophyll content. Salinity significantly decreased steam water potential (Ws), net CO2 assimilation rate (A), and stomatal conductance (g(s)) in all cases of grafted or own-rooted vines. Sixty days after the beginning of salt treatment, total Phenolics and PSII maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm) decreased significantly.

(ii) Genetics and genomics of grapevine stress tolerance. The description of the grapevine genome is more and more precise. The genetic variations among genotypes are now revealed with new technologies with the sequencing of very long DNA molecules. High throughput technologies for DNA sequencing also allow now the genetic characterization at the same time of hundreds of genotypes for thousands of points in the genome, which provides unprecedented datasets for genotype-phenotype associations studies. We review the current knowledge on the genetic determinism of traits for the adaptation to climate change. We focus on quantitative trait loci and molecular markers available for developmental stages, tolerance to water stress/water use efficiency, sugar content, acidity, and secondary metabolism of the berries. (iii) Controlling the genome and its expression to allow breeding of better-adapted genotypes. High-density DNA genotyping can be used to select genotypes with specific interesting alleles but genomic selection is also a powerful method able to take into account the genetic information along the whole genome to predict a phenotype. Modern technologies are also able to generate mutations that are possibly interesting for generating new phenotypes but the most promising one is the direct editing of the genome at a precise location.},

In viticulture, grapevine scion cultivars are grafted onto rootstocks to reduce the incidence of the grapevine pest phylloxera. However, it is unknown to what extent this practice influences root-associated microbial communities. A field survey of bacteria in soil surrounding the roots (rhizosphere) of 4 cultivars x 4 rootstock combinations was conducted to determine whether rootstock and cultivar genotypes are important drivers of rhizosphere community diversity and composition. Differences in alpha-diversity was highly dependent on rootstock-cultivar combinations, while bacterial community structure primarily clustered according to cultivar differences, followed by differences in rootstocks. Twenty-four bacterial indicator genera were significantly more abundant in one or more cultivars, while only thirteen were found to be specifically associated with one or more rootstock genotypes, but there was little overlap between cultivar and rootstock indicator genera. Bacterial diversity in grafted grapevines was affected by both cultivar and rootstock identity, but this effect was dependent on which diversity measure was being examined (i.e., alpha- or beta-diversity) and specific rootstock-cultivar combinations. These findings could have functional implications, for instance, if specific combinations varied in their ability to attract beneficial microbial taxa which can control pathogens and/or assist plant performance.},

	abstract = {Plant grafting is an ancient agricultural practice widely employed in crops such as woody fruit trees, grapes, and vegetables, in order to improve plant performance. Successful grafting requires the interaction of compatible scion and rootstock genotypes. This involves an intricate network of molecular mechanisms operating at the graft junction and associated with the development and the physiology of the scion, ultimately leading to improved agricultural characteristics such as fruit quality and increased tolerance/resistance to abiotic and biotic factors. Bidirectional transfer of molecular signals such as hormones, nutrients, proteins, and nucleic acids from the rootstock to the scion and vice versa have been well documented. In recent years, studies on rootstock-scion interactions have proposed the existence of an epigenetic component in grafting reactions. Epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and the action of small RNA molecules are known to modulate chromatin architecture, leading to gene expression changes and impacting cellular function. Mobile small RNAs (siRNAs) migrating across the graft union from the rootstock to the scion and vice versa mediate modifications in the DNA methylation pattern of the recipient partner, leading to altered chromatin structure and transcriptional reprogramming. Moreover, graft-induced DNA methylation changes and gene expression shifts in the scion have been associated with variations in graft performance. If these changes are heritable they can lead to stably altered phenotypes and affect important agricultural traits, making grafting an alternative to breeding for the production of superior plants with improved traits. However, most reviews on the molecular mechanisms underlying this process comprise studies related to vegetable grafting. In this review we will provide a comprehensive presentation of the current knowledge on the epigenetic changes and transcriptional reprogramming associated with the rootstock-scion interaction focusing on woody plant species, including the recent findings arising from the employment of advanced-omics technologies as well as transgrafting methodologies and their potential exploitation for generating superior quality grafts in woody species. Furthermore, will discuss graft-induced heritable epigenetic changes leading to novel plant phenotypes and their implication to woody crop improvement for yield, quality, and stress resilience, within the context of climate change.},

	abstract = {Societal Impact Statement Leaf shapes are critical to the identification of grapevine varieties. Historically, measures of grapevine leaves were used to enforce appellation law and leaf shape is used to this day to distinguish economically important clones that genetic analyses fail to discriminate. The ampelometry (”vine” + “process of measuring”) of Pierre Galet (1921-2019), through quantitative measurements and hand-drawings, illuminated the beauty of grapevine diversity for the world. Here, mathematical methods rigorously quantifying hand-drawings of grapevine leaves are presented, with implications for how we document and preserve the stunning diversity of plants we so readily see with our eyes. Summary People have an innate ability to recognize different patterns in among plants. Quantifying these differences, that we assimilate so effortlessly with our senses, is more challenging. Grapevines are a special case in which leaf shape has been critical to identify varieties correctly. The distinct morphology of grapevine leaves lends itself to the application of mathematical approaches that quantify shape. Here, corresponding points on every grapevine leaf (landmarks) and equidistant points between landmarks (pseudo-landmarks) were used to capture intricate, local features in grapevine leaves: the curvature of veins, lobes, and sinuses and the shapes of serrations. Using these points, averaged leaf shapes for 60 varieties of wine and table grapes were calculated that quantify shape to the same resolution as hand drawings. The overall morphological similarity of each variety to the other classified the leaves into two discrete groups: (i) deeply lobed and (ii) more entire-corresponding to the measurements of sinus depth put forward by the ampelographer Pierre Galet. Using the system of Galet, landmarks, and pseudo-landmarks were converted into relative distance and angle measurements. Using a high number of landmarks and pseudolandmarks increased the accuracy of predicting variety correctly, compared to using a finite number of landmarks alone. The ability to identify correctly a vine variety from leaf shape will have significant implications for the wine industry, from ensuring correct scion and rootstock plantings in vineyards, to enforcing appellation law to discerning clones that are genetically indistinguishable.},

In addition, we compared the growth, fruit quality, and yield efficiency of `Fuyu' scions grafted onto three candidate dwarfing rootstocks ('Hourakudai', No. 3, and 522 clones) with those of `Aogaki' seedlings grown under conventional cultivation (pruned and fruited). In unpruned and non-bearing trees, grafts on 522 and `Flourakudai' rootstocks reached about 75 \% of the height of trees on the standard rootstock. Tree canopy volumes on the 522 and `Flourakudai' rootstocks were about 67 \% and 42 \%, respectively, of those on the standard rootstock. The high positive correlation between TCSA and tree canopy volume was observed for not only between trees grown under unpruned and nonbearing but also trees grown under pruned and bearing. Tree canopy volume was a better indicator of dwarfing capacity of rootstocks than tree height or tree canopy area. In conventional cultivation, trees grafted on all three candidate dwarfing rootstocks had smaller canopy area and canopy volume than those grafted onto the standard rootstock, from 2 to 11 years after planting. Although differences in tree growth between the three dwarf rootstocks were observed, the differences tended to decrease as tree age advanced. The quality of fruit produced (fruit weight, soluble solids content, and skin color) by trees on dwarf rootstocks did not differ from that produced on standard rootstocks, although annual variations occurred. Trees on 522 rootstock had the lowest yield owing to decreased vigor. Trees on `Flourakudai' rootstock had the highest yield efficiency per trunk cross-sectional area of scions and per tree canopy volume. `Flourakudai' softwood cuttings showed the highest rooting rate (80 \%). These results identify `Flourakudai' as a promising new rootstock for growing dwarfed `Fuyu' trees, owing to the high yield efficiency without a decrease in fruit quality.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus is essential for plant life and plants have developed numerous strategies to maximise phosphate (Pi) acquisition and use under limited Pi supply. Here we have used reciprocal grafting to determine whether the shoot and root have different roles in regulating some of these strategies. Reciprocal grafts of two grapevine genotypes (Vitis vinifera cv. Pinot noir and V. berlandieri x V. rupestris cv. 1103 Paulsen) were produced as well as the corresponding homo-graft controls; the plants were grown in hydroponic culture and subjected to two levels of Pi supply (high (0.6 mM) or low (0.001 mM)). Biomass accumulation, root morphology, and root, stem and leaf organic acid, phosphate, nitrate and sulphate concentrations were measured. The transcript abundance of orthologues of known phosphate starvation induced (PSI) genes from Arabidopsis was also quantified. Under high Pi, the scion genotype had a large impact on plant growth, but the morphology of roots (such as root tip density) was not affected. Low Pi supply affected growth, tissue organic acid concentration, the activity of acid phosphatases released by the roots and the expression of PSI genes. Rootstock genotypes showed differences in root responses to low Pi supply, but the scion also exerted long-distance regulation of rootstock responses to low Pi, for example, modifying PSI gene expression, sulphate acquisition efficiency, the activity of acid phosphatases released by the roots and root organic acid concentrations. This work shows for the first time that the grapevine genotypes differ in their response to low Pi supply and that the scion can modify rootstock responses to the nutrient availability. This work highlights that genetic variation in shoot-borne signals can regulate root responses to Pi supply and that understanding rootstock responses to the environment must be done considering scion influence.},

	abstract = {Grapevine rootstocks play a pivotal role in plant responses to water deficiency (WD); therefore, the selection of new genotypes is a promising strategy for future agricultural managements aimed to cope with climate changes. Recent studies reinforced the central role of the root system in modulating WD responses, as it not only controls water uptake and transport to the leaves, but it also participates in stress perception and stress signalling to the shoot. The present work evaluated the performance of the 101.14 and M4 rootstocks in graft combination with the cultivar Cabernet Sauvignon (Cab) by assessing some of the canonical molecular, biochemical and physiological responses induced by WD. The autograft Cab/Cab was also included in the experimental design as a control. Under WD, Cab/M4 showed a greater capacity to sustain CO2 assimilation rate (A(n)) and stomatal conductance (g(s)), while limiting the decrease of leaf potential (Psi(leaf)) compared with the other graft combinations. The enhanced adaptability of Cab/M4 to WD was also supported by the higher uptake of water from the soil, estimated by measuring the daily water lost of plants, and by the reduced effect of the drought treatment on the total root biomass. Quantification of ABA in both root and leaf organs revealed a reduced accumulation in Cab/M4 plants, thus confirming the lower sensitivity of the Cab/M4 combination to water deficit. At the molecular level, the expression of selected stress-responsive ABA-related genes was investigated, including genes involved in ABA biosynthesis (VviNCED3), ABA signalling (VviPP2C9, VviPP2C4, VviSnRk2.6), regulation of gene expression (VviABF2) and stomatal opening (VviSIRK, VviMYB60). Results indicated a tight correlation between the level of gene expression and of ABA accumulation in roots and leaves, suggesting that ABA synthesis and signalling were attenuated in Cab/M4 as compared with Cab/101.14 and Cab/Cab. As a whole, our data demonstrated the capacity of M4 to satisfy the water demand of the scion under limited water availability, as revealed by delayed stomatal closure and higher photosynthetic activity. Importantly, these physiological adaptive traits related to attenuated ABA-mediated responses in roots and leaves.},

The rootstock contribution to scion growth is not fully understood. Since nitrogen (N) is a significant driver of grapevine growth, rootstock properties associated with N uptake and transport may play a key role in the growth potential of grafted grapevines. We evaluated N uptake and transport in a potted system using two grapevines rootstocks [Riparia Gloire (RG) and 1103 Paulsen (1103P)] grafted to Pinot noir (Pommard clone) scion. Combining results of nitrate induction and steady-state experiments at two N availability levels, we observed different responses in the uptake and utilization of N between the two rootstocks. The low vigor rootstock (RG) exhibited greater nitrate uptake capacity and nitrate assimilation in roots after nitrate resupply than the more vigorous 1103P rootstock. This behavior may be attributed to a greater root carbohydrate status observed in RG for both experiments. However, 1103P demonstrated a higher N translocation rate to shoots regardless of N availability. These distinct rootstock behaviors resulted in significant differences in biomass allocation between roots and shoots under N-limited conditions, although the overall vine biomass was not different. Under sufficient N supply, differences between rootstocks decreased but 1103P stored more N in roots, which may benefit growth in subsequent growing seasons. Overall, greater transpiration of vines grafted to 1103P rootstock causing higher N translocation to shoots could partially explain its known growth-promoting effect to scions under low and high N availability, whereas the low vigor typically conferred to scions by RG may result from the combination of lower N translocation to shoots and a greater allocation of biomass toward roots when N is low.},

	abstract = {Background: Understanding the complexity of the vine plant's response to water deficit represents a major challenge for sustainable winegrowing. Regulation of water use requires a coordinated action between scions and rootstocks on which cultivars are generally grafted to cope with phylloxera infestations. In this regard, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach was applied on an `ad hoc' association mapping panel including different Vitis species, in order to dissect the genetic basis of transpiration-related traits and to identify genomic regions of grape rootstocks associated with drought tolerance mechanisms. The panel was genotyped with the GrapeReSeq Illumina 20 K SNP array and SSR markers, and infrared thermography was applied to estimate stomatal conductance values during progressive water deficit. Results: In the association panel the level of genetic diversity was substantially lower for SNPs loci (0.32) than for SSR (0.87). GWAS detected 24 significant marker-trait associations along the various stages of drought-stress experiment and 13 candidate genes with a feasible role in drought response were identified. Gene expression analysis proved that three of these genes (VIT\_13s0019g03040, VIT\_17s0000g08960, VIT\_18s0001g15390) were actually induced by drought stress. Genetic variation of VIT\_17s0000g08960 coding for a raffinose synthase was further investigated by resequencing the gene of 85 individuals since a SNP located in the region (chr17\_10,497,222\_C\_T) was significantly associated with stomatal conductance. Conclusions: Our results represent a step forward towards the dissection of genetic basis that modulate the response to water deprivation in grape rootstocks. The knowledge derived from this study may be useful to exploit genotypic and phenotypic diversity in practical applications and to assist further investigations.},

Infection is latent in most scion and rootstock cultivars but can lead to several symptoms such as translucent spots and clearing of veins in leaves. Symptoms typically increase when infections with multiple virus species occur. Excluding infected grapevines from propagation is the only possibility to control the spread of this disease. Consequently, sensitive, inexpensive and fast methods for the detection of this virus are needed. In the present study, a detection method for GFkV was developed employing reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), a method to reverse transcribe viral RNA and amplify DNA in one step. Primers were designed to bind the coat protein gene. The RT-LAMP works without the need for time consuming RNA extraction. In contrast, a crude homogenate can be used directly to set up the RT-LAMP reaction. Sensitivity of RT-LAMP was compared to ELISA by diluting extracts from infected material in extracts prepared from healthy plants. While ELISA gave positive results for all undiluted samples and most samples diluted 1:10, RT-LAMP was positive for all samples diluted up to 1:100 and gave a positive signal even after diluting 1:1.000.000 in most cases. Thus, it is possible to identify also those plants with lower virus titers, which then can be excluded from further propagation.},

	abstract = {Lemon (Citrus limon), an interspecific hybrid between sour orange and citron, has been widely used as a rootstock along with trifoliate orange. Though lemons are superior to trifoliate orange in terms of their high seed germination rate throughout the year, one of the obstacles to using lemons as rootstocks is the lack of reliable, lemon-specific molecular markers to discriminate buds of the micro-grafted scion from those of the lemon rootstock. In order to obtain lemon-specific molecular markers, we compared the whole-plastid genomes available from four citrus species (lemon, pummelo, sweet orange, and mandarin) and developed seven plastid insertion/deletion (InDel) markers. The plastid InDel markers were applied to 46 citrus accessions that included lemons (17 accessions), grapefruit, mandarin, pummelo, sour orange, orange, papeda, tangor, and tangelo groups. The resulting dendrogram revealed that the citrus accessions used in this analysis could be distinctly classified into seven clusters. Lemons formed a separate cluster and had identical allele sizes for each InDel locus among all accessions investigated. This set of InDel markers could be a useful molecular tool for the rapid and clear discrimination of micro-grafted scions and lemon rootstocks during the production of virus-free citrus trees. The plastid InDel markers with maternal inheritance features can also be used to analyze the phylogenetic origin of various citrus cultivars including lemons.},

	abstract = {Recently, so-called `generative' rootstocks have been introduced by seed companies. This type of rootstock is supposed to limit excessive vegetative growth and promote steady fruit production throughout the season in grafted tomato production. In contrast, `vegetative' rootstocks have a tendency to cause excessive vegetative growth in grafted plants, leading to possible delay in onset of flowering and fruit set. Little research-based information is currently available to characterize such effects of generative and vegetative rootstocks on growth and development of grafted tomatoes. In this greenhouse study, eight tomato hybrid rootstocks with different descriptions of their attributes including generative, vegetative, vigorous, and mid vigor, were grafted with two grape tomato scions and two beefsteak tomato scions. Interactions significantly affected plant height, node number, stem diameter, and SPAD at early vegetative stage but did not affect stem diameter and SPAD at a late vegetative stage. Rootstocks had no effect on flowering date of the scion. The interactions of rootstock x scion type and rootstock x scion cultivar significantly affected leaf number, leaf area, and biomass accumulation in reproductive parts, leaf, stem and roots at the vegetative growth stage but not at the transition stage or at the beginning of harvest. For both tomato types, root dry weight and root surface area helped in discriminating different groups, but did not consistently drive the separation between different treatments. A consistent grouping pattern was not found among different scion types.},

This study describes the construction of a mechanistic, dynamic model for grapevine plant growth and canopy biomass (vigor). To parametrize and validate the model, the progeny from a cross of Ramsey (Vitis champinii) x Riparia Gloire (V. riparia) was evaluated. Plants with different vigor were grown in a greenhouse during the summer of 2014 and 2015. One set of plants was grafted with Cabernet Sauvignon. Shoot growth rate (b), leaf area (LA), dry biomass, whole plant and root specific hydraulic conductance (k(H) and L-pr), stomatal conductance (g(s)), and water potential (Psi) were measured. Partitioning indices and specific leaf area (SLA) were calculated. The model includes an empirical fit of a purported seasonal pattern of bioactive GAs based on published seasonal evolutionary levels and reference values. The model provided a good fit of the experimental data, with R 1/4 0.85. Simulation of single trait variations defined the individual effect of each variable on vigor determination. The model predicts, with acceptable accuracy, the vigor of a young plant through the measurement of L-pr and SLA. The model also permits further understanding of the functional traits that govern vigor, and, ultimately, could be considered useful for growers, breeders and those studying climate change.},

	abstract = {The aim of this work was to evaluate the susceptibility to flavescence doree (FD) of 12 Vitis vinifera cultivars grown in Piedmont, and representative of the wine-making tradition of this area. The experiments were conducted under controlled conditions to ensure constant infection pressure. Test plants were ex vitro potted vines, singly inoculated with four Scaphoideus titanus infected by FD-C phytoplasma (FDp), under greenhouse conditions. Vines were tested for FDp at 5 and 8 weeks postinoculation (wpi) and the phytoplasma load was measured in leaves and roots at 8 wpi. Within the 14 V. vinifera accessions (belonging to 12 cultivars), three susceptibility clusters were identified. Cultivars within the low susceptibility group showed low phytoplasma loads and low percentages of infected plants, suggesting a tolerant behaviour. To confirm these results, four Vitis cultivars, representing extremes of FD susceptibility from low to high, were grafted onto Kober 5BB rootstocks and inoculated with laboratory-infected S. titanus, under semi-field conditions. The transmission experiments onto grafted cuttings confirmed that susceptibility to the disease depends on the scion genotype. The data indicated that none of the tested V. vinifera genotypes are resistant to FD, although some cultivars with low susceptibility are available, and can be explored for identifying genetic traits involved in disease tolerance/resistance. Moreover, ranking Vitis genotypes for their susceptibility to FD is in itself a valuable tool to support vine growers in their decision management, by helping them to choose the most appropriate varieties according to their specific FD epidemiological contexts.},

In this study, the effects of five rootstocks (101-14, 1103P, Beta, 5BB and SO4) on the berry ripening and aromatic profiles of Chardonnay (CH) grape berries over two years (2016 and 2017) were evaluated and some differences were observed. Compared to the own-rooted vines, berry weight was increased by the rootstocks to varying extents and the berries from all the five grafted vines accumulated significantly lower total soluble solids (TSS). CH/101-14 increased the berries' titratable acid (TA) to varying degree, showing decreased TSS/TA ratio in CH/101-14 and suggesting tendency for retarding maturation. All the rootstocks except SO4 could enhance both the total amounts of free- and bound-form volatile compounds, especially CH/1103P. Five volatile compounds, free-benzeneacetaldehyde, bound-1-octen-3-ol, bound-(E)-2-nonenal, bound-1,2,4-trimethyl-benzene and bound-1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-benzene were identified to have significant contribution to distinguish the grafted rootstock cultivar of the Chardonnay grape berries. Furthermore, characteristic volatile compounds for each rootstock were also screened out. Combined with the characteristics and concentrations of volatile compounds, rootstock 1103P could significantly improve the free and bound volatile compounds in Chardonnay berries under our experimental conditions.},

With a randomized block experimental design and split-split plots over time, the overhead trellis, lyre, and vertical shoot positioning systems and two rootstocks ('IAC 572' and `IAC 766') in the harvest seasons of January-May, 2017 and January-May, 2018 were studied. Trellis systems, rootstocks, harvest seasons and their interactions affected the characteristics of the grapes. The treatments with equivalent responses in the seasons defined the specific characteristics of the grapes. The rootstock `IAC 766' provided greater bunch weight and lower acidity to the `Isabel Precoce' grapes, while `IAC 572' induced higher soluble solids contents. In both seasons, there was lower variation in berry resistance to compression and polyphenol and anthocyanin contents in grapes from grapevines grown on an overhead trellis. In turn, the use of lyre provided high antioxidant activity by the ABTS(center dot+) method in 2018. The highest antioxidant activity by the DPPH. method was due to the association of overhead trellis and `IAC 766'. With the use of the overhead trellis, equivalent phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity during the seasons resulted in a uniform quality.},

The complexity of soil-root interactions makes necessary a comprehensive approach taking into account physiology, pathology and genetics, in order to outline strategies to improve viticulture adaptation to current and future threats. Rootstocks are the link between soil and scion in grafted crops, and they have played an essential role in viticulture since the introduction of phylloxera into Europe at the end of the 19th century. This review outlines current and future challenges that are threatening the sustainability of the wine sector and the relevant role that rootstocks can play to face these threats. We describe how rootstocks along with soil management can be exploited as an essential tool to deal with the effects of climate change and of emerging soil-borne pests and pathogens.

	abstract = {Excess water in vineyard soils during grapevine growing season is expected to become a critical issue in Japan. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of constantly high soil water content which was controlled at constantly more than 20\% water content in soil on vegetative growth and berry quality of Cabernet Sauvignon over a 3-year growing season. A wireless sensor networking system for real-time monitoring of soil moisture was used to check that the experimental plot had constantly more than 20\% water content in soil. Veraison in the experimental plot controlled at constantly high soil water content started 10 days, 4 days and 1 day later than that in the non-irrigated experimental plot in the 2017, 2018 and 2019 growing seasons, respectively. The constantly high soil water content had no notable effects on berry quality, such as berry characteristics and berry composition, at harvest compared with the non-irrigated experimental plot, although there was a certain tendency that constantly high soil water content decreased anthocyanin contents in berry skins compared with those of non-irrigated grapevines during the three growing seasons. We postulated that waterlogging damage due to the increase in soil water content by frequent rainfall would be minimised by the selection of rootstock that confers tolerance to waterlogging stress for scion cultivars and/or viticultural practices to prevent decrease in soil temperature. Also, the introduction of Internet of Things technology for monitoring water status in vineyard soil is expected to contribute to improving practical approaches to vineyard soil water management.},

Therefore, a short-term study was performed on a batch of 12 potted cv. Sangiovese vines grafted either on M4 or on the drought susceptible SO4 rootstock. Ecophysiological assessments as whole canopy net CO2 exchange rate (NCER), transpiration (T-c), and pre-dawn leaf water potential (Psi(pd)) and UHPLC-ESI/QTOF-MS metabolomics were then used to investigate the different vine responses during water limiting conditions. Water stress was induced by applying 50 \% of estimated daily water use from days of year 184-208. M4 was able to deliver similar CO2, at a significantly reduced water use, compared to SO4 grafting. In turn, this resulted in enhanced canopy water use efficiency (NCER/T-c ratio) quantified as +15.1 \% during water stress and +21.7 \% at re-watering. Untargeted metabolomics showed a similar modulation of brassinosteroids and ABA between the two rootstocks, whereas the up accumulation of cytokinins and gibberellins under drought was peculiar of M4 grafted vines. The increase in gibberellins, together with a concurrent down accumulation of chlorophyll precursors and catabolites and an up accumulation of folates in M4 rootstock suggests that the capacity of limiting reactive-oxygen-species and redox imbalance under drought stress was improved. Finally, distinctive osmolyte accumulation patterns could be observed, with SO4 investing more on proline and glycinebetaine content and M4 primarily showing polyols accumulation.},

These plants were subjected to a low phosphate (LP) treatment and transcriptome profiling by RNA sequencing was done on root samples collected 27h after the onset of the LP treatment.ResultsA set of transcripts responsive to the LP treatment in all scion/rootstock combinations was identified. Gene expression patterns associated with genetic variation in response to LP were identified by comparing the response of the two homo-grafts. In addition, the scion was shown to modify root transcriptome responses to LP in a rootstock dependent manner. A weighted gene co-expression network analysis identified modules of correlated genes; the analysis of the association of these modules with the phosphate treatment, and the scion and rootstock genotype identified potential hub genes.ConclusionsThis study provides insights into the response of grafted grapevine to phosphate supply and identifies potential shoot-to-root signals that could vary between different grapevine genotypes.},

Grapevine rootstocks have been developed from wild Vitis species that provide resistance to nematode infections. However, the potential biochemical or mechanical mechanisms of resistance have not been thoroughly explored. Therefore, this study measured levels of stilbenoids in roots of non-infected and RKN-infected grapevines with Cabernet Sauvignon scion grafted to susceptible (O39-16) or resistant (Freedom) rootstocks. This was part of a larger effort to assess phenolic compound levels within grapevine rootstocks to determine roles of stilbenoid compounds in improving nematode resistance and overall plant health.ResultsNone of the assessed compounds were consistently greater in RKN infected plants versus healthy controls. Stilbenoids putatively identified as pallidol, ?-viniferin, miyabenol C, and hopeaphenol were overall much greater in Freedom than O39-16 rootstocks. By contrast, the stilbenoids ampelopsin A, omega -viniferin, and vitisin B were greater in O39-16 than Freedom. O39-16 and Freedom had similar levels of other stilbenoids especially monomers and dimers. Potentially the greater levels of specific stilbenoids present in Freedom than O39-16 provided RKN resistance. If validated, breeding programs could utilize the increased presence of these compounds as a marker for increased resistance to nematodes.},

	abstract = {Grafting is a well-established agricultural practice in cherry production for clonal propagation, altered plant vigor and architecture, increased tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses, precocity, and higher yield. Mobile molecules, such as water, hormones, nutrients, DNAs, RNAs, and proteins play essential roles in rootstock-scion interactions. Small RNAs (sRNAs) are 19 to 30-nucleotides (nt) RNA molecules that are a group of mobile signals in plants. Rootstock-to-scion transfer of transgene-derived small interfering RNAs enabled virus resistance in nontransgenic sweet cherry scion. To determine whether there was long-distance scion-to-rootstock transfer of endogenous sRNAs, we compared sRNAs profiles in bud tissues of an ungrafted `Gisela 6' rootstock, two sweet cherry `Emperor Francis' scions as well as their `Gisela 6' rootstocks. Over two million sRNAs were detected in each sweet cherry scion, where 21-nt sRNA (56.1\% and 55.8\%) being the most abundant, followed by 24-nt sRNAs (13.1\% and 12.5\%). Furthermore, we identified over three thousand sRNAs that were potentially transferred from the sweet cherry scions to their corresponding rootstocks. In contrast to the sRNAs in scions, among the transferred sRNAs in rootstocks, the most abundant were 24-nt sRNAs (46.3\% and 34.8\%) followed by 21-nt sRNAs (14.6\% and 19.3\%). In other words, 21-nt sRNAs had the least transferred proportion out of the total sRNAs in sources (scions) while 24-nt had the largest proportion. The transferred sRNAs were from 574 cherry transcripts, of which 350 had a match from theArabidopsis thalianastandard protein set. The finding that “DNA or RNA binding activity” was enriched in the transcripts producing transferred sRNAs indicated that they may affect the biological processes of the rootstocks at different regulatory levels. Overall, the profiles of the transported sRNAs and their annotations revealed in this study facilitate a better understanding of the role of the long-distance transported sRNAs in sweet cherry rootstock-scion interactions as well as in branch-to-branch interactions in a tree.},

	abstract = {Use of proper rootstocks has the potential to improve copper (Cu) tolerance of grape. To evaluate the rootstock ability to reduce Cu transfer in the aerial portion of a grapevine, a glasshouse experiment was conducted to determine the physiological impact of Cu soil application in `Asgari' seedless grape, either non-grafted or grafted onto different rootstocks. Vines were supplied with a nutrient solution at four levels of CuSO4 concentrations (0, 10, 25 and 50 mu M). Cu toxicity symptoms in leaves and reduced plant growth rate were evident in the non-grafted `Asgari' and less pronounced in grapevines grafted onto `Shahani' rootstock. Moreover, `Asgari' grafted onto `Shahani' rootstock had lower rate of Cu accumulation in the leaves when compared to the roots than those of non-grafted and `Asgari' with `Keshmeshi' rootstock. Although significant reduction of P in non-grafted `Asgari' leaf tissue was found under Cu toxicity, `Shahani' rootstock reported the highest amount of P (5.94 mg g(-1)) in the leaves of `Asgari' scion. However, significant fluctuations in terms of Ca and Fe were reported in leaves of both grafted and non-grafted `Asgari'. When exposed to Cu toxicity, `Shahani' rootstock induced significant increase in chlorophyll content, Fv/Fm ratio and a noticeable reduction in electrolyte leakage, H2O2 and malondialdehyde (MDA) compared to those having `Keshmeshi' rootstock and non-grafted `Asgari'. `Shahani' rootstock improved `Asgari' performance under Cu toxicity by slowly reducing the activity of antioxidant enzymes, preventing Cu accumulation in the aerial parts and maintaining a balanced scion nutritional status.},

However, global climate change has already negatively affected the biochemistry and functionality of such nutraceutical crops. The present study was conducted to reveal the effects of sustained deficit irrigation on certain features of seed extracts obtained from the grape cultivar `Prima' grafted on six genetically different rootstocks during two consecutive years. In both years, seed weight of `Prima' grapes grafted on 5 BB significantly decreased in response to water treatments, although the other rootstocks did not impair the seed weight, except for 44-53 \& x202f;M in 217. Significant decreases in antioxidant activity of the scion cultivar occurred in response to DI when grafted on 5 BB in both years and in 44-53 \& x202f;M in 2017. However, the use of 99 \& x202f;R, 110 \& x202f;R and 140 Ru did not markedly impair the seed antioxidant activity in response to DI condition in both years. In both years, seed anthocyanins of FI vines were always higher than those of DI vines. In 2017, there were significant decreases in anthocyanins due to DI in vines grafted on 5 BB, 44-53 \& x202f;M, 99 \& x202f;R and 110 \& x202f;R. These rootstocks also led significant decreases in anthocyanins of the second year, while the use of 140 Ru and 1613 \& x202f;C rootstocks did not lead significant changes in anthocyanins in both two years. In 2017, total phenolics increased in response to DI, except for the vines grafted on 44-53 \& x202f;M. Rootstock-dependent changes in total phenolics in response to irrigation treatments were insignificant for the vines grafted on 5 BB and 44-53 \& x202f;M in both two experimental years. Averaged data showed that antioxidant activity showed significantly positive correlation with anthocyanins and total phenols. The findings are anticipated to guide future projects on enhancement of the quality and quantity of precious seconder metabolites with sustainable precision viticulture techniques to match the globally increasing demands on bioactive compounds.},

Results Wines made from grapes harvested from own-rooted grapevines had the lowest content of (E)-3-hexenol, diethyl succinate and total ethyl esters and the highest content of 1-pentanol, 1-hexanol, (Z)-3-hexenol, diethyl malate and acetovanillone. Rootstocks such as 99R and 140Ru led to a higher content of total ethyl esters in wines followed by 110R, 1103P and Gravesac. According to odor activity values, Merlot wines were characterized by roses, sweat, cheese and banana aromas.

Benchmarking with Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) analysis of predicted gene models found 96\% of the complete BUSCOs in this assembly. The assembly continuity and completeness were further validated using V. riparia ESTs, BACs, and three de novo transcriptome assemblies of three different V. riparia genotypes resulting in {\textgreater}98\% of respective sequences/transcripts mapping with this assembly. Alignment of the V. riparia assembly and predicted CDS with the latest V. vinifera `PN40024' CDS and genome assembly showed 99\% CDS alignment and a high degree of synteny. An analysis of plant transcription factors indicates a high degree of homology with the V. vinifera transcription factors. QTL mapping to V. riparia `Manitoba 37' and V. vinifera PN40024 has identified genetic relationships to phenotypic variation between species.

Grafting is an affordable strategy to mitigate these negative consequences since the rootstock can increase the drought tolerance in the scion. This work explored the effects of pre-veraison water deficit on vines grafted on different rootstocks (Mgt 101-14 and 1103 Paulsen) to obtain physiological, biochemical, and molecular information about the influence on grape quality. Repeated measurements were carried out to assess vine physiology, production, technological maturity, and berry phenolic composition. qRT-PCRs were executed on berry skins at maturity to assess the expression levels of ten genes and five miRNAs involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway. Water stress caused significant alterations in grape technological maturity. The rootstock effect was not detected in primary metabolism while it was well defined in the accumulation of phenolic compounds in berries (such as anthocyanins). Finally, significant differences were identified in gene and miRNA expression between water-stressed and well-watered vines. In conclusion, the response to water stress can be modulated by rootstocks, which mainly act by regulating secondary metabolism, especially in grapes.},

	abstract = {Background In viticulture, rootstock genotype plays a critical role to improve scion physiology, berry quality and to adapt grapevine (Vitis viniferaL.) to different environmental conditions. This study aimed at investigating the effect of two different rootstocks (1103 Paulsen - P - and Mgt 101-14 - M) in comparison with not grafted plants - NGC - on transcriptome (RNA-seq and small RNA-seq) and chemical composition of berry skin inPinot noir, and exploring the influence of rootstock-scion interaction on grape quality. Berry samples, collected at veraison and maturity, were investigated at transcriptional and biochemical levels to depict the impact of rootstock on berry maturation. Results RNA- and miRNA-seq analyses highlighted that, at veraison, the transcriptomes of the berry skin are extremely similar, while variations associated with the different rootstocks become evident at maturity, suggesting a greater diversification at transcriptional level towards the end of the ripening process. In the experimental design, resembling standard agronomic growth conditions, the vines grafted on the two different rootstocks do not show a high degree of diversity. In general, the few genes differentially expressed at veraison were linked to photosynthesis, putatively because of a ripening delay in not grafted vines, while at maturity the differentially expressed genes were mainly involved in the synthesis and transport of phenylpropanoids (e.g. flavonoids), cell wall loosening, and stress response. These results were supported by some differences in berry phenolic composition detected between grafted and not grafted plants, in particular in resveratrol derivatives accumulation. Conclusions Transcriptomic and biochemical data demonstrate a stronger impact of 1103 Paulsen rootstock than Mgt 101-14 or not grafted plants on ripening processes related to the secondary metabolite accumulations in berry skin tissue. Interestingly, theMYB14gene, involved in the feedback regulation of resveratrol biosynthesis was up-regulated in 1103 Paulsen thus supporting a putative greater accumulation of stilbenes in mature berries.},

Principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and orthogonal-partial least squares discriminant analysis identified 30 significant metabolites and 22 metabolic pathways in the seeds of CS that differed significantly from the control seeds. This study revealed that rootstocks influence metabolite concentrations and metabolic pathways (alanine-aspartate-glutamate pathway, arginine-proline pathway, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle) in the scion onto which they are grafted. The rootstocks increased the concentration of delphinidin-3-(6-acetylglucoside), peonidin 3-(6-p-coumarylglucoside), L-threonine, and D-tartaric in CS seeds. Appropriate rootstock combinations can be used to improve the quality of grape seeds by changing the concentrations of amino acids, organic acids, polyphenols, and vitamin B.

	abstract = {Grafting is the most used propagation method in viticulture and is the unique control strategy against Phylloxera. Nevertheless, its practice remains limited mainly due to inconsistent graft success and difficulties in predicting graft compatibility responses of proposed scion-rootstock combinations, slowing down the selection of elite rootstocks. Aiming to identify optimal phenotypic parameters related to graft (in)compatibility, we used four clones of two grapevine cultivars that show different compatibility behavior when grafted onto the same rootstock. Several physiological parameters, internal anatomy of the graft union, chlorophyll fluorescence, and pigment contents of homo- and heterografts were monitored in a nursery-grafting context. The measurements highlighted enhanced performance of the heterografts due to rooting difficulties of Vitis vinifera homografts. This suggests that in viticulture, homografts should only be used as compatibility controls regarding qualitative attributes. By observing the internal anatomy of the union, we found that grapevines might require longer times for graft healing than anticipated. While Affinity Coefficients were not informative to assess incompatibility, leaf chlorophyll concentration analysis proved to be a more sensitive indicator of stress than the analysis of chlorophyll fluorescence. Overall, we conclude that graft take correlated best with callus formation at the graft junction three weeks after grafting.},

Pyrus betulaefolia Bunge, a drought-resistant pear rootstock that is commonly used in northern China, confers favourable characteristics to pear scions, allowing them to respond rapidly to drought stress via the transport of macromolecules such as phloem-mobile mRNAs. How drought-responsive mRNAs function as phloem-mobile signals remains unknown, however. Here, we used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) combined with SNP analysis to identify mobile mRNAs in P. betulaefolia. We focused on mobile mRNAs that respond to drought stress and found that the abundance of a novel mRNA named PbDRM (P. betulaefoliaDROUGHT-RESPONSIVE MOBILE GENE) significantly increased in several different scion cultivars when they were grafted onto P. betulaefolia rootstock under drought conditions. In addition, down-regulating PbDRM by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) increased the drought sensitivity of P. betulaefolia. CAPS RT-PCR analysis confirmed that PbDRM mRNA moves from rootstock to scion in micrografting systems. Therefore, PbDRM mRNA acts as a phloem-mobile signal in pear under drought stress.},

In this context, we sought to investigate the responses to climate change of two Prunus rootstocks (GF677 and Adesoto) budded with Catherina peach cultivar. Plants were grown in 15 L pots in temperature gradient greenhouses for an 18 days acclimation period after which six treatments were applied: [CO2 levels (400 versus 700 mu mol mol(-1)), temperature (ambient versus ambient + 4 degrees C), and water availability (well irrigated versus drought)]. After 23 days, the effects of stress were evaluated as changes in physiological and biochemical traits, including expression of relevant genes. Stem water potential decreased under drought stress in plants grafted on GF677 and Adesoto rootstocks; however, elevated CO2 and temperature affected plant water content differently in both combinations. The photosynthetic rate of plants grafted on GF677 increased under high CO2, but decreased under high temperature and drought conditions. The photosynthetic rates of plants grafted onto Adesoto were only affected by drought treatment. Furthermore, in GF677-Catherina plants, elevated CO2 alleviated the effect of drought, whereas in those grafted onto Adesoto, the same condition produced acclimation in the rate. Stomatal conductance decreased under high CO2 and drought stress in both grafted rootstocks, and the combination of these conditions improved water-use efficiency. Changes in the sugar content in scion leaves and roots were significantly different under the stress conditions in both combinations. Meanwhile, the expression of most of the assessed genes was significantly affected by treatment. Regarding genotypes, GF677 rootstock showed more changes at the molecular and transcriptomic level than did Adesoto rootstock. A coordinated shift was found between the physiological status and the transcriptomic responses. This study revealed adaptive responses to climate change at the physiological, metabolic, and transcriptomic levels in two Prunus rootstocks budded with `Catherina'. Overall, these results demonstrate the resilient capacity and plasticity of these contrasting genotypes, which can be further used to combat ongoing climate changes and support sustainable peach production.},

	abstract = {Background: Grafting with rootstocks is essential for the culture of many perennial fruit crops and is increasing being used in the production of annual fruits and vegetables. Our previous work based on microarrays showed that transcripts encoding enzymes of both primary and secondary metabolism were differentially expressed during graft union formation in both homo-grafts (a genotype grafted with itself) and hetero-grafts (two different genotypes grafted together). The aim of this study was to profile primary and secondary metabolites, and quantify the activity of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and neutral invertase (NI) in the scion and rootstock tissues and the graft interface of homo and hetero-grafts of grapevine 1 month after grafting. Table-top grafting was done on over-wintering stems (canes) of grapevine and the graft interface tissues (containing some woody stem tissues and callus) were compared to the surrounding rootstock and scion tissues. The objective was to identify compounds involved in graft union formation and hetero-grafting responses. Results: A total of 54 compounds from primary and secondary metabolism (19 amino acids, five primary and 30 secondary compounds metabolites) and the activity of two enzymes were measured. The graft interface was associated with an increase in the accumulation of the branched-chain amino acids, basic amino acids, certain stilbene compounds and higher PAL and NI activity in comparison to the surrounding woody stem tissues. Some amino acids and stilbenes were identified as being accumulated differently between the graft interfaces of the scion/rootstock combinations in a manner which was unrelated to their concentrations in the surrounding woody stem tissues. Conclusions: This study revealed the modification of primary metabolism to support callus cell formation and the stimulation of stilbene synthesis at the graft interface, and how these processes are modified by hetero-grafting. Knowledge of the metabolites and/or enzymes required for successful graft union formation offer us the potential to identify markers that could be used by nurseries and researchers for selection and breeding purposes.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims: Rootstocks play an essential role in grapevine scion growth and development. They influence water and nutrient uptake and affect biomass allocation of the scion and the grape berry composition connected with wine quality. Nitrogen (N) can be taken up by the roots in various forms such as nitrate, ammonium or urea. These N-forms and their possible differential assimilation directly and indirectly influence grapevine vegetative and generative growth. N assimilation is driven by N acquiring enzymes such as nitrate reductase (NR), nitrite reductase (NiR) and glutamine synthetase (GS). This assimilation physiology can be influenced by factors such as light conditions or substrate availability. Methods: Hydroponically grown grapevine rootstocks were fertilized with various N-forms, namely calcium nitrate (CaN), ammonium (AM), urea (UR), and glutamine (Gln). The transcript expression of the enzymes NR, NiR and GS and the enzymatic nitrate reductase activity (eNRA) were examined at various time points (0 h, 3 h, and 6 h) after N application. Results and Conclusion: The data suggest that the grapevine rootstock SO4 has the ability to assimilate the amino acid Gln. Furthermore, AM, UR, and in some organs Gln, can regulate the co-enzymes NR and NiR, both of which function as activators of the NO3 - assimilation process. The eNRA is clearly defined by the plant organ.},

In this study, the annual hard-branch 5BB as rootstock and Cabernet Sauvignon as scion of grafted grape propagules were treated with water (as control), bud picking and different gradients of growth regulators, including rooting powder (ABT No. 2) and chlorpropham (CIPC) to adjust the growth competition between the germination of the scion and the callus formation of the graft union and to improve the survival rate of grafted grape propagules. This study lasted for two years (2017-2018). Results showed that 250 mg/L of ABT inhibited scion sprouting, promoted callus formation, rootstock rooting and had the highest survival rate with significant effect. However, CIPC inhibited the growth indexes of grafted grape propagules and reduced the survival rate. Bud picking delayed the germination time and increased the callus formation rate. Furthermore, ABT and CIPC could regulate sugar accumulation and the metabolic activities of related enzymes such as sucrose synthase (SS), sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) and alpha-amylase (alpha-AMS) in the scion bud and the phloem near the graft union. Meanwhile, ABT and CIPC had a distribution regulating effect on auxin (IAA), gibberellic acid (GA3), zeatin riboside (ZR) and abscisic acid (ABA), whereas bud picking had no significant effect on the accumulation of sugar and endogenous hormones. Correlation analysis showed that sucrose, glucose, IAA and ZR near the graft union had a significant positive correlation with callus formation, starch and sucrose accumulation in the scion buds, whereas the accumulation of ABA in the phloem near the graft union negatively regulated the callus formation. This study demonstrated that ABT and CIPC affected the survival rate of grafted grape propagules by regulating the metabolism and distribution of sugar and endogenous hormones.},

Water deficit reduced all growth and physiological traits especially in CS. R32 rootstock induced significantly higher values for most traits irrespective of cv and seasons associated to higher root growth. Transcriptomic analysis was further performed in both cultivars grafted over R32 rootstock by RNA-Seq, determining that gene up-regulation extent was higher in Sy. More stable transcriptional landscape was determined in CS than Sy, which might be linked to its hydric strategy. Unexpectedly, major differences in transcriptional behaviour were detected in R32 rootstock, revealing major transcriptional changes occurring at root level, suggesting scion-driven transcriptional regulation in response to stress. Finally, R32 rootstock can be considered for both near iso and anisohydric grapevines as adaptive strategy for climate constrains.},

	abstract = {Background and aims: In most viticultural areas of the world, Vitis vinifera grapevines require grafting onto phylloxera-tolerant rootstocks of American origin. The species most commonly used in rootstock creation are Vitis berlandieri, V. riparia and V. rupestris. Rootstocks not only provide tolerance to phylloxera but also ensure the supply of water and mineral nutrients to the scion. The aim of the study was to investigate the extent to which rootstocks with different genetic backgrounds modify the mineral composition of the petioles of the scion. Methods and results: Vitis vinifera cv. Cabernet-Sauvignon grapevines were grafted onto rootstocks of 13 different genotypes and planted in a vineyard in three blocks. Petiolar concentrations of 13 mineral elements at veraison (berry softening) were determined. The genetic background of the rootstock had significant effects on the mineral composition of the petioles. Use of rootstocks with a genetic background including at least one Vitis riparia parent decreased the concentration of phosphorus and magnesium and increased the concentration of sulphur in the petioles of Cabernet-Sauvignon. Conclusion: Rootstocks with a Vitis riparia genetic background confer low petiolar concentrations of phosphorus and magnesium, and conversely, high petiolar concentration of sulphur. Significance of the study: The kind of rootstock onto which a grapevine has been grafted is known to influence the nutrient content of the scion. The results of the study show a significant relation between the genetic background of a rootstock and its ability to modify concentrations of phosphorus, magnesium and sulphur in the petioles of the scion under field conditions.},

Recently, a higher occurrence of cankers was observed on 1-year-old apple trees in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. This study aimed to assess the phytosanitary status of nursery trees and propagation material as possible inoculum sources for canker pathogens. Thirteen 1-year-old apple orchards showing canker or dieback symptoms were sampled. Certified nursery apple trees were collected from four nurseries as well as scion and rootstock mother plant material. Isolations were made from the discoloration observed in the vascular tissue of the plant parts and from asymptomatic material. Possible canker and wood rot species were identified with PCR and sequence comparisons of the relevant gene regions and phylogenetic analyses. Similar canker and wood rot species were isolated from 1-year-old diseased apple trees, nursery apple trees, and the propagation material. Forty-five fungal species associated with canker or wood rot symptoms were identified. The top five most abundant fungal species found causing disease on commercial 1-year-old trees were also found in high numbers causing latent infection in certified apple nursery trees. These species were Didymosphaeria rubi-ulmifolii sensu lato, Diplodia seriata, Schizophyllum commune, Didymella pomorum, and Coniochaeta fasciculata, with D. rubi-ulmifolii sensu lato being the dominant species in both sampling materials. In all, 65\% of certified nursery apple trees, 5\% of scion shoots used for budding, and 21\% of rooted rootstock cuttings from layer blocks had latent infections of canker and wood rot pathogens. Pathogenicity trials were conducted with isolates of 39 species, inoculated onto 2-year-old branches of 14-year-old Golden Delicious trees. All species caused lesions that were significantly longer than the control. This study confirmed the presence of canker and wood rot pathogens in apple propagation material as well as certified nursery apple trees, which will aid the improvement of management practices in nurseries.},

Knowledge on potential effects of a combined abiotic-biotic stress on whole-plant physiology is lacking. We monitored the water status and carbon metabolism of a vine rootstock with or without scion subjected to water shortening and/or infestation with the sucking insect phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae Fitch). We measured non-structural carbohydrates and biomass of different plant organs to assess the stress-induced responses at the root, stem, and leaf level. Effects of watering on root infestation were also addressed. Results: Higher root infestation was observed in drought-stressed plants compared to well-watered. The drought had a significant impact on most of the measured functional traits. Phylloxera further influenced vines water and carbon metabolism and enforced the sink strength of the roots by stimulating photosynthates translocation. The insect induced carbon depletion, reprogramed vine development, while preventing biomass compensation. A synergic effect of biotic-abiotic stress could be detected in several physiological and morphological traits. Conclusions: Our results indicate that events of water shortage favour insects' feeding damage and increase the abundance of root nodosities. Root phylloxera infestation imposes a considerable stress to the plants which might exacerbate the negative effects of drought.},

We produced self and reciprocal grafts involving non-transgenic blueberry (NT) and transgenic blueberry (T) carrying a 35S-driven blueberry FT (VcFT-OX). We demonstrated that the transgenic VcFT-OX rootstock promoted flowering of non-transgenic blueberry scions in the NT (scion):T (rootstock) grafts. We further analyzed RNA-Seq profiles and six groups of phytohormones in both NT:T and NT:NT plants. We observed content changes of several hormone metabolites, in a descending order, in the transgenic NT:T, non-transgenic NT:T, and non-transgenic NT:NT leaves. By comparing differential expression transcripts (DETs) of these tissues in relative to their control, we found that the non-transgenic NT:T leaves had many DETs shared with the transgenic NT:T leaves, but very few with the transgenic NT:T roots. Interestingly, a number of these shared DETs belong to hormone pathway genes, concurring with the content changes of hormone metabolites in both transgenic and non-transgenic leaves of the NT:T plants. These results suggest that phytohormones induced by VcFT-OX in the transgenic leaves might serve as part of the signals that resulted in early flowering in both transgenic plants and the non-transgenic NT:T scions.},

Here we analyse scion-rootstock interactions in mature vines growing in a heavy clay soil in a climate characterised by severe summer drought to investigate the effect of the scion-rootstock interaction in a suboptimal soil. Methods and Results The rootstocks, 34 Ecole de Montpellier, 140 Ruggeri and 1103 Paulsen, were grafted onto Nerello Mascalese and Nero d'Avola scions and assessed along with self-rooted vines. Root distribution and root architecture were analysed using the profile wall method at 0, 60 and 120 cm from the row midline. Root density was greatest at a depth between 21 and 60 cm. The cumulative root fraction for root density registered a beta value, a numerical quantity that summarises depth distribution, ranging between 0.932 and 0.962. Root number and density were significantly lower for the self-rooted vines compared to that of the grafted vines. Conclusions The scion genotypes affected most developmental parameters, including the diameter of the root system, the root density at 21-80 cm depth and the ratio of fine roots to coarse roots.

	abstract = {Controversies exist regarding the iso/anisohydric continuum for classifying plant water-use strategies. Isohydricity has been argued to result from plant-environment interaction rather than it being an intrinsic property of the plant itself. Discrepancies remain regarding the degree of isohydricity (sigma) of plants and their threshold for physiological responses and resistance to drought. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the isohydricity of the grapevine varieties Syrah and Carmenere under a non-lethal water deficit progression from veraison from two different locations, the Cachapoal Valley (CV) and Maipo Valley (MV), in central Chile and with different rootstock only in Syrah. For this purpose, the midday stem water potential (psi(mds)) regulation and stomatal responses to drought, leaf traits related to pressure-volume curves, stomatal sensitivity to ABA, cavitation threshold, and photosynthetic responses were assessed. A higher atmospheric water demand was observed in the CV compared to the MV, with lower psi(mds) values in the former for both varieties. Also, the sigma values in Carmenere were 1.11 +/- 0.14 MPa MPa-1 and 0.68 +/- 0.18 MPa MPa-1 in the CV and MV, respectively, and in Syrah they were 1.10 +/- 0.07 MPa MPa-1 in the CV and 0.60 +/- 0.10 MPa MPa-1 in the MV. Even though similar variations in sigma between locations in both varieties were evident, Carmenere plants showed a conserved stomatal response to psi(mds) in both study sites, while those of Syrah resulted in a higher stomatal sensitivity to psi(mds) in the site of lower sigma. Besides the differences in seasonal weather conditions, it is likely that the different rootstock and clonal variability of each season in Syrah were able to induce coordinated changes in sigma, psi(gs12), and osmotic potential at full turgor (pi(0)). On the other hand, irrespective of the sigma, and given the similarity between the pi(0) and psi(gs12) in leaves before drought, it seems that pi(0) could be a convenient tool for assessing the psi(mds) threshold values posing a risk to the plants in order to aid the irrigation decision making in grapevines under controlled water deficit. Finally, water deficits in vineyards might irreversibly compromise the photosynthetic capacity of leaves.},

	abstract = {Main conclusion In grape (Vitis), stilbene phytoalexins can either be in situ synthesized or transported to the site of response during powdery mildew infection, enhancing disease resistance. Resveratrol is a phytoprotective stilbenoid compound that is synthesized by stilbene synthase (STS) in response to biotic and abiotic stresses, and is also known to have health benefits in the human diet. We have previously shown that transgenic Vitis vinifera cv. Thompson Seedless plants overexpressing a stilbene synthase gene, VqSTS6, from wild Chinese Vitis quinquangularis had a higher stilbenoid content, leading to an enhanced resistance to powdery mildew (Uncinula necator (Schw.) Burr). However, the biosynthesis and transportation in the plant tissue under powdery mildew infection are still unclear. Here, inhibitor and micro-grafting technologies were used to study the accumulation of resveratrol following powdery mildew infection. We observed that the levels of STS expression and stilbenoids increased in response to powdery mildew infection. Powdery mildew and inhibitor treatment on detached grape branches showed that resveratrol was in situ synthesized. Experiments with grafted plantlets showed that the abundance of stilbenoid compounds increased in the shoot during VqSTS6 overexpression in the root, while VqSTS6-Flag fusion was not tranported to the scions and only expressed in the transgenic rootstocks. Compared with wild-type Thompson Seedless plants, the non-transgenic/VqSTS6 transgenic (scion/rootstock) grafted Thompson Seedless plantlets exhibited increased resistance to powdery mildew. In addition, overexpression of VqSTS6 in roots led to increased levels of stilbenoid compounds in five other European grape varieties (V. vinifera cvs. Chardonnay, Perlette, Cabernet Sauvignon, Riesling and Muscat Hamburg). In conclusion, stilbenoid compounds can be either in situ synthesized or transported to the site of powdery mildew infection, and overexpression of VqSTS6 in the root promotes stilbenoids accumulation and disease resistance in European grapevine varieties.},

Two scion/rootstock combinations, with different levels of compatibility, were compared in a nursery-grafting context at two stages, at 21 and 80 days after grafting. Results In the most compatible combination, an earlier and higher expression of genes signaling the metabolic and hormonal pathways as well as a reduced expression of genes of the phenolic metabolism and of the oxidative stress response was observed. At 80 days after grafting a higher expression of transcription factors regulating vascular maintenance, differentiation and proliferation was obtained in the most compatible combination. Moreover, lower expression levels of microRNAs potentially targeting important transcription factors related to plant development was observed in the more compatible combination when compared to the less compatible one.

The grapevine response to combined abiotic and biotic stresses is complex and cannot be inferred from the response to each single stress. Several factors might impact the response and the recovery of the grapevine, such as the intensity, duration, and timing of the stresses. In the heat/water stressGTDsgrapevine interaction, the nature of the pathogens, and the host, i.e., the nature of the rootstock, the cultivar and the clone, has a great importance. This review highlights the lack of studies investigating the response to combined stresses, in particular molecular studies, and the misreading of the relationship between rootstock and scion in the relationship GTDs/abiotic stresses.Grapevine trunk diseases (GTDs) are one of the biggest threats to vineyard sustainability in the next 30years. Although many treatments and practices are used to manage GTDs, there has been an increase in the prevalence of these diseases due to several factors such as vineyard intensification, aging vineyards, or nursery practices. The ban of efficient treatments, i.e., sodium arsenite, carbendazim, and benomyl, in the early 2000s may be partly responsible for the fast spread of these diseases. However, GTD-associated fungi can act as endophytes for several years on, or inside the vine until the appearance of the first symptoms. This prompted several researchers to hypothesise that abiotic conditions, especially thermal and water stresses, were involved in the initiation of GTD symptoms. Unfortunately, the frequency of these abiotic conditions occurring is likely to increase according to the recent consensus scenario of climate change, especially in wine-growing areas. In this article, following a review on the impact of combined thermal and water stresses on grapevine physiology, we will examine (1) how this combination of stresses might influence the lifestyle of GTD pathogens, (2) learnings from grapevine field experiments and modelling aiming at studying biotic and abiotic stresses, and (3) what mechanistic concepts can be used to explain how these stresses might affect the grapevine plant status.},

This plentiful biomass is known to be rich in stilbenes and can be used as a source of high-value compounds as well as active natural extracts. However, the stilbenes in grapevine wood and roots from different cultivars and rootstocks remain to be characterized. Objective The present study investigated the stilbene content of eight major Vitis vinifera cultivars and six different rootstocks. In addition, the distribution of stilbenes was established for each of seven parts into which the plants were sub-divided. Methodology For stilbene characterization and quantification purposes, an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-DAD-MS/MS) analysis of different samples was carried out. Moreover, structural data of stilbenes was unambiguously studied by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra. Results Whatever the cultivar/rootstock combination, stilbenes were found to be oligomerized from the aerial part to the root system. Furthermore, stilbene content varied widely depending on the cultivars and rootstocks. For instance, the cultivars Merlot, Tannat and Gamay noir were the richest in stilbenes while the rootstocks Gravesac, Fercal and 3390C contained the highest amounts. Conclusion These findings provide insight into the knowledge that major grapevine cultivars and rootstocks can be used as a potential source of complex stilbenes.},

However, limited knowledge exists on the effects of the adoption of a specific rootstock on grape and wine phenolic composition, which contribute to certain sensory attributes such as color, body and astringency of wine. These compounds are mainly affected by the variety, viticultural management and rootstock. The aim of this work was to study the influence of eight rootstocks on grape anthocyanin content, skin and seed proanthocyanidins and wine chromatic characteristics obtained from Merlot vines. RESULTS Grapevines grafted onto SO4 rootstock, in general, presented a higher concentration of total proanthocyanidins in skins and seeds compared to the rest of the rootstocks, whereas grapevines grafted onto Gravesac presented a lower concentration of proanthocyanidins in skins and seeds. These differences were found in the wines developed from grapevines grafted onto SO4. Wines from grapevines grafted onto SO4, 140 Ruggeri, Gravesac and 4453 M rootstocks presented, in general, better chromatic characteristics and a higher anthocyanin and tannin content than the rest of the samples.

Greenhouse grown, grapevines of cv. Sultana (Vitis vinifera L.) grafted onto two rootstocks and on own roots, were subjected to three drought stress levels (NS: no-stress, MS: moderate stress and SS: severe stress). The results indicated that under SS, relative water content in KA-grafted was similar to that in un-grafted Sultana under MS. Moreover, leaf area decreased under SS compared MS. Furthermore, KA-grafted exhibited the highest value of leaf fresh mass. The leaf dry mass for un-grafted Sultana was significantly lower than grafted vines and, the values of leaf tissue density for the three rootstocks were lower than control. Under MS, the leaf thickness of Sultana on KA exhibited an increase, while the other rootstocks followed a decreasing trend under SS. Also un-grafted Sultana had a higher specific leaf area compared to grafted vines. The amounts of leaf chlorophyll in Sultana on KA and QG were significantly higher than un-grafted vines. KA-grafted improved photosynthesis rate of Sultana scion compared to the own-rooted plants in all experimental drought conditions. Additionally, the transpiration for Sultana scion leaves had declined compared to un-grafted plants. Significant interactions were observed between stress levels and rootstocks on the water use efficiency. Concluding, in his experiment KA rootstock could be better performance compared to QG and un-grafted Sultana to drought stress.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims Grafted grapevines are a key component of modern viticulture. Grafting provides not only resistance to soil-borne pests, but can also improve adaptability to the environment and can improve fruit yield and quality. Graft incompatibility induced by grapevine viruses causes damage to vineyards worldwide. The aim of the present study was to create a rapid and reliable means of evaluating graft incompatibility resulting from grafting virus-infected scions onto healthy grape rootstocks. Methods and Results Scions of Control (healthy Cabernet Franc), LR131 (Cabernet Franc infected with GLRaV-1) and LR132 (Cabernet Franc infected with GLRaV-1 and GVA) were grafted onto different rootstocks by micrografting, green grafting and bench grafting methods. All the micrografts infected with LR132 failed, while LR131 and Control micrografts had similar survival rates. The impact of LR132 was less severe on green grafted plants, followed by bench grafts. Analysis of variance showed an interaction of grafting method x virus variety x rootstock, affecting grafting survival. When grafted onto Freedom and 101-14, LR131 inhibited the growth of both scion and rootstock, but no significant impact was seen when LR131 was grafted onto St. George and AXR1. Well-established callus was visible between the surfaces of LR131 and the rootstocks. The virus GLRaV-1 was detected moving from the LR131 scion source to rootstocks 7 days after micrografting. Callus formation was delayed by LR132 between scion and rootstock surfaces, and a scion-rootstock vascular connection did not establish, resulting in the death of all micrografts. Conclusions Micrografting is a reliable and sensitive method to screen for virus tolerant graft combinations compared with green and bench grafting. Significance of the Study The results of the present study validate micrografting as a means of producing credible information for selection of virus tolerant rootstocks, and ultimately vineyards with higher rates of compatible grafts.},

	abstract = {Diminishing availability of non-saline water in arid and semiarid regions is of concern to all irrigated agricultural producers, including wine and grape producers. Grapes are not a salt tolerant crop and producers often face the choice of either limiting fresh water application, using alternative saline waters or a combination of both. We examined the salt tolerance and effect of restricted water application on three purported salt tolerant rootstocks grafted to Cabernet Sauvignon scion in a 4-year replicated field experiment. ANOVA indicated significant effects of salinity water stress and rootstock on fruit yields. The 140 Ruggeri scion was the top producer across all treatments including control, followed by Salt Creek, with St. George significantly less productive than 140 Ruggeri across all treatments. In terms of salt tolerance, Salt Creek and 140 Ruggeri were not statistically different but St. George was significantly less tolerant than Salt Creek. In terms of drought tolerance (relative yield), there were no statistical differences among rootstocks. Soil salinity profiles and soil moisture sensors indicated reduced water consumption under high salinity, thus no matric stress under 60\% of optimal water application when high salt stress was present. The multiplicative stress model where salt and water stress are individually evaluated did not satisfactorily predict yield under combined salinity and reduced water application, likely due to decreased water consumption under saline conditions. Short term (one year) experiments underestimate salt damage to grape vines as salt tolerance decreased over the 4-year experiment.},

Grafting is a common horticultural practice that joins the roots (rootstock) of one plant to the shoot (scion) of another, providing an excellent method for investigating how these two organ systems affect each other. In this study, we used the French-American hybrid grapevine `Chambourcin' (Vitis L.) as a model to explore the rootstock-scion relationship. We examined leaf shape, ion concentrations, and gene expression in `Chambourcin' grown ungrafted as well as grafted to three different rootstocks ('SO4', `1103P' and `3309C') across 2 years and three different irrigation treatments. We found that a significant amount of the variation in leaf shape could be explained by the interaction between rootstock and irrigation. For ion concentrations, the primary source of variation identified was the position of a leaf in a shoot, although rootstock and rootstock by irrigation interaction also explained a significant amount of variation for most ions. Lastly, we found rootstock-specific patterns of gene expression in grafted plants when compared to ungrafted vines. Thus, our work reveals the subtle and complex effect of grafting on `Chambourcin' leaf morphology, ionomics, and gene expression.},

	abstract = {Reliable assessment of grapevine productivity is a destructive and time-consuming process. In addition, the mixed effects of grapevine water status and scion-rootstock interactions on grapevine productivity are not always linear. Despite the potential opportunity of applying remote sensing and machine learning techniques to predict plant traits, there are still limitations to previously studied techniques for vine productivity due to the complexity of the system not being adequately modeled. During the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons, hyperspectral reflectance spectra were collected using a handheld spectroradiometer in a vineyard designed to investigate the effects of irrigation level (0\%, 50\%, and 100\%) and rootstocks (1103 Paulsen, 3309 Couderc, SO4 and Chambourcin) on vine productivity. To assess vine productivity, it is necessary to measure factors related to fruit ripeness and not just yield, as an over cropped vine may produce high-yield but poor-quality fruit. Therefore, yield, Total Soluble Solids (TSS), Titratable Acidity (TA) and the ratio TSS/TA (maturation index, IMAD) were measured. A total of 20 vegetation indices were calculated from hyperspectral data and used as input for predictive model calibration. Prediction performance of linear/nonlinear multiple regression methods and Weighted Regularized Extreme Learning Machine (WRELM) were compared with our newly developed WRELM-TanhRe. The developed method is based on two activation functions: hyperbolic tangent (Tanh) and rectified linear unit (ReLU). The results revealed that WRELM and WRELM-TanhRe outperformed the widely used multiple regression methods when model performance was tested with an independent validation dataset. WRELM-TanhRe produced the highest prediction accuracy for all the berry yield and quality parameters (R-2 of 0.522-0.682 and RMSE of 2-15\%), except for TA, which was predicted best with WRELM (R-2 of 0.545 and RMSE of 6\%). The results demonstrate the value of combining hyperspectral remote sensing and machine learning methods for improving of berry yield and quality prediction.},

	abstract = {Grapevines are perennial plants that can display remarkable longevity. It is often thought that some of their characteristics evolve in a positive way as they grow older, such as having a higher tolerance to water deficit and an improved balance between vegetative and reproductive growth. However, only a few studies have been conducted so far on the possible effects of age on vine productivity and water status. An experimental vineyard was designed in the German Rheingau region to compare vines of identical planting material planted at three different times. The vineyard was established in 1971 with Vitis vinifera (L.) cv. Riesling vines (clone Gm 239-17) grafted on 5C Teleki and trained in double Guyot and cordon in alternating rows. In 1995 and 2012, rows of both training systems were uprooted and replanted with the same scion/rootstock combination. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of vine age on several physiological and reproductive parameters. Vines planted in 2012 were generally more sensitive to water deficit than vines planted in 1995 and 1971, although this depended on the amount of precipitations during the growing season. A supporting trial was carried to create more intense drought conditions by deploying a plastic mulch around selected vines during rain events. Young vines were most affected by the treatment, suggesting that their lower trolerance to water deficit might be due to a shallower root system. Vines planted in 1995 and 1971 displayed similar response to water deficit. Canopy architecture, cluster parameters and vine balance components including pruning weight and yield were different for the youngest vines until the fifth year after planting due to their lower cropping capacity. Even though the observed yield and pruning weight per meter were lower for grapevines planted in 1971 than those planted in 1995, these variables were similar across the two age groups when missing vines were taken into account. Wood diseases were identified as the main factor behind the decline of old vines. The study suggests that the management of wood diseases is a key component in improving vineyard longevity, and that the conservation of grape yield and technological maturity parameters for vineyards in similar environmental conditions is indeed possible over the long term.},

Grafting is a complex phenomenon, involving anatomical, physiological, biochemical and molecular interactions between the scion and the rootstock. For this reason, the lack of graft success is a complex problem to study. However, it is believed that through a joint analysis of the different mechanisms of graft success, one can advance more quickly in the knowledge of this phenomenon. Despite the scarce information available on the role of phenolic compounds in Vitis grafts, an analytical method was developed and validated for phenolic compounds quantification in vine graft tissues reviling some chemical markers for the cv. `Syrah' with 11OR and SO4 rootstocks. This work aims to determine, among phenolic acids and two flavanols, the chemical markers of graft compatibility between scions from two clones of cv. `Touriga Nacional' (TN 21 and TN 112) and the rootstock 110R. For this purpose, extracts of grafting tissues were prepared at three different locations (above, below and at the grafting union), and were analyzed in three different stages of the grafting cycle. From all sections analyzed, the graft union tissue is the one to discriminate better the two combinations. Gallic acid, catechin and sinapic acid were found in higher amount at graft union in the less compatible combination later in graft development. Furthermore, the chlorogenic acid had a higher content in the more compatible combination at the early stage when compared to the less compatible graft.},

Given the numerous environments where this plant can be found, and the huge intra- and interspecific diversity, we can assume that grapevine genomes contain many alleles that could be exploited to ensure the sustainability of viticulture. The challenge is to identify these alleles and to understand how they can be used to manipulate phenotypes. The diversity of abiotic constraints (thermal stress, drought, salinity, mineral deficiency, etc.) and their timing, duration, and intensity must be taken into account. The traits that underlie plant adaptation and the sensitive stages of development should be clearly defined. Targeted traits are often complex and under the control of various genetic mechanisms. Over the past 10 years, there have been numerous achievements in grapevine research such as genome sequencing, phenotyping improvement, genetics, functional characterization of genes, and modeling. Thanks to new knowledge and technologies, our understanding of grapevine adaptation to abiotic stresses has improved and can now be used to screen existing germplasms or to breed new genotypes.

	abstract = {Background: Drought is an important constraint on grapevine sustainability. Vitis riparia, widely used in rootstock and scion breeding, has been studied in isolated leaf drying response studies; however, it is essential to identify key root and shoot water deficit signaling traits in intact plants. This information will aid improved scion and rootstock selection and management practices in grapevine. RNAseq data were generated from V. riparia roots and shoots under water deficit and well-watered conditions to determine root signaling and shoot responses to water deficit. Results: Shoot elongation, photosynthetic rate, and stomatal conductance were significantly reduced in water deficit (WD) treated than in well-watered grapevines. RNAseq analysis indicated greater transcriptional differences in shoots than in roots under WD, with 6925 and 1395 genes differentially expressed, respectively (q-value {\textless}0.05). There were 50 and 25 VitisNet pathways significantly enriched in WD relative to well-watered treatments in grapevine shoots and roots, respectively. The ABA biosynthesis genes beta-carotene hydroxylase, zeaxanthin epoxidase, and 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenases were up-regulated in WD root and WD shoot. A positive enrichment of ABA biosynthesis genes and signaling pathways in WD grapevine roots indicated enhanced root signaling to the shoot. An increased frequency of differentially expressed reactive oxygen species scavenging (ROS) genes were found in the WD shoot. Analyses of hormone signaling genes indicated a strong ABA, auxin, and ethylene network and an ABA, cytokinin, and circadian rhythm network in both WD shoot and WD root. Conclusions: This work supports previous findings in detached leaf studies suggesting ABA-responsive binding factor 2 (ABF2) is a central regulator in ABA signaling in the WD shoot. Likewise, ABF2 may have a key role in V. riparia WD shoot and WD root. A role for ABF3 was indicated only in WD root. WD shoot and WD root hormone expression analysis identified strong ABA, auxin, ethylene, cytokinin, and circadian rhythm signaling networks. These results present the first ABA, cytokinin, and circadian rhythm signaling network in roots under water deficit. These networks point to organ specific regulators that should be explored to further define the communication network from soil to shoot.},

	abstract = {A field study showed that transgenic grapevine rootstocks can provide trans-graft-mediated protection to a wild type scion against Pierce's disease (PD) development. We individually field-tested two distinct strategies. The first expressed a chimeric antimicrobial protein (CAP) that targeted the functionality of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) surface of Xylella fastidiosa (Xf), the causative agent of PD. The second expressed a plant polygalacturonase inhibitory protein (PGIP) that prevents PD by inhibiting breakdown of pectin present in primary cell walls. Both proteins are secreted to the apoplast and then into the xylem, where they migrate past the graft union, transiting into the xylem of the grafted scion. Transgenic Vitis vinifera cv. Thompson Seedless (TS) expressing ether CAP or PGIP were tested in the greenhouse and those lines that showed resistance to PD were grafted with wild type TS scions. Grafted grapevines were introduced into the field and tested over 7 years. Here we present data on the field evaluation of trans-graft protection using four CAP and four PGIP independent rootstock lines, compared to an untransformed rootstock. There was 30 to 95\% reduction in vine mortality among CAP-and PGIP-expressing lines after three successive yearly infections with virulent Xf. Shoot tissues grafted to either CAP or PGIP transgenic rootstocks supported lower pathogen titers and showed fewer disease symptoms. Grafted plants on transgenic rootstocks also had more spring bud break following infection, more shoots, and more vigorous growth compared to those grafted to wild type rootstocks. No yield penalty was observed in the transgenic lines and some PGIP-expressing vines had enhanced yield potential. Trans-graft protection is an efficient way to protect grape scions against PD while preserving their valuable varietal genotypes and clonal properties.},

	abstract = {Regulation of root system growth and architecture is an adaptive mechanism evolved by plants to cope with variable nitrogen availability in the soil. In grafted plants, this process depends on intrinsic properties of the rootstock as well as long-distance signaling between each partner of the graft (scion and rootstock) and contributes to the fitness of the whole plant. We show here that two grapevine rootstock genotypes known to differentially control scion growth have developed two distinct root development strategies to optimize nutrient uptake in response to nitrogen availability. The rootstock `1103 Paulsen' conferring high vigor developed a deeper root system and a larger number of lateral roots than `Riparia Gloire de Montpellier' (RGM), a rootstock that confers low vigor, whatever the nitrogen concentration in the culture medium. RGM cuttings grew surface roots and developed lateral roots only with low nitrogen supply. This developmental pattern suggests that RGM promotes lateral root production when nitrogen content is limiting to increase its prospecting area for the uptake of nitrogen resources. Gene expression profiling revealed interesting patterns and differences between the two studied rootstocks, particularly concerning hormone signaling.},

	abstract = {Pest and disease pressures have traditionally driven the use of grapevine rootstocks. However, with competing demands on limited water resources and changing climate conditions, the water available for agriculture will likely continue to diminish. This inevitability has resulted in an increased interest in grape rootstock effects on scion growth, specifically yield components, as a function of parentage and in terms of drought tolerance. It has also spurred efforts to breed new rootstocks with combined pest, disease, and abiotic stress resistance. Field studies examining rootstock effect on scion growth and development have been inconsistent due to complications associated with varying soil types and weather factors unique to each site. Other factors tend to vary from site to site including trellising systems, scion cultivar selection and management practices, each of which also has a role in determining vine phenology. Due to these issues, rootstock trial data is often presented on a site-by-site basis with the objective of determining if a specific rootstock tends to yield more or less than other rootstocks on a given site. Although inherently limited by the aforementioned challenges, rootstock trails are arguably one of the best methods of providing insight into rootstock performance and scion interactions. The Wolpert rootstock trails in California were one of the more comprehensive efforts to understand and classify rootstock performance as a function of site. General trends in performance were observed as a function of rootstock selection with regard to yield and pruning weights.},

Since nitrogen (N) availability is a major driver of grapevine growth, understanding N metabolism regulation by both grafted partners could lead to the development of new practices aimed at controlling plant vigor. We are developing a model system to study N regulation by evaluating the responses to N supply among six scion/rootstock (S/R) combinations with known differences in vigor for both partners. The primary objective is to understand the influence of scion and rootstock separately on growth parameters and resource allocation. We measured stem growth during two seasons and biomass, carbon (C) and N allocation patterns in tissues (leaves, stem, trunk and roots) of four plants at the end of the first season. Preliminary results supported the expected vigor behavior of the three `Pinot noir' scions grafted to the same rootstock. This was not true for the four rootstocks grafted to the same scion. High N treatment increases C and N allocation in perennial plant parts. During the second year, N-starvation treatment of the same plants revealed differences in the capacity of rootstocks to remobilize reserves to sustain scion growth. This experiment is the first step in a broad range project that will evaluate the interaction response of scions and rootstocks to N supply.},

	abstract = {Grapevine decline and dieback is a serious problem for grape production in southern Brazil. It is characterized by a set of symptoms that lead to the weakening and death of affected plants. The main causes are a root scale, the ground-pearl (Eurhizococcus brasiliensis), associated with soil fungi (Cylindrocarpon, Fusarium, Phaeacrimonium and others), and high-clay-content soils. Apparently, the root wounds caused by ground-pearl under poorly aerated soil conditions allow the entrance of root decay fungi, resulting in plant death. The creation of grape rootstocks resistant to root decay fungi is one objective of the grape breeding program at Epagri, the Agricultural Research Enterprise of Santa Catarina State, Brazil. The first step was the identification of resistance sources. In rootstock trials carried out in areas where high mortality rates were previously observed, all traditional rootstocks were highly susceptible. Vitis caribaea hybrids showed a high level of resistance but also some defects, such as excessive vigor and absence of winter dormancy. Some genotypes of Vitis shuttleworthii and Vitis palmata, originating from the waterlogged soil conditions of the Everglades (Florida, USA), also showed a high level of resistance. However, the performance of these genotypes and their descendants under dry soil conditions was very poor, and more generations of crossing will be necessary to eliminate undesirable characters. The most promising breeding lines resulted from self pollination of the rootstock IAC 572 (V. caribaea x 101-14Mgt). The selection process started from 840 seedlings and resulted in 23 selections that showed no symptoms of vine decline at three different sites. These selections are being evaluated now for productivity and fruit quality in rootstock trials with different scion cultivars.},

The vineyards of Serra Gaucha, Brazil, are established in soils that may have different physicochemical attributes. Furthermore, the grapevines are grafted on a wide diversity of rootstocks. Therefore, this study aimed to determine their effect on the wine composition of the Cabernet Sauvignon (CS) grafted on RupestrisduLot, 101-14 Mgt, 3309 C, 420A Mgt, 5BB K, 161-49 C, SO4, Solferino, 1103 P, 99 R, 110 R, Gravesac, Fercal, Dogridge and Isabel, featuring some genetic diversity altogether. The experimental design was in randomized blocks, with 15 treatments, three replicates and 10 vines per plot. The grapes were harvested at maturity for three years, and then wines were made in glass recipients of 20 L. When alcoholic and malolactic fermentations were over, the wine analyses were performed on twentyfive variables related to alcohol, acidity, dry extract, polyphenols and volatile compounds. The main results show that all variables were affected year by year, some of them by the rootstock and a few by the interaction between rootstock and year. The rootstock effect was observed mainly on variables related to alcohol, acidity and ashes. Results show that the CS/101-14 Mgt wine had higher alcohol content than CS/Dogridge and CS/Isabel wines, which was probably due to the 101-14 Mgt rootstock favoring an early grape ripening. However, higher pH values were observed in the CS/Rupestrisdu Lot, CS/5BB K and CS/Gravesac than CS/420A Mgt, CS/110 R and CS/Isabel wines. These results show that there is a diversity of rootstocks that can be used by the growers due to the Cabernet Sauvignon wine composition similarities.},

In the present study, we tested whether these and other physiological responses to drought are conferred to a common V. vinifera scion (Cabernet Sauvignon) grafted on V. riparia and V. champinii rootstocks. We measured xylem embolism formation/repair using in vivo microCT imaging, which was accompanied with analysis of leaf gas exchange, osmotic adjustment and root pressure. Our data indicate that differences in scion physiological behaviour for both rootstock combinations were negligible, suggesting that the sensitivity of Cabernet Sauvignon scion to xylem embolism formation/repair, leaf gas exchange and osmotic adjustment is unaffected by either V. riparia or V. champinii rootstock in response to drought stress.},

Cultivation of grapes for fruit and wine began at least 7000 years ago in the Near East, and over the millennia, thousands of cultivars have been developed and selected for particular purposes. Nowadays, grapes are grown all around the world, but mainly in places having a temperate, Mediterranean-style climate, and they are used to produce diverse consumer products including wine, table grapes, raisins, grape juice concentrate and distillate for various industrial uses as well as making fortified wine and brandy. The cultivars of grapes used to make these diverse products are likewise diverse, but a relatively small number account for the vast majority of production in each major category. Predominantly, European V. vinifera scions are grown on rootstock from phylloxera-resistant Native American species. Particular cultivars are valuable to farmers in particular applications for their agronomic traits and fruit-quality traits, which together determine the value of the crop and the cost of producing it. These values can be conditioned by consumer preferences for attributes of the production process and by government policies including trade taxes, alcohol excise taxes, and regulations over production practices or limiting yields. Evolving demands for traits create demands for work by viticulturists and other scientists to understand the grape genome and work with it.},

Information was obtained from 105 viticulture regions, representing approx. four million ha of vineyards. Vintage and table wines are the main industry products, followed by nursery plants and table grapes. Diverse scion cultivars are grown, with 13 cultivars providing 50\% of survey respondent production, and Riesling Italico, Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot predominating.

Despite the diversity of grapevine training, Guyot and cordon remain the most widespread methods, and grapevines are mainly hand-pruned. The use of pneumatic shears and mechanical pruning is becoming more common in some countries. The survey questionnaire proposed a simplified set of symptoms or diseases occurring in mature vineyards [apoplexy, esca complex leaf symptoms (including Grapevine Leaf Stripe Disease, GLSD), dead cordon, Eutypa related dieback, Botryosphaeria or unidentified agent dieback, Phomopsis cane and leaf spot]. Apoplexy and esca/GLSD, defining the esca complex, were the most frequent and increasing syndromes in almost all countries, except Israel and the United Kingdom, where these diseases are not present or not recorded in the survey. Dead cordon and Phomopsis cane and leaf spot were mentioned as occurring in a large number of regions but not frequently. Within individual countries, the profile of GTDs varied according to the region, and to pedo-climatic and production conditions. GTDs on young vines were uncommon, but remain a subject of concern in some of European countries with large nursery production. This overview on spread and relevance of GTDs in Europe and related aspects will be a useful starting point for policy makers and for collaborative research on factors contributing to the increasing disease incidence of GTDs.},

Nitrogen can be taken up in various forms, such as nitrate, ammonium or amino acids or even small peptides, and is of considerable importance in vigor control and in yield and berry quality. Amino acids in the must adjust fermentation kinetics, constitute a major source for yeast and affect vine metabolism. In the present study, two different experiments were undertaken; nitrate, ammonium, urea, arginine and glutamine at various doses (0; 0.5; 1.0; 3.0 g N/plant) were used to fertilize (i) two hydroponically grown rootstock varieties (Ru140 and SO4) and (ii) grafted grapevines of Vitis vinifera L cv. Regent (rootstock SO4) grown in pots. Accumulation capabilities, generative growth and berry quality were examined. It can be assed that the preferred N form is rootstockvariety-dependent. We demonstrated that grapevines were able to take up nitrogen in the form of amino acids; (arginine to a greater extent than glutamine). Although, growth was reduced, nitrogen content and nitrate reductase activity were comparable for nitrate, ammonium and urea nutrition. In terms of berry quality, only minor differences between the N forms applied were identified. An economic optimum in terms of vine and berry quality was detected. Excessive amounts of nitrogen seemed to lead to the increased growth of green plant tissue. Berry yield increased with increasing nitrogen supply but slightly decreased at the highest dosage, whereas quality parameters such as must pH increased and the total acid concentration was reduced.},

The main results show that, at grape maturity, the PCA discriminated mainly the juices of CS/101-14 Mgt, CS/SO4 and CS/Gravesac, which had high density, total soluble solids, total soluble solids/titratable acidity ratio and pH, and CS/Dogridge and CS/Fercal, which had high titratable acidity. The density, total soluble solids, titratable acidity, total soluble solids/titratable acidity ratio increased as grape ripened, but the titratable acidity decreased. However, the increase or decrease rates were lower at the end of the grape ripening cycle according to the variable, and the total soluble solids having the highest increase (116.3\%) and the titratable acidity the highest decrease (68.3\%).},

Each site was planted with identical sets of 14 rootstocks. Leaf petioles were sampled at the three phenological stages of bloom, veraison, and harvest and analyzed for potassium (K) content. Rootstocks differed significantly in petiole K concentration at bloom, 44-53 had the highest K status at all three phenological sampling times, and Freedom also had high K status. Total K levels generally declined significantly between bloom and harvest for all varieties, although the amount and pattern of decline differed among rootstocks. Leaf lamina K concentrations were much lower than those of petioles. The ranges between the high and low values were much narrower, but trends were consistent with petiole samples. Rootstocks with Vitis berlandieri genetic backgrounds contained lower levels of petiole K at bloom, but these differences were not apparent at veraison and harvest. It is possible that water deprivation because of drip-irrigation or deficit-irrigation practices contributed to this result, as it has not been consistently observed in previous investigations.},

	abstract = {Selection of a suitable rootstock lays the foundation for meeting vineyard, grape and wine objectives. Tolerance to biotic and abiotic conditions is a determining factor. Despite the significance of the grapevine root system in vegetative and reproductive growth as well as grape and wine composition and quality, root behaviour under an array of very complex and integrated environmental impacting factors is largely unknown and research in this regard is surprisingly limited. In this paper, a compilation of some of the research done over many years on root system behaviour is presented. Various aspects of the interaction between the root system and the complex natural environment in which it grows as well as commonly known viticulture practices are discussed. Results obtained under controlled and field conditions are shown. Physical and chemical properties and pre-establishment preparation of the soil have defining effects on metabolic behaviour and spatial distribution (horizontally and vertically) of roots. Alleviation of soil impediments to root penetration provides the best possible basis for above-ground growth. The health status of plant material, genetic characteristics and grafting and nursery processes have a steering impact on the ability of the root system to perform within biotic and abiotic constraints of the soil environment to such an extent that expectations in terms of growth, yield and grape quality of the scion are met. Agronomic practices exert a further tailoring impact on root system performance and support to aboveground growth. The study of only above-ground factors is clearly not sufficient to explain vineyard behaviour. Intensified inter-disciplinary research efforts are required in our quest to understand scion-root system inter-relationships and to control scion behaviour in order to facilitate greater sustainability in grape and wine production.},

In this study, we show that two grapevine rootstock genotypes have different shoot branching architectures when cultivated as cuttings and that this trait is transmitted to the scion when grafted. Shoot branching plasticity in response to nitrogen supply was also studied. As strigolactones are known to have a role in the regulation of shoot development in response to nutrient availability, their involvement in the control of scion architecture by the rootstock was investigated. Functional characterization of putative grapevine strigolactone biosynthetic genes in Arabidopsis mutants or grapevine cell suspensions showed similar functions to those of Arabidopsis. Both rootstocks produced strigolactone-like compounds; the quantity produced in response to nitrogen treatments differed between the two rootstock genotypes and correlated with the expression of putative strigolactone biosynthetic genes. Exudation of strigolactone-like compounds by both rootstocks was closely related to the developmental pattern of the scion in grafted plants. These results suggest that differential regulation of strigolactone biosynthesis in response to nitrogen availability may contribute to the control of scion development conferred by each rootstock genotype.},

Little is known about the disease cycle of this fungus. Infected propagation material was identiﬁed as a major means of dissemination of the pathogen. Recently, the pathogen was also detected from soil in South Africa and airborne conidia have been found in vineyards. The aim of this study was to use a molecular detection technique to test diﬀerent samples collected from nurseries in South Africa at diﬀerent nursery stages for the presence of P. chlamydospora. A one-tube nested-PCR technique was optimised for detecting P. chlamydospora in DNA extracted from soil, water, callusing medium and grapevine wood. The one-tube nested-PCR was sensitive enough to detect as little as 1 fg of P. chlamydospora genomic DNA from water and 10 fg from wood, callusing medium and soil. PCR analyses of the diﬀerent nursery samples revealed the presence of several putative 360 bp P. chlamydospora speciﬁc bands. Subsequent sequence analyses and/ or restriction enzyme digestions of all 360 bp PCR bands conﬁrmed that all bands were P. chlamydospora speciﬁc, except for ﬁve bands obtained from callusing media and one from water. Phaeomoniella chlamydospora was positively detected in 25\% of rootstock cane sections collected from mother blocks, 42\% of rootstock cuttings and 16\% of scion cuttings collected during grafting, 40\% of water samples collected after pre-storage hydration, 67\% of water samples collected during grafting, 8\% of callusing medium samples and 17\% of soil samples collected from mother blocks. These media can therefore be considered as possible inoculum sources of the pathogen during the nursery stages.},

Nevertheless, the mechanisms of rootstocks’ tolerance to drought are not yet fully understood. The aims of this study were to evaluate the adaptation of Vitis sp. leaf stomata (density and size) to soil water deficit via interaction with different rootstocks known for their drought tolerance characteristics. Greenhouse trials were carried out in controlled ambient conditions. ‘Pinotage’ (Vitis vinifera L.) grafted onto two rootstocks (99Richter and 110Richter) were used. Half of the grapevines were subjected to severe water constraints. The other half were maintained well-watered. The results confirmed that one mechanism of ‘Pinotage’ leaf adaptation to water constraints was structural during leaf growth, with a reduction in pore size to reduce plant water loss. The transpiration rate of leaves was more related to stomatal size than density. Future studies with rootstocks with contrasting vigour inducing capacity and drought tolerance are needed in order to address the rootstock effect on leaf water status related to changes in leaf growth.},

	abstract = {In viticulture, rootstocks are essential to cope with edaphic constraints. They can also be used to modulate scion growth and development to help improve berry yield and quality. The rootstock contribution to scion growth is not fully understood. Since nitrogen (N) is a signiﬁcant driver of grapevine growth, rootstock properties associated with N uptake and transport may play a key role in the growth potential of grafted grapevines. We evaluated N uptake and transport in a potted system using two grapevines rootstocks [Riparia Gloire (RG) and 1103 Paulsen (1103P)] grafted to Pinot noir (Pommard clone) scion. Combining results of nitrate induction and steady-state experiments at two N availability levels, we observed different responses in the uptake and utilization of N between the two rootstocks. The low vigor rootstock (RG) exhibited greater nitrate uptake capacity and nitrate assimilation in roots after nitrate resupply than the more vigorous 1103P rootstock. This behavior may be attributed to a greater root carbohydrate status observed in RG for both experiments. However, 1103P demonstrated a higher N translocation rate to shoots regardless of N availability. These distinct rootstock behaviors resulted in signiﬁcant differences in biomass allocation between roots and shoots under N-limited conditions, although the overall vine biomass was not different. Under sufﬁcient N supply, differences between rootstocks decreased but 1103P stored more N in roots, which may beneﬁt growth in subsequent growing seasons. Overall, greater transpiration of vines grafted to 1103P rootstock causing higher N translocation to shoots could partially explain its known growth-promoting effect to scions under low and high N availability, whereas the low vigor typically conferred to scions by RG may result from the combination of lower N translocation to shoots and a greater allocation of biomass toward roots when N is low.},

The experimental design was in randomized blocks, with 15 treatments, three replicates, 10 vines per plot. Mature grapes were harvested, and wines were made in 20-L glass recipients. When alcoholic and malolactic fermentations were finished, the wines were bottled and stored at 18°C. Sensory analysis was performed in the next year, following international procedures. The tasting panel was formed by 12 experienced enologists, who evaluated the wines in individual cells separated by opaque glass. They were served monadically and the perception of each taster was recorded in 9-cm unstructured scale sheets. Twenty-two variables were evaluated, which were related to the visual, olfactory and taste aspects. The results show that the tasting panel was not able to detect significant differences (p{\textgreater} 0.05) of rootstocks in any variable related to the sensory characteristics of Cabernet Sauvignon wine.},

	abstract = {In response to increasing concerns over climate change, soil health and wine quality, grape growers are seeking new practices (e.g., biochar application) to minimize their environmental footprint while increasing productivity and the quality of their products. To explore the potential of biochar-based amendments to achieve these goals in wine grape production, vineyard trials were established in the fall of 2018. Two Oregon sites were chosen with distinct soil types and climates (Willamette Valley and Rogue Valley) but planted with the same grapevine scion/rootstock Pinot noir combination. Four treatments were applied under vines at each location: no biochar-no tillage (NT); no biochar + tillage (B0); 18 tons ­ha−1 biochar + tillage (B18); 35 tons ­ha−1 biochar + tillage (B35). In 2019, a suite of soil health, plant, and crop variables were measured, and wines were produced after harvest. The incorporation of biochar modified the chemical and physical composition of soils at the two studied locations, increasing the bioavailability of carbon and nitrogen, their gravimetric water content and the concentration of plant available micro and macro nutrients. No responses of plant physiology parameters or productivity at either site were found after biochar incorporation when compared with controls. Conversely, a significant and gradual decrease in the amount of wine tannins was found as a result of biochar application in wines produced from grapes from the Woodhall location. Long-term field experiments are required to assess the effects of biochar on soil properties, vine physiology, productivity, and grape and wine quality several years after incorporation.},

	abstract = {Diminishing availability of non‐saline water in arid and semiarid regions is of concern to all irrigated agricultural producers, including wine and grape producers. Grapes are not a salt tolerant crop and producers often face the choice of either limiting fresh water application, using alternative saline waters or a combination of both. We examined the salt tolerance and effect of restricted water application on three purported salt tolerant rootstocks grafted to Cabernet Sauvignon scion in a 4‐year replicated field experiment. ANOVA indicated significant effects of salinity water stress and rootstock on fruit yields. The 140 Ruggeri scion was the top producer across all treatments including control, followed by Salt Creek, with St. George significantly less productive than 140 Ruggeri across all treatments. In terms of salt tolerance, Salt Creek and 140 Ruggeri were not statistically different but St. George was significantly less tolerant than Salt Creek. In terms of drought tolerance (relative yield), there were no statistical differences among rootstocks. Soil salinity profiles and soil moisture sensors indicated reduced water consumption under high salinity, thus no matric stress under 60\% of optimal water application when high salt stress was present. The multiplicative stress model where salt and water stress are individually evaluated did not satisfactorily predict yield under combined salinity and reduced water application, likely due to decreased water consumption under saline conditions. Short term (one year) experiments underestimate salt damage to grape vines as salt tolerance decreased over the 4‐year experiment.},

	abstract = {The trans-resveratrol content of Vitis vinifera L. cv. 'Cabernet Sauvignon' and cv. 'Italian Riesling' grafted on five rootstocks was analysed from matured cane and root during 3 years in field conditions. In the past decade resveratrol, one of the stilbene molecules of grape, has been intensively studied and has shown its various promising bioactivities. Resveratrol has been detected in several grape organs, but the highest concentrations occur in cane and in root. Grafts used in viticulture have genetically different root and shoot systems. HPLC-DAD method was used to determine the trans-resveratrol content of the ethanolic extracts of grape canes and roots. Trans-resveratrol contents of the roots ranged from 9.3 to 219.1 mg/kg fresh weight and of the canes from 6.7 to 207.9 mg/kg fresh weight. The concentration of trans-resveratrol was affected mainly by the year in both cases of the scion varieties and we observed significant differences between scion-rootstock combinations (p{\textless}0.05) under the same cropping conditions. Consequently, it was found that grape canes and roots vary considerably with respect to trans-resveratrol contents depending on the year. The rootstocks have effect on the trans-resveratrol content within the years in the case of 'Italian Riesling' and 'Cabernet Sauvignon'.},

	abstract = {Water deficits are known to alter fine root structure and function, but little is known about how these responses contribute to differences in drought resistance across grapevine rootstocks. The ways in which water deficit affects root anatomical and physiological characteristics were studied in two grapevine rootstocks considered as low–medium (101-14Mgt) and highly (110R) drought resistant. Rootstocks were grown under prolonged and repeated drying cycles or frequent watering (‘dry’ and ‘wet’ treatments, respectively), and the following parameters were evaluated: root osmotic and hydrostatic hydraulic conductivity (Lpos and Lphyd, respectively), suberization, steady-state root pressure (Prs), sap exudation rates, sap osmotic potential, and exosmotic relaxation curves. For both rootstocks, the ‘dry’ treatment reduced fine root Lp, elicited earlier root suberization and higher sap osmotic potential, and generated greater Prs after rewatering, but the rootstocks responded differently under these conditions. Lpos, Lphyd, and sap exudation rates were significantly higher in 110R than in 101-14Mgt, regardless of moisture treatment. Under ‘dry’ conditions, 110R maintained a similar Lpos and decreased the Lphyd by 36\% compared with ‘wet’ conditions, while both parameters were decreased by at least 50\% for 101-14Mgt under ‘dry’ conditions. Interestingly, build-up of Prs in 110R was 34\% lower on average than in 101-14Mgt, suggesting differences in the development of suberized apoplastic barriers between the rootstocks as visualized by analysis of suberization from fluorescence microscopy. Consistent with this pattern, 110R exhibited the greatest exosmotic Lpos (i.e. Lpos of water flowing from roots to the soil) as determined from relaxation curves under wet conditions, where backflow may have limited its capacity to generate positive xylem pressure. The traits studied here can be used in combination to provide new insights needed for screening drought resistance across grapevine rootstocks.},

Methods and Results: Field performance and grape composition of low-vigour cultivars (Chasselas, Egiodola, Ehrenfelser, Gamay, Perdea, Reichensteiner and Roussanne) grown as own roots or grafted on rootstocks (1103 Paulsen, Dog Ridge, Ramsey, Schwarzmann and SO4) were assessed over three seasons. Across all cultivars, yield of own roots, SO4 and Schwarzmann was similar. Ramsey and 1103 Paulsen produced a higher yield without a major effect on juice composition. Dog Ridge produced excessive vigour and poor grape composition. Across the scion–rootstock combinations, high vine vigour, yield and berry mass were associated with high juice pH, K+ and malic acid and low tartaric acid. Rootstock effects on juice K+, tartaric and malic acid were stable and independent of the scion cultivar.
Conclusions: The performance of low-vigour cultivars was enhanced by grafting on 1103 Paulsen and Ramsey. ‘Scion conferred root vigour’ was found under ﬁeld conditions. Signiﬁcance of the Study: The genetic diversity of cultivars available for wine production can be broadened by adoption of rootstocks for low-vigour cultivars. Rootstock selection requires knowledge of inherent scion vigour and conferred rootstock vigour.},

The influence of scion-rootstock combination on the studied variables was dependent on the time of harvest. The peel color of ‘Ruby Red’ grafted on ‘Swingle’ citrumelo is more vivid and redder when harvested in October than when harvested in August. ‘Ruby Red’ and ‘Star Ruby’ grapefruit harvested in October are sweeter, less acidic, juicier, and richer in ascorbic acid than those harvested in August. ‘Cleopatra’ mandarin rootstock might favor ascorbic acid levels at harvest, but the fruit may lose more weight during storage.},

	abstract = {Reliable assessment of grapevine productivity is a destructive and time-consuming process. In addition, the mixed effects of grapevine water status and scion-rootstock interactions on grapevine productivity are not always linear. Despite the potential opportunity of applying remote sensing and machine learning techniques to predict plant traits, there are still limitations to previously studied techniques for vine productivity due to the complexity of the system not being adequately modeled. During the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons, hyperspectral reﬂectance spectra were collected using a handheld spectroradiometer in a vineyard designed to investigate the effects of irrigation level (0\%, 50\%, and 100\%) and rootstocks (1103 Paulsen, 3309 Couderc, SO4 and Chambourcin) on vine productivity. To assess vine productivity, it is necessary to measure factors related to fruit ripeness and not just yield, as an over cropped vine may produce high-yield but poor-quality fruit. Therefore, yield, Total Soluble Solids (TSS), Titratable Acidity (TA) and the ratio TSS/TA (maturation index, IMAD) were measured. A total of 20 vegetation indices were calculated from hyperspectral data and used as input for predictive model calibration. Prediction performance of linear/nonlinear multiple regression methods and Weighted Regularized Extreme Learning Machine (WRELM) were compared with our newly developed WRELM-TanhRe. The developed method is based on two activation functions: hyperbolic tangent (Tanh) and rectiﬁed linear unit (ReLU). The results revealed that WRELM and WRELM-TanhRe outperformed the widely used multiple regression methods when model performance was tested with an independent validation dataset. WRELM-TanhRe produced the highest prediction accuracy for all the berry yield and quality parameters (R2 of 0.522–0.682 and RMSE of 2–15\%), except for TA, which was predicted best with WRELM (R2 of 0.545 and RMSE of 6\%). The results demonstrate the value of combining hyperspectral remote sensing and machine learning methods for improving of berry yield and quality prediction.},

	abstract = {Two ﬁeld experiments with ‘Valencia’ sweet orange [Citrus sinensis (L.) Osb.] trees propagated on 12 rootstocks were conducted in commercial orchards. The objectives were to compare rootstock horticultural performance between two locations with soils representative of the Central Florida Ridge (AP) and coastal ﬂatwoods (I), the major citrus-growing regions in Florida, and to see if ﬁnancial analysis would provide an improved basis for interpreting rootstock performance. The randomized complete-block trials involved six-tree plots replicated eight or 10 times at planting densities of 358 trees (AP) or 252 trees (I)/ha, respectively. Tree growth and survival, yield, and juice quality were measured for 15 years. When losses occurred, trees were replaced annually with another one on the same rootstock. The data of seven rootstocks were subjected to a ﬁnancial interpretation of three scenarios: tree loss and tree loss with or without tree replacement using the discounted cash ﬂow and internal rate of return methods at a 15\% rate. At the ﬂatwoods location, when differences among replications became apparent on several rootstocks, soil data were collected to study its possible association to tree performance; also in this trial, 400-kg fruit samples were differentially harvested in 2 successive years from mature trees on each of ﬁve commercial rootstocks when the juice soluble solids/acid ratio was near 15. The juice was extracted, pasteurized, and evaluated for ﬂavor by an experienced taste panel. The horticultural data obtained for trees on speciﬁc well-studied rootstocks [Volkamer (C. volkameriana Ten. \& Pasq.)] and rough (C. jambhiri Lush.) lemons, Carrizo citrange [C. sinensis · Poncirus trifoliata (L.)], sour orange [C. aurantium (L.)], Cleopatra mandarin (C. reshni Hort. ex Tan.), trifoliate orange (P. trifoliata), a selection of sweet orange (C. sinensis), and Swingle citrumelo (C. paradisi Macf. · P. trifoliata) at both locations were typical of their well-documented performance in Florida and elsewhere. Tree losses were virtually only from citrus blight and ranged from none (sour orange) to greater than 50\% (Volkamer and rough lemons) at both locations, although tree loss began later at the Central Florida location. ‘Valencia’ cuttings (only at the ﬂatwoods site) were long-lived and cropped well for their smaller size compared with the budded trees. Taste panelists were not able to distinguish differences over two seasons among pasteurized ‘Valencia’ juices produced from trees on different rootstocks and normalized by soluble solids/acid ratio. Yield and planting density were the main factors affecting ﬁnancial outcome; also, in the highly variable soils of the coastal ﬂatwoods, trees growing in sites with greater depth to an argillic layer had 30\% to 200\% higher yields. Trees on Volkamer lemon had only ’50\% survival at both locations but had the highest (\$7,338/ha I) or one of the highest cash ﬂows (\$13,464/ha AP) as compared with one of the commercial standards, Carrizo citrange (\$6,928 I; \$16,826 AP), which had only ’25\% tree loss. Inclusion of ﬁnancial analysis, with certain limitations, was concluded to considerably improve rootstock selection decisions compared with selection based only on horticultural data.},

	abstract = {This paper describes variation in transpiration efﬁciency ‘W’ (where W = dry matter produced/water transpired) among grapevine genotypes grown under well-watered conditions in either a glasshouse or a vineyard. Nineteen genotypes were grown in a glasshouse where growth and transpiration were measured. W ranged from 2.5 to 3.4 g dm/kg H2O transpired. Carbon-isotope discrimination (∆) of laminae dry matter ranged from 20.8 to 22.7‰ and there was a negative relationship (R2 = 0.58) between W and ∆. A large proportion of variation in W could be attributed to variation in stomatal conductance. Genotypic variation in photosynthetic capacity was also an important component of variation in W. In a second experiment, lamina ∆ was measured for mature ﬁeld-grown Shiraz and Chardonnay, grown either on their own roots or grafted to ﬁve different rootstocks, and maintained at three sites under wellwatered conditions. At all sites and regardless of rootstock, the laminae of Chardonnay had ∆ values 1 to 2‰ lower than Shiraz. There was also a 1 to 2‰ variation among the sites. Rootstock variety affected ∆ values inconsistently and by a maximum of 0.5‰. Leaf gas exchange measurements were performed at a single site on sun-exposed leaves of Chardonnay and Shiraz on either their own roots or 1103 Paulsen, a moderate to high vigour rootstock. There was no signiﬁcant effect of rootstock on leaf gas exchange and photosynthetic rates did not differ between scion varieties. However, Chardonnay had a 20\% lower stomatal conductance and a 1.4-fold higher ratio of CO2 assimilation/H2O transpiration (A/T) indicating a potentially higher W, at a leaf level, for Chardonnay compared with Shiraz. We conclude that photosynthetic capacity was also higher for Chardonnay. ∆ values, predicted from the Ci/Ca ratio calculated from leaf gas exchange measurements, did not differ signiﬁcantly from measured values for laminae ∆. This similarity for ∆, in conjunction with the fact that the lower ∆ of Chardonnay was reﬂected in a higher A/T ratio, suggests that ∆ may be a reliable predictor of comparative W under vineyard conditions.},

	abstract = {Grapevines are grown either on their own roots or on rootstocks that represent a mixture of grapevine species and hybrids. Developmental and physiological factors other than phylloxera resistance, lime tolerance, and ease of propagation were not directly considered during rootstock breeding, including rooting patterns. Here, in a comprehensive literature synthesis, we have compiled information concerning rooting depth distributions of grapevine roots from wall profile studies comprising a broad range of soil environments and rootstock genotypes. We considered the distributions based on the asymptotic equation of Y = (1 - ßd), where d = soil depth (cm) and Y = the proportion of roots from the surface to depth d. The median value of ß for the root distributions analyzed was 0.9826 and the standard deviation over all observations was 0.0068 (n = 240); most profiles had fitted values of ß generally greater than 0.975. This value places the depth distribution of grapevine roots in the vadose zone among the deepest observed for plants worldwide. The data suggested that soil properties such as the presence of soil profiles impermeable to root penetration, stoniness, and presence of gravel lenses have a greater influence on depth distributions than does genotype, even in deep fertile soils. Genotypic differences were not apparent, although the rootstock O3916 (ß = 0.9867 ± 0.0009, mean ± se, n = 11), with a reputation for deep-rooting behavior, did exhibit deeper root distributions. The analysis also suggests that root characteristics other than root horizontal and vertical spread may need to be considered in order to explain some key rootstock characteristics like scion vigor or drought tolerance.},

In addition, we compared the growth, fruit quality, and yield efficiency of ‘Fuyu’ scions grafted onto three candidate dwarfing rootstocks (‘Hour­ akudai’, No. 3, and S22 clones) with those of ‘Aogaki’ seedlings grown under conventional cultivation (pruned and fruited). In unpruned and non-bearing trees, grafts on S22 and ‘Hourakudai’ rootstocks reached about 75 \% of the height of trees on the standard rootstock. Tree canopy volumes on the S22 and ‘Hourakudai’ rootstocks were about 67 \% and 42 \%, respectively, of those on the standard rootstock. The high positive correlation be­ tween TCSA and tree canopy volume was observed for not only between trees grown under unpruned and nonbearing but also trees grown under pruned and bearing. Tree canopy volume was a better indicator of dwarfing capacity of rootstocks than tree height or tree canopy area. In conventional cultivation, trees grafted on all three candidate dwarfing rootstocks had smaller canopy area and canopy volume than those grafted onto the standard rootstock, from 2 to 11 years after planting. Although differences in tree growth between the three dwarf rootstocks were observed, the differences tended to decrease as tree age advanced. The quality of fruit produced (fruit weight, soluble solids content, and skin color) by trees on dwarf rootstocks did not differ from that pro­ duced on standard rootstocks, although annual variations occurred. Trees on S22 rootstock had the lowest yield owing to decreased vigor. Trees on ‘Hourakudai’ rootstock had the highest yield efficiency per trunk crosssectional area of scions and per tree canopy volume. ‘Hourakudai’ softwood cuttings showed the highest root­ ing rate (80 \%). These results identify ‘Hourakudai’ as a promising new rootstock for growing dwarfed ‘Fuyu’ trees, owing to the high yield efficiency without a decrease in fruit quality.},

In the last decade, these areas have experienced a dramatic reduction in rainfall, which has resulted in water shortage for sweet cherry. The use of specific root-stock and scion combinations could help improve the tolerance of plants to water shortage events. This study reports on the influence of rootstocks on whole-plant performance under water deficit as detected by hydraulic sensitivity, root hydraulic conductivity (Lp), water use efficiency and sugar content. Four Prunus rootstocks/scion combinations -'Bing/Colt', `Lapins/Colt', `Bing/Mx60', `Lapins/Mx60', and two self-rooted rootstocks Colt and Maxma 60 -were acclimated for 30 days and then exposed to well-watered (WW) and water deficit (WD) conditions for 36 days. Whole-plant transpiration and growth were both influenced by WD, and two groups were identified based on responses: `Bing/Colt', `Bing/Mx60' and `Mx60' had an early reduction (conservative strategy), whereas `Lapins/Mx60', `Lapins/Colt' and `Colt' had late reduction (productive strategy) in transpi-ration as WD increased. Among the combinations, `Lapins/Colt' and `Colt' showed a remarkable growth response to the WD being less affected in shoot and root biomass. The `Colt' rootstock maintained a higher psi gs50 (near-isohydric behavior) than combinations using the `Mx60' rootstock (near anisohydric behavior). The relationship between Lp and the variation of psi pre-dawn-psi midday showed differences among rootstock/scion combinations, and under WD condition the reduction in Lp induced by WD affected the whole-plant WUE of combinations differ-ently. Sucrose and sorbitol content in leaves and roots of WD-tolerant combinations such as `Colt' and `Lapins/ Colt', showed a remarkable increase under WD condition. Our finding highlights the importance of the specific interaction between rootstock and scion, suggesting that combinations characterized by a higher water uptake capacity under conditions of lower water availability would be sustainable under minimal to moderate water deficit.},

Thus, the response of vines to drought is the result of the interaction between the scion variety and the rootstock genotype. In this work, the responses of genotypes to drought were evaluated on 1103P and 101-14MGt plants, own-rooted and grafted with Cabernet Sauvignon, in three different water deficit conditions (80, 50, and 20\% soil water content, SWC). Gas exchange parameters, stem water potential, root and leaf ABA content, and root and leaf transcriptomic response were investigated. Under well-watered conditions, gas exchange and stem water potential were mainly affected by the grafting condition, whereas under sever water deficit they were affected by the rootstock genotype. Under severe stress conditions (20\% SWC), 1103P showed an “avoidance” behavior. It reduced stomatal conductance, inhibited photosynthesis, increased ABA content in the roots, and closed the stomata. The 101-14MGt maintained a high photosynthetic rate, limiting the reduction of soil water potential. This behavior results in a “tolerance” strategy. An analysis of the transcriptome showed that most of the differentially expressed genes were detected at 20\% SWC, and more significantly in roots than in leaves. A core set of genes has been highlighted on the roots as being related to the root response to drought that are not affected by genotype nor grafting. Genes specifically regulated by grafting and genes specifically regulated by genotype under drought conditions have been identified as well. The 1103P, more than the 101-14MGt, regulated a high number of genes in both own-rooted and grafted conditions. This different regulation revealed that 1103P rootstock readily perceived the water scarcity and rapidly faced the stress, in agreement with its avoidance strategy.},

The rootstock genotypes' effect on the scion physiological response, aquaporin expression, and hormone concentrations in the xylem and the leaf was assessed under well watered (WW) and water stress (WS) conditions. Under WW, vines grafted onto 1103P and R110 rootstocks (the more vigorous and drought-tolerant) showed higher photosynthesis (A(N)), stomatal conductance (g(s)), and hydraulic conductance (Kh(plant)) compared with the less vigorous and drought-sensitive rootstock (161-49C), while under WS, there were hardly any differences between vines depending on the rootstock grafted. Besides, stomatal traits were affected by drought, which was related to g(s), but not by the rootstock. Under WS conditions, all VvPIP and VvTIP aquaporins were up-regulated in the vines grafted onto 1103P and down-regulated in the ones grafted onto 161-49C. The 1103P capability to tolerate drought was enhanced by the up-regulation of all VvPIP and VvTIP aquaporins, lower ABA synthesis, and higher ACC/ABA ratios in leaves during WS compared with 161-49C. It was concluded that, under WW conditions, transpiration and stomatal control were rootstock-dependent. However, under WS conditions, alterations in the molecular components of water transport and hormone concentration of the scion resulted in similar gas exchange values in the studied scions grafted onto different rootstocks.},

The results suggested that the cuttings of most rootstocks had callus-forming indices (CFIs) over 0.5 except for `188-08' (0.28). The rooting rate of `420A' was 5\%, while that of the rest of the rootstocks was greater than 48\%. The internode lengths of the one-year-old vines were positively correlated with those (as well as cane lengths and pruning weights) of the adult vines. These rootstocks were grouped into three clusters based on the growth measurements across three seasons. Eight combinations of genetic backgrounds showed various effects on the growth indicators. The high-vigor cluster includes `1103P', `5BB', `225Ru', etc.; the medium-vigor cluster includes `Dogridge', `101-14M', `Fercal', etc.; and the low-vigor cluster includes `Gloire', `3309C', `Ganzin1', etc. The Vitis berlandieri parentage showed a higher vigor heredity, while the V. riparia showed a lower vigor heredity.

	abstract = {Litchi is an important commercial fruit crop widely grown in the world. Graft incompatibility between rootstocks and scions is a major constraint for large-scale cultivation of litchi orchards, popularization of new and excellent litchi varieties, and associated industrial development. Further, the genetic mechanism of graft incompatibility is still unclear in litchi. To reduce the incompatibility problems, this study investigated metabolic and transcriptomic differences between graft compatible and incompatible rootstock-scion combinations of litchi. The result of metabolomics analysis showed that incompatible rootstock-scion interaction modified the profiles of several metabolic substances. However, various compounds of flavonoids, phenolic acids, and lignin predominantly exhibited significantly altered abundance in graft incompatible combinations. Transcriptome analysis identified that graft incompatibility induces dynamic gene differences. The majority of these differentially expressed genes were enriched in biosynthetic pathways of phenylpropanoids. The differential expressions of genes in these pathways could be linked to the differential abundance levels of flavonoids, phenolic acids, and lignin compounds. Integrated metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed a strong relationship between differential genes and differential metabolites identified in this study. In addition, identified hub genes and metabolites were closely associated with graft incompatibility of litchi. This study characterized the abundance of metabolites and genes in graft incompatible combinations and further discussed the genetic mechanism of graft incompatibility in litchi. Our results provide a platform to dissect the molecular mechanisms of graft incompatibility in the litchi fruit.},

Viticultural traits measuring vegetative growth, yield, berry quality, and nutrient uptake were collected at the beginning (1995 to 1999) and end (2017 to 2020) of the lifetime of a vineyard initially planted in 1991 and removed in 2021. X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) was used to measure ring widths in 103 vines. Ring width was modeled as a function of ring number using a negative exponential model. Early and late wood ring widths, cambium width, and scion trunk radius were correlated with 27 traits. Modeling of annual ring width shows that scions alter the width of the first rings but that rootstocks alter the decay of later rings, consistently shortening ring width throughout the lifetime of the vine. Ravaz index, juice pH, photosynthetic assimilation and transpiration rates, and instantaneous water use efficiency are correlated with scion trunk radius. Ultimately, our research indicates that rootstocks modulate secondary growth over years, altering physiology and agronomic traits. Rootstocks act in similar but distinct ways from climate to modulate ring width, which borrowing techniques from dendrochronology, can be used to monitor both genetic and environmental effects in woody perennial crop species.},

Objectives of this experiment were to compare the growth and fruitfulness of shoots grown from primary and secondary buds of V. vinifera `Grenache' vines grafted onto three rootstocks (110 R, 1103P, and Freedom). Over two growing seasons, field-grown vines were exposed to the following treatments: primary bud growth and forced secondary bud growth (simulated late spring frost). Leaf gas exchange, pruning cane weight, vine yield, and fruit maturity data were collected each year. Bud treatment or rootstock did not influence leaf gas exchange. Cane weight and yield data were greater for shoots grown from primary bud shoots, and rootstock 1103P. In addition, berries grown from primary buds and 1103P rootstocks were more mature compared to fruits from secondary buds or vines grown on other rootstocks.

Toward this end, we grafted two determinate-type scions [grape tomato ('BHN 1022') and beefsteak tomato ('Skyway')] onto four rootstocks with different characteristics to examine plant growth, yield performance, biomass production, and fruit mineral nutrient composition. The study was conducted during two growing seasons (spring and fall plantings in Florida) under organic production in high tunnels with the non-grafted scions as controls. Rootstocks had previously been designated as either “generative” ('Estamino') or “vegetative” ('DR0141TX') by some commercial suppliers or had not been characterized ['RST-04-106-T' and `SHIELD RZ F1 (61-802)']. Also, `Estamino', `DR0141TX', and `RST-04-106-T' had been described as more vigorous than `SHIELD RZ F1 (61-802)'. In both planting seasons (with low levels of soilborne disease pressure), the “vegetative” and “generative” rootstocks increased marketable and total fruit yields for both scions except for the beefsteak tomato grafted with the “vegetative” rootstock in fall planting. Positive effects of `RST-04-106-T' on fruit yield varied with scions and planting seasons, and were most manifested when grafted with the beefsteak tomato scion in fall planting. `SHIELD RZ F1 (61-802)' led to similar yields as the non-grafted controls except for grafting with the grape tomato scion in fall planting. For vegetative and fruit biomass, both the “vegetative” and “generative” rootstocks had positive impacts except for the beefsteak tomato in fall planting. For fruit mineral composition, the “vegetative” and “generative” rootstocks, both highly vigorous, consistently elevated fruit P, K, Ca, Zn, and Fe contents on a dry weight basis, whereas the other rootstocks did not. Overall, although the more vigorous rootstocks enhanced tomato plant productivity and fruit minerals, the evidence presented here does not support the suggestion that the so-called “vegetative” and “generative” rootstocks have different impacts on tomato scion yield, biomass production, or fruit mineral contents. More studies with different production systems and environmental conditions as well as contrasting scion genotypes are needed to further categorize the impacts of rootstocks with different vigor and other characteristics on plant biomass production and their implications on fruit yield development.},

	abstract = {Previous studies of tomato rootstock effects on fruit quality have yielded mixed results, and few attempts have been made to systematically examine the association between rootstock characteristics and tomato fruit quality. In this study, grape tomato ('BHN 1022') and beefsteak tomato ('Skyway') were grafted onto four rootstocks ['Estamino' (vigorous and “generative”), `DR0141TX' (vigorous and “vegetative”), `RST-04-106-T' (uncharacterized), and `SHIELD RZ F1 (61-802)' (mid-vigor, uncharacterized)] and compared to non-grafted scion controls for two growing seasons (Spring and Fall in Florida) in organically managed high tunnels. In both seasons and for both scions, the two vigorous rootstocks, regardless of their designation as “vegetative” ('DR0141TX') or “generative” ('Estamino'), exhibited negative impacts on dry matter content, soluble solids content (SSC), SSC/titratable acidity (TA), lycopene, and ascorbic acid contents. Similar effects on fruit dry matter content and SSC were also observed with the `RST-04-106-T' rootstock, although little to no change was seen with grafting onto `SHIELD RZ F1 (61-802)'. Further studies are needed to elucidate the impact of rootstock vigor on tomato volatile profiles and consumer sensory acceptability in order to better determine whether any of the documented effects are of practical importance. On the other hand, the evident effects of scion cultivar and planting season on fruit quality were observed in most of the measurements. The scion by rootstock interaction affected fruit length, firmness, pH, and total phenolic content, while the planting season by rootstock interaction impacted fruit firmness, pH, total antioxidant capacity, and ascorbic acid and lycopene contents. The multivariate separation pattern of planting season, scion, and rootstock treatments as revealed by the canonical discriminant analysis further indicated that the influence of scion cultivar and planting season on tomato fruit quality could be much more pronounced than the rootstock effects. The fruit color (C* and H degrees), length and width, SSC, pH, total antioxidant capacity, ascorbic acid, and lycopene contents were the main attributes distinguishing different scion-planting season groups.},

Alternative water sources, such as saline water, require ad hoc solutions. Therefore, understanding roots' response to saline water is crucial for future agriculture. We examined the response of three grapevine rootstocks (Paulsen 1103, Richter 110 and SO4) to salt stress. The rootstocks were subjected to two salinity treatments: 10 mM and 30 mM NaCl (EC = 2 and 4 ds/m, respectively). Root and shoot samples were taken at the end of the experiment for morphologic and ionomic analyses. The specific root area (SRA) increased in response to salinity for all three rootstocks due to root tissue density and average root diameter reductions. Salinity also led to increased root Na+ and Cl- contents and reduced root K+/Na+ ratio, parallel to increased leaf Cl- but not Na+ contents. SO4 showed improved chloride and sodium exclusion, concomitant with its highest SRA, resulting from the increase in its thin roots' contribution to the total root system surface area. We suggest that enhanced SRA combined with decreased root tissue density and diameter may improve grapevines' salt exclusion by less salt uptake from the soil.},

	abstract = {Background and Aim. The genetically determined characteristics of grapevine rootstocks are important factors that affect scion performance. This 3 years' field study aimed to characterize the influence of four well-established 30-year-old rootstocks (110 Richter, 1103 Paulsen, 41B, and 161-49Couderc) on the Tempranillo cultivar in the semiarid wine growing region of D.O.Ca. Rioja, North-Eastern Spain. Methods and Results. Nutrient concentrations of mineral elements at flowering and veraison were determined in the vines, jointly with grapevine-water status, gas exchange, vine vigour, and chlorophyll content. Moreover, grapevine yield and grape quality were determined at harvest. The least vigorous rootstocks (41B, 161-49C) conferred drought adaptability traits by increasing water use efficiency (WUE) and decreasing whole-plant water conductance per unit leaf area (K-plant) compared to the more vigorous rootstocks (1103-P, 110-R). In contrast, the more vigorous rootstocks increased water transport capacity, which led to higher plant performance and nutrient uptake efficiency. At flowering, 1103-P and to a lesser extent, 110-R were most efficient at taking up nutrients, while 161-49C had the lowest concentrations for most nutrients. At veraison, 41B exhibited closer behaviour to 110-R than 161-49C, while 1103-P and 161-49C remained the most differentiated rootstocks, with higher and lower nutrient uptake, respectively. In addition, compared to the more vigorous rootstocks, the yield was up to 1.6 kg lower for the less vigorous rootstocks but the grape composition was improved. Notably, 161-49C led to higher total soluble solids, total acidity, and polyphenol content. Conclusions. Overall, grafting onto specific rootstocks represents a strategy to confer differential regulation of grapevine water-saving strategies, yield, berry quality, and nutrient uptake potential. Significance of the Study. This information may be useful for growers seeking to develop a site-specific selection of rootstocks for the grafted Tempranillo cv.},

A greenhouse experiment was conducted to study the impact of the microbiological quality of the soil and grapevine rootstock genotype on the root microbial community and development of young plants. Two rootstocks heterografted with the same scion were grown in two vineyard soils differing in microbial composition and activities. After 4 months, culture-dependent approaches and amplicon sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal ITS were performed on roots, rhizosphere and bulk soil samples. The root mycorrhizal colonization and number of cultivable microorganisms in the rhizosphere compartment of both genotypes were clearly influenced by the soil status. The fungal diversity and richness were dependent on the soil status and the rootstock, whereas bacterial richness was affected by the genotype only. Fungal genera associated with grapevine diseases were more abundant in declining soil and related root samples. The rootstock affected the compartmentalization of microbial communities, underscoring its influence on microorganism selection. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) confirmed the presence of predominant root-associated bacteria.

Several rootstock varieties have been reported to improve the resistance of Cabernet Sauvignon to Colomerus vitis. This study explored the influence of Cabernet Sauvignon with different rootstocks on the resistance to Colomerus vitis. In particular, Cabernet Sauvignon/Cabernet Sauvignon (CS/CS) was selected as the control, and Cabernet Sauvignon grafted with five resistant rootstocks (3309C, 1103P, 140R, SO4, and 5C) was employed as the treatment. The infestation rate and injury index of Colomerus vitis to grapevines was investigated, and insect-resistant types of grapevines with different rootstocks were determined. The resveratrol (Res) content, the gene expression of resveratrol synthase (RS), and the activities of peroxidase (POD), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the leaves of each rootstock grapevine were measured. The activity of the four enzymes and the content of Res were negatively correlated with the injury index. The results revealed the ability of the rootstock to improve the resistance of grapevines to Colomerus vitis by increasing the enzyme activity or Res content. In particular, 140R, SO4, and 5C rootstocks can be employed as rootstocks of the `Cabernet Sauvignon' grapevine with resistance to Colomerus vitis. The contents of Res and the four resistance enzymes studied here can be used as indexes to evaluate the insect resistance of rootstock-scion combinations.},

Grafting is a proven and effective tool to enhance plant drought resistance ability by regulating their physiological and molecular processes. In this review, we have summarized the current understanding, mechanisms, and perspectives of the drought stress resistance of grafted plants. Plants resist drought through adaptive changes in their root, stem, and leaf morphology and structure, stomatal closure modulation to reduce transpiration, activating osmoregulation, enhancing antioxidant systems, and regulating phytohormones and gene expression changes. Additionally, the mRNAs, miRNAs and peptides crossing the grafted healing sites also confer drought resistance. However, the interaction between phytohormones, establishment of the scion-rootstock communication through genetic materials to enhance drought resistance is becoming a hot research topic. Therefore, our review provides not only physiological evidences for selecting drought-resistant rootstocks or scions, but also a clear understanding of the potential molecular effects to enhance drought resistance using grafted plants.},

The study aimed to investigate how three bench grafting methods [i.e., (i) Omega graft as mechanical technique, (ii) Whip and Tongue graft as manual technique and (iii) Full Cleft graft as semi-mechanical technique] can influence these phenomena. Specifically, the different methods were compared for their effect on the anatomical development of the grafting point and the functionality of the xylem, also considering two factors: the grapevine cultivar (Cabernet Sauvignon, Glera and Teroldego) and the scion/rootstock diameter (thin and large). Observations by light microscopy on the anatomical evolution and measurements on the xylem morphology and hydraulic traits were correlated with the grafting methods and the investigated varieties. The anatomical observations revealed that the mechanical (Omega) and semi-mechanical (Full Cleft) grafting methods have a faster callusing response while the manual technique (Whip and Tongue) has a slower but greater vascularization of the differentiated callus. Significant differences between cultivars and/or grafting types were also detected in necrotic area on the grafted tissues. Statistical analysis of the grapevine vessels suggested differences in xylem parameters between cultivars, while grafting type had no significant effects. On the other hand, the grafting type significantly affected the intrinsic growth rate. The study confirms the potential incidence of lesions and dysfunctionalities correlated with the grafting method applied, which can potentially induce grafted vine declines in vineyards due to the necrotic area detected on the grafted tissues.},

In this experiment of grafted grape tomato production in an organically man-aged high tunnel system, we characterized the effects of vegetative and generative rootstock cultivars on tomato yield components and fruit mineral contents. Grape to-mato scions `BHN 1022' (determinate) and `Sweet Hearts' (indeterminate) were grafted onto `DR0141TX' (vegetative), `Estamino' (generative), and `Multifort' (non -characterized) rootstocks with self-and nongrafted scions as controls. Experiments were conducted twice with different transplanting dates (Expt. 1: 31 Jan. vs. Expt. 2: 9 Mar.) in 2018. No rootstock by scion interaction effects on whole-season fruit yield components were observed, indicating similar responses of determinate and indeterminate grape tomato scions to all rootstocks tested. For Expt. 1, the three rootstocks increased marketable fruit number, marketable yield, and total yield by 23.3\%, 37.9\%, and 34.4\% on average, respectively, compared with the self-and nongrafted controls, primarily due to improved productivity during the peak and late harvest periods. For Expt. 2, the rootstocks did not significantly benefit any whole-season yield components. `DR0141TX' and `Multifort' increased stem diameter in both ex-periments, whereas `Estamino' only increased stem diameter in Expt. 2 relative to the nongrafted controls. Consistent increase in aboveground dry biomass of rootstock treatments at crop termination in Expt. 1 corresponded to the greater yield of root-stock-grafted plants in that experiment. All rootstocks in both experiments consistently increased fruit P, K, Ca, Zn, and Fe contents on a dry weight basis at peak harvest regardless of the tomato scion used. Despite a relatively low level of root-knot nematode infestation, plants grafted with `DR0141TX' or `Estamino' tended to have lower root galling index ratings than scion controls and `Multifort'-grafted plants, which was more evident in Expt. 1. Given the different environmental conditions during the tomato production period between the two experiments conducted in high tunnels, our findings highlight the important influence of production environment on grafted tomato performance. This study on grafted grape tomatoes in high tunnel organic production systems also demonstrated that so-called “vegetative “ and “generative “ rootstocks had similar impacts on tomato scion yield components and fruit mineral contents.},

No study has been conducted in which the effects of rootstock on grape tomato quality attributes were assessed using sensory and instrumental methods of evaluation. Here, we conducted two experiments to examine the influence of `DR0141TX', `Estamino', and `Multifort' rootstocks (vegetative, generative, and uncharacterized, respectively) on fruit quality properties of determinate and indeterminate grape tomato scions under organic production in high tunnels, including color, size, firmness, dry matter content, soluble solids content (SSC), titratable acidity (TA), pH, and consumer sensory attributes. RESULTS In both experiments, grafting `Sweet Hearts' indeterminate grape tomato onto `DR0141TX', `Estamino', or `Multifort' increased fruit size and led to negligible effects on sensory attributes and instrumental measurements of fruit quality attributes. For `BHN 1022' determinate grape tomato, rootstocks did not exhibit any major impact on fruit quality attributes in Experiment 1. However, fruit quality was compromised by grafting per se and rootstocks, especially `Multifort', in Experiment 2, as reflected by reduced SSC, TA, and SSC/TA and lower scores for overall appearance, overall acceptability, tomato flavor, overall texture, and sweetness. CONCLUSION In general, `vegetative' and `generative' rootstocks showed comparable effects on sensory evaluations and instrumental measurements of grape tomato quality attributes for both indeterminate and determinate scions.

New combinations of scions and hybrid rootstocks may provide better performance than current commercial selections for Florida's fresh citrus production, particularly in the Indian River District. The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare University of Florida rootstocks and other recently released rootstocks grafted with grapefruit, navel orange, and mandarin scions by measuring tree growth and HLB tolerance. Three independent large-scale field trials were established in September 2019 in Fort Pierce, FL, USA. Trial 1 (T1) included 36 rootstocks with `Ray Ruby' grapefruit as the scion; Trials 2 and 3 (T2 and T3, respectively) included 30 rootstocks with `Glenn' navel orange F-56-11 and `UF-950' mandarin as the scion, respectively. Tree canopy volume, trunk diameter, CLas titer, HLB severity index, and leaf nutrient concentrations were evaluated during 2020 and 2021. Significant differences among rootstock-scion combinations were found in each trial for most of the assessed traits. In T2, UFR-15 consistently developed the largest `Ray Ruby' grapefruit trees during both years. In T3, `Glenn' navel orange F-56-11 trees were larger on C-22, and US-802. Similarly, US-802 and US-942 generated the largest `UF-950' mandarin trees. Overall, trees had optimum levels of macro- and micronutrients except for calcium. CLas infection and HLB visual index varied among scion-rootstock combinations, especially during the first year of growth when intensive flushing was produced. Generally, trees grew vigorously with WGFT+50-7 and Willits inducing the lowest HLB symptoms in all evaluations.

In the study, `Rizessi', `celiksu', `ulkemiz', `Rizellim', and `Rizpem' foxy grape varieties were grafted on 140Ru, SO4, and 110R American rootstocks. The graft success, growth, and development characteristics were determined, and carbohydrate accumulations and distributions at the graft area, under the graft area (rootstock), and above the graft area (scion) of the grafted grapevines in the dormant period were also determined. The highest graft success rate was 100.00\% in the combinations of `Rizessi'/SO4, `Rizellim'/SO4, `Rizpem'/SO4, `Rizellim'/110R, and `Rizpem'/110R. The percentage of vine saplings ranged from 86.00\% ('Rizellim'/SO4) to 27.14\% ('Rizpem'/140Ru). Regarding carbohydrate distribution, the `Rizessi'/140Ru, `Rizessi'/SO4, `Rizessi'/110R, `celiksu'/SO4, `celiksu'/110R, `ulkemiz'/SO4, `Rizellim'/140Ru, `Rizellim'/SO4, `Rizpem'/SO4, and `Rizpem'/110R combinations showed a balanced distribution. The highest total carbohydrate accumulation (100.41 mg center dot L-1) was detected in the root region of the `ulkemiz'/SO4 combination. On the other hand, vine sapling rate enhanced as carbohydrate accumulation increased in the grafting area. The SO4 American rootstock was found to be more successful than the others.},

In this study, different tolerant behavior of wild grapevines as rootstock in grafted scion varieties were explored under different levels of PEG-6000 mediated drought stress i.e., -4.00, -6.00, and -8.00 bars. In response to drought stress, wild grapevines evoked several non-enzymatic and enzymatic activities. Among non-enzymatic activities, total chlorophyll contents of commercial varieties were sustained at higher level when grafted on wild grapevines Dakh and Fatati which subsequently reduced the damage of cell membrane via MDA. Whereas, to cope the membranous damage due to excessive cellular generation of ROS, wild grapevines triggered the enhanced activities of SOD to dismutase the free oxygen radicals into H2O2, then CAT enzyme convert the H2O2 into water molecules. Higher accumulation of ROS in commercial scion varieties were also coped by wild grapevines Dakh and Fatati through the upregulation of POD and APX enzymes activities. Based on these enzymatic and non-enzymatic indices, biplot and cluster analysis classified the wild grapevines as rootstock into three distinct categories comprises on relatively tolerant i.e., Dakh (Vitis vinifera subsp. sylvestris) and Fatati (Vitis vinifera subsp. sativa), moderate tolerant i.e., Toran (Vitis vinifera subsp. sylvestris) and relatively susceptible category i.e., Zarishk (Vitis vinifera subsp. sylvestris).},

Conversely, rootstocks increased the total aroma content of Marselan berry, verified by the related expression levels of volatile-related genes. For Marselan berry, 5BB and 1103P upregulated five VvGTs and nine genes from the LOX and MEP pathway. 1103P increased the contents of C6 alcohols, C6 aldehydes, and citronellol from Marselan berry.

	abstract = {`Nemaguard' is a commonly used rootstock for almond and stone fruits due to resistance to nematodes and enhanced scion vigor. Nemaguard also happens to be resistant to strains of Xylella fastidiosa that cause almond leaf scorch disease. Previous research showed that prior to June-budding, this rootstock can prevent infection of almond nursery stock by X. fastidiosa. Further, the rootstock also promotes recovery from infection in susceptible almond scions. Objectives of this study were to 1) compare movement and bacterial populations of X. fastidiosa in almond and Nemaguard, 2) determine whether the metabolic profile of infected versus noninfected plants of each species correspond with differences in pathogen distribution, and 3) evaluate the impact of feeding on Nemaguard on transmission efficiency and pathogen populations in insects. Results showed limited or no movement of X. fastidiosa beyond the point of mechanical inoculation in Nemaguard, whereas X. fastidiosa was detected in susceptible almond and isolated from plant samples distal to the point of inoculation. Large differences in the concentration of phenolic compounds between Nemaguard and almond were also found, although this was not impacted by infection status. After acquiring X. fastidiosa from infected plants, vector access periods of up to 14 days on Nemaguard neither reduced pathogen populations in vectors nor reduced transmission efficiency of X. fastidiosa to susceptible plants when compared with similar vector-access periods on susceptible grapevines. Results suggest Nemaguard, in spite of having high phenolic concentrations in its xylem, does not directly impact X. fastidiosa survival and that future research should focus on identification of potential physical traits that prevent bacterial attachment, multiplication, or movement within the plant.},

	abstract = {The use of more salt stress-tolerant vine rootstocks can be a sustainable strategy for adapting traditional grapevine cultivars to future conditions. However, how the new M1 and M4 rootstocks perform against salinity compared to conventional ones, such as the 1103-Paulsen, had not been previously assessed under real field conditions. Therefore, a field trial was carried out in a young `Tempranillo' (Vitis vinifera L.) vineyard grafted onto all three rootstocks under a semi-arid and hot-summer Mediterranean climate. The vines were irrigated with two kinds of water: a non-saline Control with EC of 0.8 dS m(-1) and a Saline treatment with 3.5 dS m(-1). Then, various physiological parameters were assessed in the scion, and, additionally, gene expression was studied by high throughput sequencing in leaf and berry tissues. Plant water relations evidenced the osmotic effect of water quality, but not that of the rootstock. Accordingly, leaf-level gas exchange rates were also reduced in all three rootstocks, with M1 inducing significantly lower net photosynthesis rates than 1103-Paulsen. Nevertheless, the expression of groups of genes involved in photosynthesis and amino acid metabolism pathways were not significantly and differentially expressed. The irrigation with saline water significantly increased leaf chloride contents in the scion onto the M-rootstocks, but not onto the 1103P. The limitation for leaf Cl- and Na+ accumulation on the scion was conferred by rootstock. Few processes were differentially regulated in the scion in response to the saline treatment, mainly, in the groups of genes involved in the flavonoids and phenylpropanoids metabolic pathways. However, these transcriptomic effects were not fully reflected in grape phenolic ripeness, with M4 being the only one that did not cause reductions in these compounds in response to salinity, and 1103-Paulsen having the highest overall concentrations. These results suggest that all three rootstocks confer short-term salinity tolerance to the scion. The lower transcriptomic changes and the lower accumulation of potentially phytotoxic ions in the scion grafted onto 1103-Paulsen compared to M-rootstocks point to the former being able to maintain this physiological response in the longer term. Further agronomic trials should be conducted to confirm these effects on vine physiology and transcriptomics in mature vineyards.},

We evaluated the effect of deficit irrigation on glycosylated volatile organic compounds (VOCs) responsible for the aroma of berries of Sangiovese and Merlot cultivars grafted on 1103P or SO4 rootstocks. Methods and Results Vines were subjected to either pre- or post-veraison water stress, and berry composition compared against that of fruit of fully irrigated vines. At harvest, a higher concentration of glycosylated VOCs was measured in berries from vines stressed pre-veraison, but while it increased as water deficit increased in Sangiovese, this occurred only at a low or moderate level of stress in Merlot. Post-veraison water stress had a negative or negligible effect on the concentration of glycosylated VOCs in berries at harvest. The rootstock affected the concentration of glycosylated VOCs, particularly in vines stressed pre-veraison, with higher glycosylated VOCs observed for SO4 grafted vines than for 1103P grafted vines. Conclusions Pre-veraison water deficit enhanced the concentration of berry glycosylated VOCs, while post-veraison deficit did not. The rootstock-scion interaction might amplify the irrigation effect on berry glycosylated VOCs. Significance of the Study Modifying the timing and volume of irrigation might allow management of berry flavour for improved fruit and wine composition.

In Pakistan, wild grapevine accessions locally called Dakh, Fatati, Toran, Zarishk, and Kishmish naturally exist in mountainous and sub-mountainous regions of humid and sub-humid areas. However, many vineyards that are cultivated as own rooted crops have been affected by many environmental or edaphic conditions. To cope with these adverse conditions, it is the utmost need to cultivate highly productive Vitis varieties with suitable rootstocks, but compatibility is a major concern between these grafted plants. In the present study, in vitro cleft grafting was used to evaluate the compatibility of these wild grapevine accessions as rootstocks with other commercial scion varieties like King's Ruby and Flame Seedless. Wild grapevine accessions Dakh, Kishmish, and Toran showed a relatively improved rate of compatibility with commercial scion varieties compared to Zarishk and Fatati accessions. Initially, a slower but stable process of graft compatibility between wild grapevine accessions and scion varieties was observed at 10 days after grafting. Differentiation of parenchymatous cells into vascular bundles started at 15 days after grafting, whereas complete formation of vascular bundles at graft junctions of wild grapevine accessions and commercial scion varieties was observed at 21 days after grafting. This initiation of vascular layers at the initial stage helped the improvement of shoot growth of scion varieties grafted on wild grapevine accessions Dakh and Kishmish. Moreover, a higher rate of root growth was observed in grafted wild grapevine accessions Dakh, Zarishk, and Kishmish compared to Fatati and Toran. Among both commercial scion varieties, King's Ruby resulted (54-59\%) as more effective when grafted with wild grapevine accessions.},

Dogridge is the only commercially popular rootstock held by the Indian grape industry, owing to its several advantages with respect to moisture stress tolerance, exclusion of chloride and improving scion vigour. However, over-dependence on a single rootstock might pose a serious threat to the grape industry; thus, broadening the genetic base of Dogridge is inevitable to address introgression of candidate genes that can adapt to diverse adverse situations, especially with respect to tolerance to sodicity, which is lacking in Dogridge. Flowering in Dogridge is challenging and induction of the reproductive phase from the vegetative phase in Dogridge needs to be attempted. Pruning was found to be successful, and this study focussed on pruning timings and severity. The investigation was conducted at ICAR-Indian Institute of Horticultural Research, Bengaluru. Pruning timings from September Iota fortnight to January Iota Iota fortnight along with pruning severity of five to eight bud levels were conducted. Observations related to flower set percentage and fruit set percentage were recorded, and key growth stages were depicted. These parameters were associated with maximum and minimum temperature. Pruning timings of January Iota and December Iota Iota fortnight produced the highest flowering, followed by October Iota and September Iota Iota fortnight pruning, while the highest percentage of fruit set was accounted for in October Iota and September Iota Iota fortnight pruning. Similarly, per cent flowering and per cent fruit set was also affected by pruning severity and was highest in 5th and 6th bud level pruning. Lower minimum temperature of 11-13 degrees C and higher diurnal temperature variation favoured the highest per cent flowering in December Iota Iota and January Iota fortnight pruning, while higher maximum temperature during fruit development hampered fruitfulness. However, the temperature prevailed during the reproductive stage of Dogridge when pruned in September Iota Iota and October Iota fortnight resulted in higher numbers of flowers and fruit set. This information may boost rootstock breeding in Dogridge to improve its drought and salinity.},

Grafting V. vinifera scions to Cl–excluding hybrid rootstocks reduces the impact of salinity. Molecular components underlying Cl–exclusion in Vitis species remain largely unknown, however, various anion channels and transporters represent good candidates for controlling this trait. Here, two nitrate/peptide transporter family (NPF) members VviNPF2.1 and VviNPF2.2 were isolated. Both highly homologous proteins localized to the plasma membrane of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) protoplasts. Both were expressed primarily in grapevine roots and leaves and were more abundant in a Cl–excluding rootstock compared to a Cl–includer. Quantitative PCR of grapevine roots revealed that VviNPF2.1 and 2.2 expression was downregulated by high [NO3-] resupply post-starvation, but not affected by 25 mM Cl-. VviNPF2.2 was functionally characterized using an Arabidopsis enhancer trap line as a heterologous host which enabled cell-type-specific expression. Constitutive expression of VviNPF2.2 exclusively in the root epidermis and cortex reduced shoot [Cl-] after a 75 mM NaCl treatment. Higher expression levels of VviNPF2.2 correlated with reduced Arabidopsis xylem sap [NO3-] when not salt stressed. We propose that when expressed in the root epidermis and cortex, VviNPF2.2 could function in passive anion efflux from root cells, which reduces the symplasmic Cl- available for root-to-shoot translocation. VviNPF2.2, through its role in the root epidermis and cortex, could, therefore, be beneficial to plants under salt stress by reducing net shoot Cl- accumulation.},

Methods and Results An experimental procedure comparing omega grafted vines with complete alignment of the scion and the rootstock (CA) and vines with partial alignment (PA) was developed. Three complementary trials were carried out in the nursery, in the field and under controlled conditions. The CA vines increased the success rate in the nursery. Vine growth was significantly affected by the alignment between the rootstock and scion both in the nursery and in their first year of establishment in a commercial vineyard and in a potted trial, although these differences dissipated in years 2 and 3 under commercial vineyard conditions. The CA graft also maintained a higher level of leaf gas exchange, but such differences did not correspond to those in the hydraulic conductivity across the graft union itself. Conclusions The degree of alignment of the grafted vine material affected vine development, but a better understanding of the role of vascular connections in different graft types and qualities is needed.

	abstract = {This review highlights the contributions of CSIRO to the development of new scions and rootstocks for the Australian winegrape, driedgrape and tablegrape industries. Initially, CSIRO played a pivotal role in the selection of high-yielding Sultana clones which contributed over half the total Australian grape crop in the 1970s used for wine- and driedgrape production. It was also responsible for importation and evaluation of the Salt Creek (syn. Ramsey) rootstock which provided tolerance to root-knot nematodes and salinity and became the most widely adopted rootstock for the emerging Australian wine industry in the 1980-1990s. The CSIRO has also successfully bred or released several new grape cultivars. While the adoption rate for the CSIRO wine cultivars has been limited, CSIRO-selected cultivars dominate the Australian driedgrape industry, while CSIRO-released cultivars continue to play an important role in the Australian tablegrape industry. In the 1990s, CSIRO commenced the application of molecular biology techniques for grapevine germplasm improvement. Researchers from CSIRO were some of the first in the world to successfully regenerate transgenic grapevines and demonstrate the potential of this technology to produce low-browning driedgrapes and mildew-resistant premium winegrapes. More recently, the focus has shifted to the mapping of resistance loci from wild grape species and their introgression into new winegrape scions to provide resistance to mildews and new rootstocks to provide durable resistance to rootknot nematodes and phylloxera. Finally, this review considers some future challenges faced by the Australian grape industries and how these might be addressed using conventional or molecular breeding strategies.},

	abstract = {Grafting is a method for plant propagation and improvement. In the European viticulture, grafting is the sole control strategy against Phylloxera injuries and thus is of crucial importance for sustainable grape production. Despite its benefits, grafting is also a source for disease dissemination and graft incompatibility sometimes detected long after grafting can result in propagation losses. However, the physiology of grafting, such as compatibility factors, callus formation and healing processes, and the signaling components exchanged between scion and rootstock, are still not well understood by the scientific community. Recent insights in grafting research hint at a complex scion-rootstock communication. Molecules exchanged between rootstock and scion, such as hormones, metabolites, proteins, and RNAs coordinate the grafted plant parts and are suspected to modulate the healing of the union and to facilitate the regeneration of the vascular tissues. Such processes result in a successful grafted plant but in many cases, the graft develops distress symptoms, which can appear in early or late stages of plant growth eventually leading to a so-called `graft incompatibility'. It is not known whether the cause of incompatibility is based on a rejection of the opposing partners, on growth differences, or on the stress induced by grafting itself. One potential factor leading to graft incompatibility can be based on a deficiency of the recognition of graft-transmissible RNA signals shown to coordinate developmental and environmental shoot-root responses. This review summarizes the current knowledge on grafting from the perspective of viticulture, discusses the hypotheses behind graft incompatibility, addresses the molecular effects of grafting, and novel research perspectives that might help to unveil this millenary mystery.},

To test our hypothesis, we investigated at a field scale the bacterial and fungal communities associated with the root system of seven grapevine rootstock-scion combinations cultivated across 10 different vineyards. Following the soil type, which resulted in the main determinant of the grapevine root microbial community diversity, the rootstock-scion combination resulted more important than the two components taken alone. Notably, the microbiome differences among the rootstock-scion combinations were mainly dictated by the changes in the relative abundance of microbiome members rather than by their presence/absence.

The vascular system of grapevine rootstocks in nurseries is still an underexplored niche for research, despite its potential for hosting beneficial and pathogenic microorganisms. The purpose of this study was to investigate the changes in the composition of fungal communities in 110 Richter and 41 Berlandieri rootstocks at four stages of the grapevine propagation process. Taxonomic analysis revealed that the fungal community predominantly consisted of phylum Ascomycota in all stages of the propagation process. The alpha-diversity of fungal communities differed among sampling times for both rootstocks, with richness and fungal diversity in the vascular system decreasing through the propagation process. The core microbiome was composed of the genera Cadophora, Cladosporium, Penicillium and Alternaria in both rootstocks, while the pathogenic genus Neofusicoccum was identified as a persistent taxon throughout the propagation process. FUNguild analysis showed that the relative abundance of plant pathogens associated with trunk diseases increased towards the last stage in nurseries. Fungal communities in the vascular system of grapevine rootstocks differed between the different stages of the propagation process in nurseries. Numerous genera associated with potential biocontrol activity and grapevine trunk diseases were identified. Understanding the large diversity of fungi in the rootstock vascular tissue and the interactions between fungal microbiota and grapevine will help to develop sustainable strategies for grapevine protection.},

This motivated further study of the etiology and epidemiology of the disease by undertaking studies to determine distribution of the pathogens throughout almond nursery propagation systems and trace possible sources of inoculum. Research initiated in 2013 detected pathogenic Fusarium spp. throughout the almond propagation system, including in healthy trees, in soils, on wheat rotation crops, on equipment, and in the cold-storage facility air. In addition to the two Fusarium spp. implicated previously, F. brachygibbosum and a new Fusarium species, F. californicum, were found to be pathogenic on almond trees. Multilocus sequence typing and somatic compatibility testing confirmed that isolates within a species collected from different materials in the nursery were all highly genetically similar and likely of one clonal lineage. These findings affirm that equipment surfaces, wheat rotation crops, soil, cold-storage facility air, and asymptomatic almond tree materials (i.e., rootstock cuttings, budwood, and scions) can potentially contribute inoculum to increase disease prevalence and severity.},

Conferred traits may interact to alter the relationship between vine water use and fruit yield, providing a mechanism whereby rootstocks could be used to improve the water use efficiency of fruit production. This study aimed to determine whether rootstock conferred vigour and crop water use index (yield per unit water transpired) were linked. Methods and Results Seven rootstock genotypes, grafted with Shiraz, in a trial established over 20 years previously, were assessed over four seasons for vigour, yield and leaf physiology, and over three seasons for whole vine transpiration using sapflow sensors. There were consistent differences in rootstock conferred traits, with yield being affected to a lesser extent than vigour or vine water use. Conclusions The water use efficiency of fruit production was improved for Shiraz on low vigour conferring rootstocks, due to a combination of rootstock conferred effects on scion vigour, leaf gas exchange, whole vine transpiration and yield. Significance of the Study The study has demonstrated that rootstock conferred traits can alter the crop water use index of the scion in a mature vineyard. Consequently, accurately matching irrigation application with vigour and leaf physiology traits of the chosen rootstock has the potential to be used as a tool to optimise vineyard water use efficiency, even in fully irrigated vineyards.},

Most of the proteins with different expression profiles converged into coordinated biosynthetic networks of primary metabolism, while many possible enzymes of secondary metabolism pathways, including 5-glucosyltransferases expected for hybrid grapes, remained unassigned due to incomplete protein annotation for the Vitis genus.

We demonstrate that the type of grafting per se dramatically influences the small RNA populations independently of genotypes but also show genotype specific effects. In addition, we demonstrate that bilateral exchanges of small RNAs, mainly short interfering RNAs, may occur in heterograft with the preferential transfer of small RNAs from the scion to the rootstock. Altogether, the results suggest that small RNAs may have an important role in the phenotype modifications observed in heterografts.},

The rootstock connects the surrounding soil to the vine's aerial part and impacts scion growth and berry quality.

The study was performed over six production cycles in the period from 2015 to 2019 in the Bebedouro experimental field of Embrapa Semiarido in Petrolina, PE, Brazil. The treatments consisted of seven grapevine rootstocks: IAC 572, IAC 766, IAC 313, Paulsen 1103, SO4, Harmony, and Freedom. The following variables were evaluated: estimated yield, number of grape bunches per plant, branch and leaf fresh matter, bunch weight, bunch length and width, berry weight, total soluble solids content (SS), titratable acidity (TA), and SS to TA ratio (SS:TA). Significant effects of the rootstock were observed in all the variables except for SS. The rootstock `IAC 572' led to increases of up to 61\% in the yield of `BRS Magna' grapevines, or 32.78 ton.ha(-1), with significant responses in the other yield components. Results of the scatterplot in relation to the first three principal components allowed separation of the rootstocks in accordance with production cycles. The mean values for SS and TA characterize this cultivar in the Vale do Submedio Sao Francisco, with high soluble solids content and low acidity resulting in high SS:TA, as having potential for preparation of high quality juices, regardless of the rootstock used.},

However, it is still not fully understood if the impact of rootstocks on fruit and wine composition is mediated by their effect on the vegetative growth and N status of the scion. The main objective of the study was to test if rootstock influence on Pinot noir berry and wine phenolic composition could be related to the N status of the scion. An investigation was carried out on Pinot noir (Vitis vinifera L.) vines grafted onto six rootstocks over three vintages (2012-2014). A micro-scale fermentation technique was used to produce wines from each field replicate. Scions grafted onto SO4, a high vigour rootstock, were characterised by a 15 \% higher tannin concentration in berry seed and skin compared to those grafted onto the low vigour Riparia Gloire de Montpellier, while final tannin concentration in wines depended on the rootstock. Anthocyanin concentration was higher in berries of Pinot noir grafted onto R110 compared to 125AA, which was also reflected in the wines. A Multiple Linear Regression analysis suggested that rootstock influence on berry anthocyanins was linked to the N status of scion leaves (higher Leaf NBI\_R). Understanding the interaction between the N uptake efficiency of rootstocks and scion berry/wine phenolic composition will help improve the selection of suitable rootstocks that match the desired wine profile.},

However, little literature is available concerning the scion-mediated effect on P efficiency in grafted plants. In this study, three different Camellia oleifera Abel. scion cultivars (G8, G83-1, and W2) were grafted onto the same rootstock (W2) under controls (0.5 mM) and low-P (0 mM) availability for eight months. The results showed that the scions significantly affected root-to-shoot weight ratios, the root morphology with a diameter larger than 1 mm, P accumulation, and the P utilization efficiency (PUE) of the root. A higher increase in the root-to-shoot weight ratio under the low-P supply was observed in the G83-1/W2 (26.15\%) than in the G8/W2 (0\%) and the W2/W2 (5.32\%). Root PUE of the scion G8, G83-1, and W2 was improved by up to 113.73\%, 45.46\%, and 20.97\% under the low-P supply. Moreover, G8/W2 exhibited higher shoot P accumulation and the highest root PUE under the low-P supply, indicating a high capability to tolerate P deficiency by maximizing the cost-effectiveness of P remobilization to photosynthetic organs. This suggested the vigorous variety of G8 could be a promising scion to improve grafted C. oleifera tolerance to low-P stress. Our results would have important implications for exploration and identification of a superior scion variety to enhance the ability of resistance concerning P deficiency stress in C. oleifera.},

The early identification of graft incompatibility could allow the selection of non-viable plants before planting and would have a beneficial impact on research and development in the nursery sector. In general, visible phenotypes of grafted plants (size, root number, etc.) are poorly correlated with grafting success, but some studies have suggested that some polyphenols could be used as markers of graft incompatibility several months or years after grafting. However, much of the previous studies into metabolite markers of grafting success have not included all the controls necessary to unequivocally validate the markers proposed. In this study, we quantified 73 primary and secondary metabolites in nine hetero-grafts and six homo-grafted controls 33 days after grafting at the graft interface and in both the scion and rootstock woody tissues. Certain biomarker metabolites typical of a high stress status (such as proline, GABA and pallidol) were particularly accumulated at the graft interface of the incompatible scion/rootstock combination. We then used correlation analysis and generalized linear models to identify potential metabolite markers of grafting success measured one year after grafting. Here we present the first attempt to quantitatively predict graft compatibility and identify marker metabolites (especially asparagine, trans-resveratrol, trans-piceatannol and alpha-viniferin) 33 days after grafting, which was found to be particularly informative for homo-graft combinations.},

Grafting has crucial effects on various phenotypes of the cultivar, including its phenology, biotic and abiotic resistance, berry metabolome, and coloration, but the underlying genetics and regulatory mechanisms are largely unexplored. In this study, we investigated the phenotypic, metabolomic, and transcriptomic profiles at three developmental stages (45, 75, and 105 days after flowering) of the Crimson Seedless cultivar (Vitis vinifera) grafted onto four rootstocks (three heterografts, CS/101-14, CS/SO4, and CS/110R and one self-graft, CS/CS) with own-rooted graft-free Crimson Seedless (CS) as the control. All the heterografts had a significant effect on berry reddening as early as similar to 45 days after flowering. The grafting of rootstocks promoted anthocyanin biosynthesis and accumulation in grape berries. The metabolomic features showed that cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, delphinidin 3-O-glucoside, malvidin 3-O-glucoside, peonidin 3-O-glucoside, and petunidin 3-O-glucoside were the pigments responsible for the purplish-red peel color. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that anthocyanin biosynthesis-related genes, from upstream (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase) to downstream (anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosyltransferase and anthocyanidin synthase), were upregulated with the accumulation of anthocyanins in the heterografted plants. At the same time, all these genes were also highly expressed and more anthocyanin was accumulated in self-grafted CS/CS samples compared with own-rooted graft-free CS samples, suggesting that self-grafting may also have promoted berry reddening in grapevine. Our results reveal global transcriptomic and metabolomic features in berry color regulation under different grafting conditions that may be useful for improving berry quality in viticulture.},

However, there is limited understanding of the effects of rootstocks on grape phenolic compounds, which are located primarily in the berry skin and contribute to certain sensory attributes of wine. In this study, scion-rootstock interactions were investigated at the green-berry stage and the veraison stage when grapevines were hetero-grafted with three commonly used rootstock genotypes (5BB, 101-14MG, and SO4). Physiological investigations showed that hetero-grafts, especially CS/5BB, contained higher concentrations of total proanthocyanidins (PAs) and various PA components in berry skins compared with the auto-grafted grapevines. Further metabolomics analysis identified 105 differentially accumulated flavonoid compounds, the majority of which, including anthocyanins, PAs, and flavonols, were significantly increased in the berry skins of hetero-grafted grapevines compared with auto-grafted controls. In addition, transcriptomic analysis of the same samples identified several thousand differentially expressed genes between hetero-grafted and auto-grafted vines. The three rootstocks not only increased the transcript levels of stilbene, anthocyanin, PA, and flavonol synthesis genes but also affected the expression of numerous transcription factor genes. Taken together, our results suggest that hetero-grafting can promote phenolic compound accumulation in grape berry skin during development. These findings provide new insights for improving the application value of grafting by enhancing the accumulation of nutritious phenolic components in grape.},

	abstract = {Grape phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae) can infest both roots and leaves of Vitis species. In commercial vineyards planted with Vitis vinifera scions grafted on rootstocks, grape phylloxera infestation is generally limited to root feeding. Vineyards are, however, increasingly subjected to vineyard-wide foliar infestations that last throughout the growing season. While some vineyards are affected by the infestation pressure of external leaf-feeding populations, other annually affected V. vinifera vineyards do not have these in their vicinity. Much is known about the damage potential of grape phylloxera root feeding; however, data on how phylloxera leaf infestation affects V. vinifera grapevines in commercial vineyards are lacking. This study, therefore, aimed to assess whether grapevine growth and yield are affected due to leaf infestation as it occurred in three commercial vineyards in the study area. Treatments were based on phylloxera leaf infestation and additional defoliation. Single-leaf carbon acquisition was measured with gas exchange analyses on healthy and galled leaves. Pruning weight and internode length were measured to assess the effect of leaf infestation and the effect of plant growth and vigour on leaf gall outbreaks. Yield quantity and quality were measured, and grapes were vinified for sensory analyses. Furthermore, using enzymatic analyses, non-structural carbohydrates were analysed in perennial wood. A significant decrease in sugar content in grapes (10 \%) and starch reserves in perennial wood (11 \%) was found in the most heavily infested vineyard. Grape must of infested plants in another vineyard furthermore showed a significantly higher level of titratable acid (7.5 \%). Significant infestation effects seen in one vineyard were not significant in the other two vineyards. No significant differences were seen for carbon acquisition, harvest quantity, wine sensory analysis, pruning weight or internode length. The overall effect of phylloxera leaf infestation in the studied vineyards was, therefore, marginal. Grapevine vigour did not differ between infested vines, insecticide-sprayed vines, and vines on which no leaf infestation outbreaks took place.

	abstract = {The production of grafted grapevine plant material is a complex process with many steps running over at least one year, from grafting to final sorting in nurseries. To reach the market in France, grafted grapevines must meet three criteria by law: resistance to a manual graft union test (or thumb test), a minimum number of three roots and a woody, lignified stem which has grown from the bud of the scion wood of at least 2 cm long. This study aimed to evaluate the possibility of using visual criteria to select good quality grafted grapevines, without the need to do the thumb test because the thumb test is manual and therefore very subjective; the test depends on the strength applied by the person who realises it. This study was done on 22 scion/rootstock combinations with different degrees of grafting success, i.e., producing different proportions of marketable plants after one year in the nursery. The three legal criteria currently used to select marketable grafted grapevines in France as well as other external and measurable criteria such as the length of lignified stem and diameter, the number of thin and thick roots, and rootstock wood diameter were measured on the 22 scion/rootstock combinations. Variation in the values for these different criteria was observed and correlations between the criteria and the number of marketable plants were studied. This data was then analysed to determine which visible criteria contribute most to identifying marketable grafts. The percentage of marketable grafts was most strongly correlated with the thumb test and positively correlated with the length of the lignified stem. The variables with the highest predictive effect for identifying marketable plants (other than the thumb test) were the number of large roots and the length of the lignified stem. The possibility of using visible criteria to screen for good quality grafted plants is discussed, but no single, or combination of criteria, was sufficiently strongly correlated with the percentage of marketable plants to replace the thumb test.},

In this study, we tested the effect of Paulsen 1103 (Vitis beriandieri x Vitis rupestris) as interstock on the grafting success, growth, and the physiological and chemical parameters of Flame seedless (Vitis vinifera) grapevine grafted onto Freedom (Vitis champinii x 1613C) and Paulsen 1103 rootstocks. This study was conducted over two seasons (2019 and 2020). The results indicated that direct grafting on the Paulsen 1103 rootstock recorded the highest grafting success percentage. Moreover, the grafting success percentage increased significantly when Paulsen 1103 was used as interstock between Flame seedless and Freedom rootstock (FI/P/Fr) compared to the grafting success without Paulsen 1103 interstock (FI/Fr). Also, using Paulsen 1103 as interstock between Flame seedless scion and Freedom rootstock (FI/P/Fr) significantly reduced the morphological parameters (shoot length, leaf area and the dry weight of shoots and roots) and physiological parameters of leaf (relative water content, transpiration rate, and stomatal conductance) but significantly increased the leaf chemical content (peroxidase activity, total phenols, total proline, and total soluble sugar content) compared to values of the parameters measured in Flame seedless grafted onto Freedom rootstock (Fl/Fr). Peroxidase activity could be used for predicting the degree of compatibility in grapevine grafts. This study suggested that the effect of Paulsen 1103 interstock on the vegetative growth of scion is correlated with its effect on chemical content and physiological responses of the scion.},

Stimulating the rapid formation of the grafting union is the key to grafting success. This investigation studied the effect of removing growth inhibitors through soaking in water for 24 hours versus adding growth stimulate through fast dipping in 250 mg/L benzyladenine (BA) for 30 seconds of graft wood before grafting on the grafting success of `Flame Seedless' and `Early Sweet' scions (Vitis vinifera) grafted onto `Freedom' rootstock (Vitis champinii x 1613C). Water soaking came first and followed by treatment of 250 mg/L BA, which significantly improved the grafting success of both cultivars. Grafting success was positively associated with increasing callus formation at the grafting zone, which was accompanied with the highest total indols content, the lowest total phenols content, and peroxidase activity above and below the grafting zone. However, water soaking significantly increased total indols and decreased the total phenols content of the ungrafted cuttings. In this study, it was suggested that the application of water soaking to grafted cuttings prior to grafting is an environmentally friendly and alternative practice for synthetic growth regulators to improve grafted cuttings success.},

Passive and active methods can be used to reduce or prevent cold damage and protect the vineyards. Passive protection methods are generally cultural practices and performed before cold damage events, such as cultivar and rootstock selection. The proper scion-rootstock combination would ideally help the vines acclimate earlier in the fall, allowing them to withstand colder weather in the fall and winter and de-acclimate later in the spring to minimise the late spring frost damage. The introduction of new North American hybrid cultivars accompanied with other cultural practices has increased the hope for developing viticulture in areas with lower cold hardiness zones. Furthermore, active protection methods are usually performed at the time of cold damage events to protect the vineyard by preventing or reducing the loss of thermal energy from vine tissues.

	abstract = {European grapevine is a complex holobiont composed of two plant genomes, that of the scion (Vitis vinifera L.) and the rootstock (Vitis spp.), and a multitude of microbial genomes that collectively form the microbiome. The grapevine microbiome has been extensively described over the last decade, primarily using metabarcoding approaches. Unfortunately, metabarcoding data alone provide little information on microbial functions and outcomes of plant-microbe interactions. Here we review knowledge about the microorganisms that have a demonstrated influence, positive or negative, on the performance of the grapevine holobiont. Our review encompasses bacteria, filamentous fungi, yeasts, oomycetes and viruses. It covers aboveground and belowground micro-organisms, including arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal fungi. We focus on taxa and functions that protect the plant against pathogens and pests, promote growth, increase tolerance to abiotic stresses and highlight those involved in disease and decline. As the outcomes of plant-microbe interactions are labile, we examine the dynamics and functions of grapevine-microbiome interactions over both the plant lifetime and the plant evolutionary history, beginning with plant domestication. Based on the knowledge and gaps we identify, we suggest field sampling designs, culture-based experiments, molecular tools and theoretical analysis methods, including shotgun metagenomics and network models, that could be used in future research to uncover and leverage the full functional potential of the grapevine microbiome.},

The successful plant propagation relies on adventitious root formation, but it is affected by the scion-rootstock interaction. Synthetic auxins are used in the nursery to improve rooting of woody cuttings.

We tested 5 rootstocks (V. berlandieri x V. riparia), 110 Richter and 1103 Paulsen (V. berlandieri x V. rupestris), 101-14 Mgt (V. riparia x V. rupestris) and Cereza (V. vinifera L.). After 21 days in the callus chamber, we examined the quality of the root system by means of different rooting parameters (callusing and rooting percentage and number, length and biomass of roots per cutting). Among all the rooting parameters evaluated, Cereza presented the highest values in relation to the rest of the rootstocks, followed by 101-14 Mgt, SO4, 110R and 1103P. The quality of the root system was improved in terms of number of roots, length and the total biomass on four rootstocks: Cereza, 110R, 101-14 Mgt and SO4, but not in 1103P whose rooting was unaffected by treatments. The optimal dose of IBA through quick-dip at improving rooting was rootstock-dependent, being 750 ppm for 110R, 101-14 Mgt and SO4; and 1000 ppm for Cereza. These results will contribute in reducing costs during clonal propabare-root vines.},

In the experiments, collaborative filtering algorithms and kernel-based methods were evaluated on a dataset of 251 rated interactions, reaching a F1-score of approximately 96\% for the best model. The results indicated advantages of kernel-based models over standard collaborative filtering models, as well as demonstrated the feasibility of a decision support tool to guide the choice of the best cultivars for grafting.},

	doi = {10.1093/aob/mcab132},
	abstract = {Background and Aims Living root tissues significantly constrain plant water uptake under drought, but we lack functional traits to feasibly screen diverse plants for variation in the drought responses of these tissues. Water stress causes roots to lose volume and turgor, which are crucial to root structure, hydraulics and growth. Thus, we hypothesized that root pressure-volume (p-v) curve traits, which quantify the effects of water potential on bulk root turgor and volume, would capture differences in rootstock drought tolerance. Methods We used a greenhouse experiment to evaluate relationships between root p-v curve traits and gas exchange, whole-plant hydraulic conductance and biomass under drought for eight grapevine rootstocks that varied widely in drought performance in field trials (101-14, 110R, 420A, 5C, 140-Ru, 1103P, Ramsey and Riparia Gloire), grafted to the same scion variety (Vitis vinifera `Chardonnay'). Key Results The traits varied significantly across rootstocks, and droughted vines significantly reduced root turgor loss point (pi(tlp)), osmotic potential at full hydration (pi(o)) and capacitance (C), indicating that roots became less susceptible to turgor loss and volumetric shrinkage. Rootstocks that retained a greater root volume (i.e. a lower C) also maintained more gas exchange under drought. The rootstocks that previous field trials have classified as drought tolerant exhibited significantly lower pi(tlp), pi(o) and C values in well-watered conditions, but significantly higher pi(o) and pi(tlp) values under water stress, than the varieties classified as drought sensitive. Conclusions These findings suggest that acclimation in root p-v curve traits improves gas exchange in persistently dry conditions, potentially through impacts on root hydraulics or root to shoot chemical signalling. However, retaining turgor and volume in previously unstressed roots, as these roots deplete wet soil to moderately negative water potentials, could be more important to drought performance in the deep, highly heterogenous rooting zones which grapevines develop under field conditions.},

To explore the potential of biochar-based amendments to achieve these goals in wine grape production, vineyard trials were established in the fall of 2018. Two Oregon sites were chosen with distinct soil types and climates (Willamette Valley and Rogue Valley) but planted with the same grapevine scion/rootstock Pinot noir combination. Four treatments were applied under vines at each location: no biochar-no tillage (NT); no biochar + tillage (B0); 18 tons ha(-1) biochar + tillage (B18); 35 tons ha(-1) biochar + tillage (B35). In 2019, a suite of soil health, plant, and crop variables were measured, and wines were produced after harvest. The incorporation of biochar modified the chemical and physical composition of soils at the two studied locations, increasing the bioavailability of carbon and nitrogen, their gravimetric water content and the concentration of plant available micro and macro nutrients. No responses of plant physiology parameters or productivity at either site were found after biochar incorporation when compared with controls. Conversely, a significant and gradual decrease in the amount of wine tannins was found as a result of biochar application in wines produced from grapes from the Woodhall location. Long-term field experiments are required to assess the effects of biochar on soil properties, vine physiology, productivity, and grape and wine quality several years after incorporation.},

	abstract = {Background: Modern biological approaches generate volumes of multi-dimensional data, offering unprecedented opportunities to address biological questions previously beyond reach owing to small or subtle effects. A fundamental question in plant biology is the extent to which below-ground activity in the root system influences above-ground phenotypes expressed in the shoot system. Grafting, an ancient horticultural practice that fuses the root system of one individual (the rootstock) with the shoot system of a second, genetically distinct individual (the scion), is a powerful experimental system to understand below-ground effects on above-ground phenotypes. Previous studies on grafted grapevines have detected rootstock influence on scion phenotypes including physiology and berry chemistry. However, the extent of the rootstock's influence on leaves, the photosynthetic engines of the vine, and how those effects change over the course of a growing season, are still largely unknown. Results: Here, we investigate associations between rootstock genotype and shoot system phenotypes using 5 multi-dimensional leaf phenotyping modalities measured in a common grafted scion: ionomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics, morphometrics, and physiology. Rootstock influence is ubiquitous but subtle across modalities, with the strongest signature of rootstock observed in the leaf ionome. Moreover, we find that the extent of rootstock influence on scion phenotypes and patterns of phenomic covariation are highly dynamic across the season. Conclusions: These findings substantially expand previously identified patterns to demonstrate that rootstock influence on scion phenotypes is complex and dynamic and underscore that broad understanding necessitates volumes of multi-dimensional data previously unmet.},

Across all cultivars, yield of own roots, SO4 and Schwarzmann was similar. Ramsey and 1103 Paulsen produced a higher yield without a major effect on juice composition. Dog Ridge produced excessive vigour and poor grape composition. Across the scion-rootstock combinations, high vine vigour, yield and berry mass were associated with high juice pH, K+ and malic acid and low tartaric acid. Rootstock effects on juice K+, tartaric and malic acid were stable and independent of the scion cultivar. Conclusions The performance of low-vigour cultivars was enhanced by grafting on 1103 Paulsen and Ramsey. `Scion conferred root vigour' was found under field conditions.

The objectives of this study were to identify the canker and wood rot fungal pathogens present in nursery stone fruit trees as well as in propagation material and to evaluate their pathogenicity. Isolations were made from scion and rootstock propagation material and from certified nursery stone fruit trees. The plant material sampled did not have any external symptoms. The certified nursery trees when cross-sectioned displayed brown discoloration from the pruning wound, the bud union, and often the crown. Fungal species isolated were identified by sequencing of the relevant barcoding genes and phylogenetic analyses thereof. Canker- and wood rot-associated fungi were identified. Buds used for budding had low levels of infection, with 1.2\% of dormant buds infected and 0.4\% of green buds infected. The dormant rootstock shoots had a canker pathogen incidence of 6.2\% before they were planted in the nursery fields and increased inasmuch as the ungrafted, rooted rootstock plants had 11.1\% infection with canker and wood rot pathogens. Out of 1,080 nursery trees, the canker- and wood rot-associated fungi infected 21.8\% of trees. The canker-causing pathogens that were isolated the most were Cadophora luteo olivacea and Diplodia seriata. A low incidence of wood rot fungi was found, with only 1.5\% of nursery trees infected. In total, 26 new reports of fungal species on stone fruit in South Africa were made. Of these, 22 have not been found on stone fruit worldwide. The pathogenicity trials' results confirmed the pathogenic status of these newly reported species. All of the isolates tested formed lesions significantly longer than the control, 4 months after wound inoculation of 2-year-old shoots of two plum orchards. Lasiodiplodia theobromae was the most virulent species on both plum cultivars. The results of this research showed that nursery stone fruit trees and propagation material can harbor latent infections.

	abstract = {Grapevine leafroll disease (GLD) is present in all grape-growing regions of the world and is considered the most significant grapevine viral disease. Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 3 (GLRaV-3) is considered the primary cause of GLD and in South African vineyards five genetic variant groups (I, II, III, VI and VII) have been confirmed. Biological distinctions between GLRaV-3 variants have not been fully validated. By characterising virus concentration and stress-responsive microRNA expression in GLRaV-3 infected plants, this study aimed to glean a better understanding of the possible biological distinctions between GLRaV-3 variants. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR was utilised for virus concentration ratio (VCR) determination and miRNA quantitation in GLRaV-3 positive and negative grapevines grown under greenhouse and field conditions. This study found statistically significant differences in VCRs in plants singly infected with different GLRaV-3 variants. Interestingly, no difference in mean VCRs were observed between data sets, despite notable differences in plant age, duration of GLRaV-3 infection, scion/rootstock combination and growing conditions. Several miRNAs showed statistically significant expression modulation between infected and healthy samples. miRNA expression between data sets varied substantially and a greater overall miRNA response was observed in plants with more established GLRaV-3 infections. The lack of significant differences in mean VCRs between data sets, coupled with the consistent modulation of certain miRNAs in plants that have likely been infected for longer is a promising result. This finding could indicate that successful inhibition of further virus replication by plant defence mechanisms occurred, and that these miRNAs are implicated in this response.},

	abstract = {Aims: Rootstocks provide protection against soil-borne pests and are a powerful tool to manipulate growth, fruit composition and wine-quality attributes. The present study aimed to assess the consistency of rootstock effects on the growth and fruit composition of scion varieties and identify scion x rootstock interactions. Methods and results: Vine performance and fruit composition of hot-climate, drip-irrigated, spur-pruned Chardonnay, Cabernet-Sauvignon and Shiraz, grafted on seven rootstocks, was assessed over five seasons from 2013 to 2017. Rootstocks included Ramsey, 1103 Paulsen and 140 Ruggeri and four promising selections from the CSIRO rootstock development programme. Vines were trained as quadrilateral cordons on a two-wire vertical trellis of height 1.8 m and 3.0 m row x 1.8 m vine spacing, and irrigated with 5.5-6.0 ML/ha of water each season. The study was conducted with mature vines, established in 2006, as a randomised block design with five replicates. There were significant effects of both variety and rootstock on yield, number of bunches, bunch weight, berry weight (scion only), berries per bunch, pruning weight and the Ravaz Index (yield/pruning weight). Despite identical management practices, there were large differences between scion varieties in key growth characteristics across rootstocks. Chardonnay produced a high yield (mean 25.2 kg/vine) with low pruning weight (2.3 kg/vine) and a high mean Ravaz Index value of 12.1. Shiraz had the highest yield (27.4 kg/vine) with high pruning weight (5.1 kg/vine) and a Ravaz Index of 6.3. Cabernet-Sauvignon had the lowest yield (15.9 kg/vine) and highest pruning weight (6.6 kg/vine) and a very low Ravaz Index value of 3.0. Effects of rootstock on growth characteristics were smaller than the effects of variety, with mean yields ranging from 19.5 to 25.9 kg/vine, pruning weights ranging from 3.24 to 6.13 kg/vine and mean Ravaz Index values ranging from 5.54 to 8.63. Each variety was harvested when the mean total soluble solids reached 25.0 degrees Brix. Significant effects of variety and rootstock on fruit composition, included pH, titratable acidity (scion only), malate, tartrate (scion only), yeast assimilable nitrogen (YAN); and for the red varieties, total anthocyanins (scion only) and phenolic substances (scion only). Significant interactions between scion variety and rootstocks were found for yield, number of bunches, berry weight, pruning weight and Ravaz Index. The effect of rootstock on bunch weight and berries per bunch was consistent across scions. Significant scion x rootstock interactions were also found for pH and YAN. For each variety, significant effects of rootstock on fruit composition were linked to growth characteristics. However, these relationships, based on correlation analyses, varied for each scion. Conclusions: The study has shown that growth characteristics and fruit composition of the major varieties was not consistent across seven rootstock genotypes, as significant scion x rootstock interactions were determined. Hence, different rootstocks may be required for each variety to optimise scion performance and fruit composition. The study has also shown that the new CSIRO rootstock selections, covering a range of vigour classifications, may be useful alternatives to those currently in use by industry. Significance and impact of the study: The study has shown that the performance of scion varieties, and to a lesser degree the fruit composition, is dependent on rootstock choice. The inherent vigour of the scion variety must be considered in rootstock selection. Furthermore, individual scion/rootstock combinations may require specific irrigation, pruning or canopy management to achieve vine balance and optimise fruit and wine composition.},

	abstract = {The grapevine phenology is dependent on several factors, such as genetics, soil characteristics, climate conditions, pests and diseases and vineyard cultural practices. Among these, grafting may have an effect on the scion behavior due to the influence of the rootstock. Therefore, an experiment was carried out for two years to determine the effect of rootstocks on Cabernet Sauvignon (CS) grapevine phenology, chilling and heat requirements. Treatments consisted of vines grafted on the rootstocks Rupestris du Lot, 101-14 Mgt, 3309 C, 420A Mgt, 5BB K, 161-49 C, SO4, Solferino, 1103 P, 99 R, 110 R, Gravesac, Fercal, Dogridge and Isabel. Budbreak and flowering of the vines, veraison and maturity of the grapes were the phenological stages evaluated, determining the dates of each stage and the number of days between them. The chilling hours (Tbase= 10 degrees C) for budbreak and the heat summation required to ripen the grapes were also determined. The results showed that the dates of each phenological stage varied according to the year and the rootstock. The average of two years showed that CS/3309 C, CS/161-49 C and CS/101-14 Mgt sprouted earlier and CS/Dogridge later. Grape maturity was earlier on seven CS/rootstocks, where CS/101-14 Mgt and CS/Rupestiis du Lot ripened first and CS/Isabel, CS/5BB K and CS/SO4 later. The average intervals between the stages of CS/rootstocks were (in days), 46.8 +/- 3.0 (budbreak-flowering), 64.3 +/- 2.1 (flowering-veraison), 54.6 +/- 6.1 (veraison-maturity) and 165.7 +/- 7.4 (budbreak-maturity). In 1998, 615.9 +/- 8.0 chill hours were needed to achieve 50\% budbreak and in 1999, 870.6 +/- 6.5 chill hours. where CS/Dogridge required the highest chilling to break dormancy. In order to ripen the grapes, the heat requirement from budbreak to maturity was 1573.4 +/- 43.0 degrees C in 1998/1999 and 1599.4 +/- 25.5 degrees C in 1999/2000, and the juice total soluble solids values were 19.1 and 18.1 degrees Brix, respectively. Although the heat summation of the second cycle was 1.65\% higher, the total soluble solids were lower due to the rainfall that was much higher during its grape ripening period.},

One of the main causes of GTDs infection occur during nursery plant production processes. The phytosanitary status was determined for 150 young grapevine plants (two varieties grafted onto different rootstocks) that were produced in three European nurseries. Some plants were analyzed upon submission, while others were assessed after up to 12 months growth in a greenhouse. Fungal species associated with GTDs were identified and characterized from the scions, graft unions, rootstocks, or roots. A total of 449 fungal isolates associated with GTDs were obtained, and 20 species were identified by morphological characteristics and DNA analyses. Five species were involved in Botryosphaeria dieback, six in black foot disease, six in Diaporthe dieback, and three in Petri disease. Incidence of GTDs on grapevine plants was between 81 and 100\%, with different diseases varying between rootstocks and grapevine varieties. Isolates of other fungal genera not involved in the GTD complex were also detected, including Colletotrichum, Fusarium, and Rhizoctonia. The high presence of GTDs during nursery production of grapevine plants raises the need to implement effective control methods that could prevent the spread of these diseases to vineyards.},

	abstract = {A protocol is offered as a guideline for managers of rootstock mother grapevines, and as a potential research framework for to reduce infections by Grapevine Trunk Disease (GTD) pathogens in rootstock mother vines and cuttings. Latent infections by GTD pathogens in rootstock cuttings are a major source of the pathogens in grafted nursery vines and subsequently in new vineyards. The many pruning cuts made at the crowns of mother vines predispose them to infection which is transmitted to the new shoots via the xylem. Direct penetration by epiphytic inoculum on the bark of the shoots / canes can also occur. Mother vines with unprotected pruning wounds are typically heavily infected, particularly if they are not trellised. Availability of pruning wound treatments is limited in many countries. The spread of GTD pathogen inoculum can be reduced by avoiding sprinkler and flood irrigation, by trellising mother vines so that canopies are off the soil, and by spraying fungicides or painting wounds immediately after canes are harvested. Frequent trunk renewal aids in reducing inoculum. Cuts should be made to retain long internodes on the mother vines, cuttings should not contact the soil and pruning debris should be promptly destroyed. Cutting implements should be disinfested regularly and cuttings should be dipped in a registered fungicide or sterilant. Soaking cuttings increases fungal populations in the basal wounds and softens the bark, favouring penetration by pathogen inoculum. Dormant bench grafting in nurseries produces more GTD-symptomatic vines than field chip budding, so improved management for rootstock mother vines is more important where dormant cuttings are bench grafted. GTD epidemiology in source blocks is summarised, and best practice protocols for mother vine management and pre-grafting stages of propagation are suggested. Similar principles could be applied to scion mother vine management.},

At the warmer site in Everson, WA, rootstocks had no effect on final juice harvest metrics measured by soluble solids, titratable acidity (TA), and pH. At the cooler site in Mount Vernon, WA, the use of rootstocks did not always influence soluble solids or pH but did reduce final harvest TA, a desired effect for the region that is typified by low sugar-high TA wines.

	abstract = {Global warming, altering the physiology and irrigation demand of grapevines, has already been perceived in certain premium viticulture regions across the world. Selection of proper rootstocks for especially new cultivars has vital role for asustainable viticulture under water-deficit conditions. The grapevine cultivar `Michele Palieri' has been finding a good reception on the global markets. The objective of this study was to determine the response of `Michele Palieri' cultivar to deficit irrigation using different rootstocks with distinct genetic origins. Two irrigation regimes (Full Irrigation [FI] and Deficit Irrigation [DI]) were applied to the vines of different grafting combinations of `Michele Palieri' with Kober 5 BB, Richter 99, Richter 110, 140 Ruggeri, 44-53 Malegue or grown on own roots. Two years old vines were cultivated in 60L pots containing sterile peat under controlled glasshouse conditions. Irrigations were regulated according to soil water matric potential (m) levels using tensiometers. The volume of the irrigation water that has to be applied to attain 100\% field capacity was performed as FI, while 50\% of FI was considered as DI. The water was transported directly into the pots by micro-irrigation systems consisting of individual spaghetti tubes. The vines of DI treatment showed visible symptoms of mild water stress (e.g., loss of turgor in shoot tips), but no defoliation or leaf necrosis occurred. DI treatment reduced the gs of `Michele Palieri' scion cultivar in varying levels depending on the rootstock. DI treatment also affected vegetative growth of the scion cultivar in different levels. For example, the greatest decrease (26.7\%) in shoot length resulting from DI was determined in `Michele Palieri'/5 BB grapevines, followed by own rooted vines (13.1\%), while the lowest change (2.4\%) was found in vines grafted on 110R. Overall findings of this study imply that the rootstocks originating from V. berlandiery x V. rupestris hybrids (110R, 99R, 140Ru and 44-53M) better performed in a similar genetic aptitude under deficit irrigation regime while the rootstock 5 BB (V. berlandiery x V.rupestris) showed more susceptible responses. On the other hand, the general response of own rooted vines were better than those grafted on 5 BB. Therefore, the use of one of V. berlandiery x V. rupestris hybrids may be abetter choice for viticulture under semiarid regions.},

However, kinetic parameters related to nutrient uptake efficiency are usually not considered, such as those of nitrate (NO3) and ammonium (NH4+). N is the nutrient that most impacts growth and yield. The objective of this study was to show the importance of the kinetic parameters of NO3- and NH4+ uptake as additional criteria for selecting peach rootstocks. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse. Three rootstock ('AldrighP, `Tsukubar and `Clone 15') were grown for 30 days in a pot containing 0.1 mol L-1 CaSO4 solution to reduce internal reserves of N. Afterwards, the plants were placed in Hoagland nutrient solution, where periodic collections of the nutrient solution were carried out for three days and the concentrations of NO3- and NH4 were determined. After the third day of collecting the solution, the plants were collected and then separated into leaves, roots and stems. Dry matter and total N content were assessed. The kinetic parameters related to NO3- and NH4+ uptake (maximum uptake rate - V-max, affinity constant - K-max Minimum concentration - C-max, Influx - I) were calculated using Cindtica software. The most efficient rootstock for NO3- and NH4+ uptake was `Tsukubar, as it showed the lowest values of C-max and K. and the highest values of V-max and I-max for NO3- and NH4+. NO3- uptake in `Tsukubal' and `Aldrighr showed a two-phase uptake pattern, suggesting the presence of low and high affinity transport systems. On the other hand, NH4+ uptake in the three cultivars apparently followed a one-phase uptake pattern, suggesting the presence of a high affinity transport system. The kinetic parameters of NO3- and NH4+ uptake are additional criteria that can be used in selecting peach rootstocks, as they directly influence shoot and root dry matter production and N accumulation in leaves.},

As strigolactones are known to have a role in the regulation of shoot development in response to nutrient availability, their involvement in the control of scion architecture by the rootstock was investigated. Functional characterization of putative grapevine strigolactone biosynthetic genes in Arabidopsis mutants or grapevine cell suspensions showed similar functions to those of Arabidopsis. Both rootstocks produced strigolactone-like compounds; the quantity produced in response to nitrogen treatments differed between the two rootstock genotypes and correlated with the expression of putative strigolactone biosynthetic genes. Exudation of strigolactone-like compounds by both rootstocks was closely related to the developmental pattern of the scion in grafted plants. These results suggest that differential regulation of strigolactone biosynthesis in response to nitrogen availability may contribute to the control of scion development conferred by each rootstock genotype.},

The objective of this work was to determine which functional processes are involved in genotype-specific differences in scion P content by quantifying P uptake, P remobilization from the reserves in the cutting and P allocation within the plant in three grapevine genotypes. Cuttings of two American rootstocks and one European scion variety were grown in sand and irrigated with a nutrient solution containing either high P (0.6 mM) or low P (0 mM). The high P solution was labelled with P-32 throughout the experiment. The grapevine genotypes studied show variation in the inhibition of shoot and root biomass in response to low P supply, and P supply also affected shoot, but not root, P concentrations. Genotype-specific differences in total P content were related to differences in P acquisition and utilization efficiencies (PAE and PUE, respectively). Phosphorus allocation within the plant was not affected by genotype or P supply. The rootstock genotype known to confer high petiole P content in the vineyard was associated with a high PAE under high P, and a high PUE under low P. This suggests that the petiole P concentrations in the vineyard are related to genotype-specific differences in PAE and PUE, and that these traits could be used for rootstock selection programmes in the future.},

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of Lichi16-6 trifoliata (Poncircus trifoliate, LC), Goutoucheng sour orange (Citrus aurantiunt, GT), and Rangpur lime (C. limonia Osbeck, RI) rootstocks on the occurrence of OTO, plant water status, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging capacity of 12-year-old “Hamlin” sweet orange (C. sinensis Osbeck) trees in both 2014 and 2015 cropping seasons. The results showed that “Hamlin” trees grown on RI. maintained higher water potential and relative water content (RWC) in leaves and fruit peels as well as higher transpiration in the morning and afternoon compared with scions grown on the other two rootstocks. This improved water status in the morning resulted in a lower diurnal range of rind oil release pressure (Delta RORP) and the incidence of OTO per tree (IOPT). However, although “Hamlin” trees grown on GT had a significantly higher transpiration in the morning, leaves of “Hamlin” trees grown on GT had the lowest transpiration in the afternoon compared with those grown on the other two rootstocks. This exacerbated water status in the afternoon resulted in higher malondialdehyde and ROS in leaves and severity of OTO per tree (SOPT). In conclusion, the tolerance of “Hamlin” sweet orange grown on three rootstocks to OTO was modulated by plant water balance supply during OTO-sensitive stage. Also, the Delta RORP and ROS scavenging capacity could be selected as indicators to assess IOPT and SOPT, respectively.},

The study was carried out in three vineyards (two planted with cv. Mencia and one with cv. Souson) within the Ribeira Sacra Designation of Origin (NW Spain). Blades and petioles were collected throughout a growth season (2014) and total concentrations of ten essential elements were determined in both tissues. In general, petioles showed greater variability between replicates for P, K, Ca, Mg, and Zn, while N, Fe, Mn, Cu, and B presented greater variability in blades. Differences between consecutive sampling dates suggest that references for flowering were valid until fruit-set. Furthermore, blade and petiole references at the beginning of veraison were valid until the advanced ripening stage for most nutrients, with the exception of N, P, and Zn. The seasonal variation of the concentrations in both tissues confirmed the need for reference values for each phenological stage and tissue.},

We investigated the role of root characteristics, hydraulic conductance and chemical signals (abscisic acid, ABA) in the response of stomatal conductance (g(s)) and transpiration (E) to drought in Cabernet Sauvignon (Vitis vinifera) grafted onto drought-sensitive (Vitis riparia) and drought-tolerant (Vitis berlandieri x Vitis rupestris 11OR) rootstocks. All combinations showed a concomitant reduction in g(s) and E, and an increase in xylem sap ABA concentration during the drought cycle. Cabernet Sauvignon grafted onto 11OR exhibited higher g(s) and E under well-watered and moderate water deficit, but all combinations converged as water deficit increased. These results were integrated into three permutations of a whole-plant transpiration model that couples both chemical (i.e., ABA) and hydraulic signals in the modelling of stomatal control. Model comparisons revealed that both hydraulic and chemical signals were important for rootstock-specific stomatal regulation. Moreover, model parameter comparison and sensitivity analysis highlighted two major parameters differentiating the rootstocks: (i) ABA biosynthetic activity and (ii) the hydraulic conductance between the rhizo-sphere and soil-root interface determined by root system architecture. These differences in root architecture, specifically a higher root length area in 11OR, likely explain its higher E and g(s) observed at low and moderate water deficit.},

Six-year-old trees including four citrus cultivars of `Moro', `Mars', `Salustiana', and `Italian' which were previously grafted on the four different rootstocks including `Yuzu', `Shelmahalleh', `Citromelo', and `Sour orange' were selected as experimental trees. The content of the mentioned flavonoids was investigated in the peel and pulp of the fruits of both scions and rootstocks. The results showed that the measured parameters were significantly influenced by scions, rootstocks, and tissues. Based on the obtained results, it can be suggested that the accumulation of chemicals in citrus fruit depends on genetic and inherent abilities of the scion, more than what was previously believed, while the rootstock can also play an important role in the accumulation of these substances.},

By considering the reduction in necrosis lengths within the scion stem, treatments with P. oligandrum alone showed the greatest efficacy against the two pathogens (overall average efficacy of 48.3\%).

The evaluations were performed over three crop seasons, in a vineyard located in Louveira, SP. Two evaluations were performed in Brazilian traditional season, and one crop pruning was performed in Brazilian summer, called “off-season”. In traditional seasons, the bud fruitfulness was evaluated from the first to fourth bud in 2014 and to the fifth in 2015. In the off-season, bud fruitfulness was evaluated from the fifth to eighth bud. Fruit yield and quality were also evaluated over the three production cycles. Bud fruitfulness of `Niagara Rosada' grafted onto the evaluated rootstocks showed that this characteristic was more affected by the environmental conditions, confirmed due to alteration of bud fruitfulness through production cycles. Additionally, no effect of rootstock was observed on fruit yield, and quality of `Niagara Rosada'. Only isolated variations were detected, and these are not enough to confirm the influence of rootstocks on scion of `Niagara Rosada'. Although no effect of rootstocks on bud fruitfulness, fruit yield and quality has been observed in the evaluated conditions, all rootstocks are recommended to be used in combination with `Niagara Rosada'.},

	abstract = {During five years of observation the effects of different rootstocks combined with `Gruner Veltliner' on a heavy mar soil were investigated. The locally important rootstocks Kober SBB, SO4, Teleki 5C as well as the French rootstock varieties Fercal and Gravesac were used. We gained physiological, phenological and agronomical data, and furthermore experimental wines were vinified and sensorilly evaluated. Whereas the rootstocks Kober 5BB, SO4 and Fercal showed an acceptable performance under the specific conditions, the rootstocks Teleki 5C and Gravesac suffered due to the structure of the soil. It could be registered that Fercal retarded and Gravesac prematured bud break compared to the Berlandieri x Riparia rootstocks. The sensitivity for colure during flowering is enormous in Gravesac and rendered almost yearly especially loose clusters with low yield. The rootstock Teleki 5C even showed a tendency for heavier colure, but in that case due to the favorably changed structure of the grape it could be seen as an improvement. The yield was not essentially diminished. The capacity for mineral uptake from the soil is reduced by Gravesac and the scion `Griiner Veltliner' showed deficiencies of N, K, Ca and P. Finally the color of leaves and frequently appearance of chlorosis confirmed the problems of Gravesac with the soil conditions. On the other hand the viticultural problems were not reflected within the overall wine quality. The low yield allowed higher sugar contents than with other rootstocks, lower acidity and high rating values in an overall evaluation. Despite the agreeable wine quality this rootstock is not recommended due to sensitivity against chlorosis, low yield and high losses of vines. In contrary Fercal could reach a well-balanced production comparable in quality and yield to the already established rootstocks. Only SO4 was more fruitful, but with lower ripeness. Evaluation of wine quality resulted in a middle position within the group of well-known rootstocks with little differences for Fercal.},

Using a cross between two Vitis interspecific hybrid rootstocks, we mapped a dominant quantitative trait locus (QTL) associated with leaf Na+ exclusion (NaE) under salinity stress. The NaE locus encodes six high-affinity potassium transporters (HKT). Transcript profiling and functional characterization in heterologous systems identified VisHKT1; 1 as the best candidate gene for controlling leaf Na+ exclusion. We characterized four proteins encoded by unique VisHKT1; 1 alleles from the parents, and revealed that the dominant HKT variants exhibit greater Na+ conductance with less rectification than the recessive variants. Mutagenesis of VisHKT1; 1 and TaHKT1.5-D from bread wheat, demonstrated that charged amino acid residues in the eighth predicted transmembrane domain of HKT proteins reduces inward Na+ conductance, and causes inward rectification of Na+ transport. The origin of the recessive VisHKT1; 1 alleles was traced to V. champinii and V. rupestris. We propose that the genetic and functional data presented here will assist with breeding Na+-tolerant grapevine rootstocks.},

On veraison, the ABA content in the `5BB(4x)' berries was the highest among the four types of grafted grapevines, and the IAA and tZ content in these berries tended to be higher as well. However, in the vegetative tissues (shoot apex and roots), the ABA content in the two types of `5BB' grapevine was lower than that in the two types of `HF' grapevine.

However, the mechanisms underlying the rootstock control of scion development are still poorly understood. The ability of rootstocks to regulate nitrogen uptake and assimilation may contribute to this control. A split-root system was used to grow heterografted grapevines and to investigate the molecular responses to changes in nitrate availability of two rootstocks known to affect scion growth differently. Transcriptome profiling by RNA sequencing was performed on root samples collected 3 and 24 h after nitrogen supply. The results demonstrated a common response involving nitrogen-related genes, as well as a more pronounced transcriptomic reprogramming in the genotype conferring the lower scion growth. A weighted gene co-expression network analysis allowed the identification of co-regulated gene modules, suggesting a role for nitrate transporter 2 family genes and some transcription factors as main actors controlling this genotype-dependent response to heterogeneous nitrogen supply. The relationship between nitrate, ethylene, and strigolactone hormonal pathways was found to differ between the two genotypes. These findings indicated that the genotypes responded differently to heterogeneous nitrogen availability, and this may contribute to their contrasting effect on scion growth.},

	abstract = {The French-American interspecific hybrid grape cultivar `Chambourcin' (26.205 Joannes-Seyve) was planted in 2004 at Mountain Grove, Mo., on seven different rootstocks (3309C, 101-14 Mgt, 5BB, SO4, 110R, 1103P, Freedom). Own-rooted `Chambourcin' was also grown. The site characteristics are latitude 37 degrees 9' N, longitude 92 degrees 16' W, elevation 442 m, USDA plant hardiness zone 6a, and a Viraton silt loam soil with 2 to 5\% slope. The soil is characterized as acidic, moderately well-drained, and slowly permeable with chert and fragipan in the subsoil. This soil restricts root growth, is prone to drought, and reduces vine vigor. Rootstocks were tested in a replicated trial during the years 2009 to 2013 to improve scion productivity. `Chambourcin' grafted to 3309C, 5BB, and 1103P had significantly higher yield per vine compared to own-rooted. The remaining rootstocks were not significantly different from own-rooted. Vines grafted to 3309C and 1103P had significantly higher pruning weight per vine compared to own-rooted in three years. The remaining rootstocks were not significantly different from own-rooted. Average cluster and berry weights were not significantly affected by rootstocks in all years, but own-rooted vines were significantly lower in some years. Juice soluble solids was significantly higher for own-rooted compared to some rootstocks in two years, a likely result of lower yields on these vines. Juice titratable acidity was not affected by rootstock, and pH was affected one year. Crop load (yield to cane pruning weight ratio) ranged from 12 to 15. Lower crop loads would likely have improved fruit composition. Productivity of `Chambourcin', a cultivar prone to low vigor when grown on a restrictive soil, can be improved when grafted to rootstocks. The rootstocks 3309C, 5BB, and 1103P appeared best.},

	abstract = {In arid regions under irrigation, vineyards often face water deficit and salinity. As these stressors often occur simultaneously, it is difficult to assess their individual relative severity. The aim of this work was to independently study the physiological responses of grapevine to salinity and water deficit, in order to understand and compare their effects. A pot trial was designed, grafting Cabernet Sauvignon onto 1103P and 101-14 Mgt. Three treatments were evaluated: saline irrigation (Salino; 80 mM ClNa and field capacity), water stress (EH; 0,4 faction of soil transpirable water and 2 mM NaCl) and a control (T; without any stress factors, field capacity and 2mM NaCl). After 54 days, Salino showed smaller effect on leaf area (AF) and shoot length than EH. AF diminished 53\% for Salino, while for EH, AF was reduced in a 78\% with respect to T. Shoot length diminished 68\% for Salino and 83\% for EH. Total biomass did not show any difference between both stresses, falling 52\% for both situations. However, regarding the biomass partitioning, Salino had higher canopy dry weight while EH showed higher root dry weight. Midday leaf water potential was -1,3 MPa for Salino and EH and -0,9 MPa for T. Although stomatal conductance was similarly reduced for both stress treatments (-41\% compared to T), with no differences between rootstocks; an interaction was found between the type of stress and rootstock for net photosynthesis. Finally, 1103P showed a higher Na+ exclusion power than 101-14Mgt (accumulating 21\% less Na+ in the plant). Even though the behavior of the Cabernet sauvignon scion was similar for both rootstocks, the higher exculsion that 1103p showed may indicate possible better performances upon salinity.},

In Vitis, it is possible to generate rootstock/scion combinations that produce a desired drought stress effect crucial for high-quality wine production, though the mechanisms for such interactions are complex and poorly understood. The current study was done on vines with an identical scion (Vitis vinifera `Cabernet Sauvignon') grafted on three different rootstocks-either Riparia Gloire, Paulsen 1103 or 420A-in attempt to explain the differences in water status by examining the underlying anatomical constraints and calculated theoretical hydraulic conductivity. There was a significant difference in physiological responses and yield between the grafts. Riparia Gloire grafts had the lowest water potentials and the highest quality grapes, together with low root, scion stem, and branch theoretical hydraulic conductivity. In scions grafted on Riparia Gloire, the annual growth rings were significantly narrower than in the other two grafts, causing a significantly lower theoretical hydraulic conductivity per annual ring. The narrow annual ring size in scion stem was imposed by the morphological constraint of the stem size. In hydraulically inferior Riparia Gloire grafts, the difference was disproportionally large, with a wide scion grafted on a very narrow rootstock, and Paulsen 1103 had the smoothest graft union. Our results indicate that the ability to develop stronger drought stress in Vitis grafts depends on rootstock-imposed morphological restriction of hydraulic conductivity.},

The whole leaf transcriptome of “Gaglioppo” grafted onto five selected rootstocks showed high variability in gene expression. In particular, significant modulation of transcripts linked to primary and secondary metabolism was observed. Interestingly, genes and metabolites involved in defense responses (e.g., stilbenes and defense genes) were strongly activated particularly in the GAG-41B combination, characterized in addition by the down-regulation of abscisic acid (ABA) metabolism. On the contrary, the leaves of “Gaglioppo” grafted onto 1103 Paulsen showed an opposite regulations of those transcripts and metabolites, together with the greater sensitivity to downy mildew in a preliminary in vitro assay.

Grapevine cv. Red Globe grafted onto three rootstocks (Harmony, Saint George and Salt Creek) were studied Structural and physiological parameters were monitored at different phenological stages under optimal production conditions. An outstanding yield increment brought about by the rootstocks Harmony and Salt Creek was correlated with increased individual leaf and specific leaf area, pruning weight (proxy for total leaf area), photosynthesis per unit leaf mass, sugar in leaves and root carbon reserves. In addition, these high yielding rootstocks induced higher contents of light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b protein of photosystem II and total chlorophyll in the leaves of the scion. No correlations of yield with traits involved in water use (relative water content or instantaneous water use efficiency) were observed. The effects of rootstocks on the light capture capacity of the scion directly affected carbon assimilation and storage and, accordingly, yield. Therefore, the identified traits are valuable targets for screening and selecting yield efficient rootstocks for irrigated table grape production in arid zones. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Since the second half of the XIXth century, grapevine has been grown grafted worldwide to cope with Phylloxera. Consequently, the cultivated grapevine is a chimeric plant made from two genotypes which interact together. The result of this interaction must ensure a balanced functioning dedicated to fruit production in terms of quantity and quality. The rootstock acts as an interface between the edaphic environment and the scion, and is an important component of adaptation to environment. The rootstock is responsible for the uptake of water and minerals from the soil, feeding the aerial parts in exchange for a supply of carbon that is stored as reserves, or used to produce nutrients and growth regulators. Many signaling and regulating molecules, such as hormones and nucleic acids, are also exchanged between the two partners. Despite its importance, little is known about the root system and the grafting zone (rootstock-scion interface) in grapevine. Until recently the study of rootstocks received little attention from growers and the scientific community. New challenges, such as climate change, environmental issues, and yield limitations, have brought new light on the “dark side” of the grapevine. This paper reviews the main physiological processes involved in the functioning of roots and the graft interface. Key, challenging scientific issues as well as applied perspectives for the industry will be discussed.},

The experimental design was completely randomized blocks, with 15 treatments, three replicates and ten vines per plot. The results show that all variables evaluated were significantly affected by the year and the rootstock. The CS/Solferino was among other combinations influenced by the year and had higher significant yield/vine. Indeed, it was higher than that CS/Rupestris du Lot, CS/101-14 Mgt., CS/3309 C, CS/5BB K, CS/161-49 C, CS/1103 P. and CS/Isabel. The number of clusters/bud, per burst bud and per vine and the weight of clusters were affected by the rootstock as well. Pruning weight/vine, yield/pruning weight, leaf area/vine, leaf area index and leaf area/fresh fruit weight are variables related to the physiology of grapevine which were also affected by the rootstock. In general, rootstocks had adapted well to the environment where the experiment was carried out, giving vigor and high yield to Cabernet Sauvignon grapevine, which means that they may be used by grape growers in this region. However, the choice of the right rootstock depends on various aspects, such as those related to the soil characteristics, climate conditions, grape varieties, and even clones, and production purposes.},

After the callusing process (heat forcing), the differences in callus development were greater between the years than among rootstocks, which were the most obvious with the wine- grape variety `Furmint' as a scion. In 2005 there were 38\% more grafts with a partial developed callus comparing to 2006, while in this particular year, for most varieties, the average percentage of the first grade grafted vines and the roots dry weight were higher when the `5BB' rootstock was used.

This system remained handmade until the mid-1950s, when emerged the first international certification programs aimed at obtaining mother plants with high viral sanity. The necessity to increase the scale of production on industrial model and plant material production based on minimum morphological standards appeared at the end of the 1960s. Along the 1970s, research unlocked knowledge on semi-automated grafting, process hygiene, use of plant growth regulators and understanding of physiological events of rootstock-scion compatibility, callus formation and rooting. So, until the mid-2000s, certification schemes and propagation processes advanced little in technical standard. However, grapevine growing areas were expanded and demands for plant material increased, and new diseases emerged from contaminated nurseries. These new diseases (new viral complexes, phytoplasmas, bacteria and grapevine trunk diseases) were discovered by high-sensitivity diagnostic methods. Today, there is a new discussion on the nursery segment worldwide. The propagation techniques have been reviewed from the perspective of reducing the incidence of new diseases and minimum physiological damage of nursery plants during the production stages. Therefore, technological innovations regarding equipment, practices and production inputs have been incorporated in new certification schemes. However, despite these advantages, these schemes have become more complex and multidisciplinary than previous ones, bringing difficulties in adaptation of nurserymen.},

Our goal was to investigate drought stress effects on microRNA (miRNA) abundance in a drought-resistant grapevine rootstock, M4 (Vitis vinifera 3Vitis berlandieri), compared with a commercial cultivar, Cabernet Sauvignon, using their autografts and reciprocal grafts. RNA extracted from roots and leaves of droughted and irrigated plants of different graft combinations was used to prepare cDNA libraries for small RNA sequencing and to analyze miRNAs by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Measurements of leaf water potential, leaf gas exchange, and root hydraulic conductance attested that, under irrigation, M4 reduced water loss in comparison with cultivar Cabernet Sauvignon mostly through nonhydraulic, root-specific mechanisms. Under drought, stomatal conductance decreased at similar levels in the two genotypes. Small RNA sequencing allowed the identification of 70 conserved miRNAs and the prediction of 28 novel miRNAs. Different accumulation trends of miRNAs, observed upon drought and in different genotypes and organs, were confirmed by RT-qPCR. Corresponding target transcripts, predicted in silico and validated by RT-qPCR, often showed opposite expression profiles than the related miRNAs. Drought effects on miRNA abundance differed between the two genotypes. Furthermore, the concentration of drought-responsive miRNAs in each genotype was affected by reciprocal grafting, suggesting either themovement of signals inducing miRNA expression in the graft partner or, possibly, miRNA transport between scion and rootstock. These results open new perspectives in the selection of rootstocks for improving grapevine adaptation to drought.},

Matching leaf water potential ((leaf)) and stomatal conductance (g(s)) data were collected from peer-reviewed literature with associated information. The resulting database contained 718 data points from 26 different Vitis vinifera varieties investigated as scions, 15 non-V. vinifera rootstock genotypes and 11 own-rooted V. vinifera varieties. Linearised data were analysed using the univariate general linear model (GLM) with factorial design including biological (scion and rootstock genotypes), methodological and environmental (soil) fixed factors. The first GLM performed on the whole database explained 82.4\% of the variability in data distribution having the rootstock genotype the greatest contribution to variability (19.1\%) followed by the scion genotype (16.2\%). A classification of scions and rootstocks according to their mean predicted g(s) in response to moderate water stress was generated. This model also revealed that g(s) data obtained using a porometer were in average 2.1 times higher than using an infra-red gas analyser. The effect of soil water-holding properties was evaluated in a second analysis on a restricted database and showed a scion-dependant effect, which was dominant over rootstock effect, in predicting g(s) values. Overall the results suggest that a continuum exists in the range of stomatal sensitivities to water stress in V. vinifera, rather than an isohydric-anisohydric dichotomy, that is further enriched by the diversity of scion-rootstock combinations and their interaction with different soils.},

Breeding grapevine for reduced water use, better water extraction and maintained production (i.e., high water use efficiency) is therefore of major interest. Methods and results: This requires a comprehensive knowledge of the physiological impacts of drought on yield and quality. Attention should be paid to those mechanisms involved in the regulation of water status in plant tissues, as it is the primary parameter affected by drought. Transpiration rate, which has a major influence on plant water status, should therefore receive special attention in breeding programs. Beyond scions, the role of rootstocks, which have been largely introduced in vineyards, should be investigated further as it determines water extraction capacity and could modify water balance in grafted plants. Conclusion: Here we review recent advances in the characterization of genetic variability in the control of water use and water status, whether induced by rootstock or scion.

The experimental design was in randomized blocks with 15 treatments, three replicates, 10 vines per plot. The grapes were harvested at maturity for four years, and then crushed for winemaking. Next, the grape musts were centrifuged to separate the solid phase from the liquid phase, which was used for analyses related to sugar, acidity and minerals. The data were submitted to correlation analysis and Principal Component Analysis. The main results from the average of four years show that, in general, the grape musts of the CS/101-14 Mgt., CS/161-49 C, CS/3309 C, CS/Rupestris du Lot and CS/Gravesac combinations had high values of density, total soluble solids, pH and degrees Brix/titratable acidity ratio, and low titratable acidity, which was high with CS/99 R, CS/110 R, CS/Dogridge and CS/1103 P. Potassium had higher concentrations in the grape musts of CS/SO4 and CS/5BB K. Titratable acidity did not correlate with density and total soluble solids, but positively correlated with yield. Density, total soluble solids, and the concentration of potassium were positively correlated with pH.},

A trial was established in 2005 to evaluate the performance of newly introduced rootstocks compared to sour orange, using the sweet orange cultivar `Maltaise demi sanguine' as the grafted scion. The effect of single or mixed viroid infections were monitored over 12 years. Once established, tree growth, cumulative yield, tree performance and fruit quality of `Maltaise sweet orange' were assessed from 2008. Mixed viroid infections caused significant decreases (39 to 60\%) in the canopy volume of `Maltaise' grafted on Carrizo citrange, Swingle citrumelo, Cleopatra mandarin, Rangpur lime, Volkamer lemon and Trifoliate orange. The cumulative yield of trees grafted on'Alemow' (Citrus macrophylla) and inoculated with Hop stunt viroid (HSVd) was 76\% less than the healthy control. Mixed infections caused production decreases of 56\% from trees grafted on Swingle citrumelo and 69\% from those grafeted on Trifoliate orange. When quality parameters of fruit from trees infected with each viroid, and combinations of viroids were compared, no significant differences were recorded.},

Nevertheless, the mechanisms of rootstocks' tolerance to drought are not yet fully understood. The aims of this study were to evaluate the adaptation of Vitis sp. leaf stomata (density and size) to soil water deficit via interaction with different rootstocks known for their drought tolerance characteristics. Greenhouse trials were carried out in controlled ambient conditions. `Pinotage' (Vitis vinifera L.) grafted onto two rootstocks (99Richter and 110Richter) were used. Half of the grapevines were subjected to severe water constraints. The other half were maintained well-watered. The results confirmed that one mechanism of `Pinotage' leaf adaptation to water constraints was structural during leaf growth, with a reduction in pore size to reduce plant water loss. The transpiration rate of leaves was more related to stomatal size than density. Future studies with rootstocks with contrasting vigour inducing capacity and drought tolerance are needed in order to address the rootstock effect on leaf water status related to changes in leaf growth.},

	abstract = {Due to the competition for scarce water resources in the State of California and elsewhere around the world, agriculture needs to become more water use efficient. There are numerous means available to aid in the irrigation of vineyards to minimize applied water amounts and maintain yields of high quality. This paper will review various methods to assess grapevine water status and estimate vineyard evapo-transpiration (ETc) and provide an update with data recently obtained using numerous grape (Vitis vinifera L.) cultivars and V. vinifera scions grafted onto different rootstocks. A review of the use of leaf (Psi(l)), stem (Psi(stem)) and pre-dawn (Psi(PD)) water potentials as a means to assess vine water status will be followed by current research demonstrating that midday Psi(l) is the most convenient and accurate method to use. It will be demonstrated that all grape cultivars identified by many to date as isohydric (such as `Grenache', `Tempranillo' and `Touriga Nacional') responded to water deficits similarly to anisohydric cultivars (such as `Cabernet Sauvignon', `Syrah' and `Montepulciano') when grown in a replicated field trial. Several factors will be discussed as to why cultivars initially categorized as isohydric by others were not found so here. Lastly, the utilization of the amount of shade (percent shaded area) cast on the ground at solar noon (or percent ground cover) provides reliable estimates of a vineyard's seasonal crop coefficients (Kc) using the following equation: K-c = \% shaded area * 0.017. The value of 0.017 has been found in several other studies in which vine ETc was measured with weighing lysimeters in Europe.},

Thermotherapy treatment is an alternative method for eradicating A. vitis from grapevine cuttings but effects of thermotherapy treatments on dormant vine tissue, bud vitality, rooting and shooting of the propagation materials are not yet fully understood. In this research, it is aimed to determine the effects of thermotherapy treatment (Hot water treatment) on callus formation (at the basal part and grafting point), grafted vine quality (shoot length, shoot width, root number, shooting and rooting development, fresh and dry weight of shoots and roots) and final take in the grafted vine production. Experiment was conducted in the nursery of Manisa Viticultural Research Institute. Rootstocks (Kober 5BB, Couderc 1613 and 41B) and scions (Sultan 7 and Manisa sultani) were hot-water treated at 50 degrees C for 30 minutes which is the most common technique against Agrobacterium vitis. After thermotherapy treatment, all rootstocks were grafted with Sultan 7 and Manisa sultanivarieties. They were kept for 22 days in callusing room for callus development and then they were planted in polyethlyene bags for rooting. At the end of the study, significant treatment x rootstock interaction were observed for the final take of Sultan 7 variety. Thermotherapy treated of 1613C/Sultan 7 combinations had more final take than the control (untreated) group. For instance, hot water treated cuttings of 1613C/Sultan 7 combinations had 75\% final take while the control group had the 70\%. Also there were not observed any adverse effects of HWT on bud and tissue vitality.},

Resveratrol has been detected in several grape organs, but the highest concentrations occur in cane and in root. Grafts used in viticulture have genetically different root and shoot systems. HPLC-DAD method was used to determine the trans-resveratrol content of the ethanolic extracts of grape canes and roots. Trans-resveratrol contents of the roots ranged from 9.3 to 219.1 mg/kg fresh weight and of the canes from 6.7 to 207.9 mg/kg fresh weight. The concentration of trans-resveratrol was affected mainly by the year in both cases of the scion varieties and we observed significant differences between scion -rootstock combinations (p{\textless}0.05) under the same cropping conditions. Consequently, it was found that grape canes and roots vary considerably with respect to trans-resveratrol contents depending on the year.

The identification and characterization of natural sources of resistance are important steps to develop RKN control strategies. In woody crops, resistant rootstocks genetically different from the scion of agronomical interest may be engineered. We describe herein the interactions between RKNs and different woody crops, and highlight the plant species in which resistance and corresponding resistance (R) genes have been discovered. Even though grapevine and, to a lesser extent, coffee have a history of rootstock selection for RKN resistance, few cases of resistance have been documented. By contrast, in Prunus, R genes with different spectra have been mapped in plums, peach and almond and can be pyramided for durable resistance in interspecific rootstocks. We particularly discuss here the Ma Toll/interleukin-1 receptor-like-nucleotide binding-leucine-rich repeat gene from Myrobalan plum, one of the longest plant R genes cloned to date, due to its unique biological and structural properties.

The 4 rooststock/scion combinations were fertilized with 3 different levels of nitrogen after fruit set. Both in 2013 and 2014, N supply increased N uptake by the plants, and N content both in vegetative and reproductory organs. Rootstock, variety and year affected berry weight at harvest, while nitrogen did not affect significantly this parameter. Grafting on RGM consistently increased berry weight compared to 110R. PN consistently produced bigger berries than CS. CS berries were heavier in 2014 than in 2013, but the year effect was less marked for PN berries. The berries were collected between veraison and maturity, separated in skin and pulp, and their content was analyzed by conventional analytical procedures and untargeted metabolomics. For anthocyanins, the relative quantitation was fairly comparable with both LC-MS determination and HPLC-DAD, which is a fully quantitative technique. The data show complex responses of the metabolite content (sugars, organic acids, amino acids, anthocyanins, flavonols, flavan-3-ols/procyanidins, stilbenes, hydroxycinnamic, and hydroxybenzoic acids) that depend on the rootstock, the scion, the vintage, the nitrogen level, the berry compartment.

In part through rootstocks and hybrid scions bred from North American Vitis species, cultivated grapevines can thrive in a variety of environments. However, relatively little is known about the range of climatic conditions under which natural populations of native North American Vitis species occur. In this study, we use geographic information system data to describe the climatic niches of 13 North American Vitis species that are distributed east of the Rocky Mountains and to compare climatic niches in a phylogenetic context. We extracted bioclimatic data from thousands of locality points and performed univariate and multivariate statistical analyses for each Vitis species. We then used these data to determine if phylogenetic relatedness was associated with similarities or differences in climatic niches. Finally, we performed Maxent modeling and multivariate environmental similarity surfaces analysis to identify suitable climate space for each species throughout the United States. Our results indicate Vitis species occur under a wide range of climatic conditions, including warm and wet (V. shuttleworthii), warm and dry (V. mustangensis), cold and wet (V. labrusca), and cold and dry (V. riparia) climates. Some clades within Vitis exhibit similarities in their climatic niches (niche conservatism), while others include species with notably different climatic niches (niche divergence). Additionally, we identify novel geographic locations where some species could potentially flourish. These data provide valuable insights into the abiotic environments occupied by natural populations of North American grapevines and may be useful in the development of rootstock genotypes to suit specific climates now and in the future.},

However, markets often dictate specific grape varieties that can be grown and sold. Thus growers are increasingly interested in conferring particular traits of interest (e.g., drought tolerance) through grafting onto rootstocks. A major goal is to develop rootstocks that can influence scion growth and productivity under drought; particularly those that can increase water conservation through reducing the need for irrigation while ameliorating negative impacts on yields. Growers and scientists recognize that rootstocks have a profound influence on vine physiology (e.g., stomatal conductance, photosynthesis, water status), productivity (e.g., growth, fruit yields, fruit composition), and drought resistance. The challenge is to better understand the exact mechanisms through which rootstocks manifest these effects and thus build the knowledge necessary to drive the development of rootstocks with predictable effects on the scion. The aim of this review is to explore our current understanding of the mechanisms by which grapevine rootstocks influence scion growth and stress response; specifically focused on the integration of vine growth and productivity under water deficit.},

A two year study was carried out in pots to assess performances of the two new M1 and M3 rootstocks vs. those of the commercial rootstocks 1103P and 101-14. Potted vines of M1, M3, 1103P and 101-14 rootstocks were grown in a calcareous and non calcareous soil and for two consecutive seasons subjected to three N supply levels at 0, 2 and 4g of N per pot. Vegetative growth, leaf gas exchange, leaf greenness index (GI) and leaf blade nutrition were assessed. M1 and 1103P were the least vigorous genotypes in terms of total pruning weight; M1 also manifested a stronger apical dominance. Both M rootstocks and 101-14 showed increased leaf WUE at both N supply levels which was due to ability to maintain, at increasing N supply, similar leaf assimilation rates while significantly reducing leaf transpiration. Common tendency of any rootstocks was that increasing N supply corresponded to lowered leaf concentration of K, P, Mg and B. M1 was able to combine a series of desirable features including lower vigor, strong apical dominance, higher WUE at increasing N supply and quite well balanced leaf nutritional pattern. In the present trial M3 did not have the expected devigorating effect. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Table grapes are one of the most productive and economically relevant fruit crops worldwide. Table grape production characterizes by high water productivity but also by an intensive use of water, which puts pressure on local/regional water resources, particularly in dry regions (e.g. South Mediterranean, Northeast and Southeast of Brazil). Climate change and scarcer water resources make the problem more severe in those areas. Meanwhile, consumer's demand for quality and sustainable production is increasing and environmental issues are becoming critical for competiveness. In this context, table grape “industry” needs solutions to promote water savings, sustain yield, quality and profit. Deficit irrigation emerged as a tool to mitigate the negative impact of drought on yield and quality and to save water in modern irrigated viticulture. Our aim is to describe the potential benefits of deficit irrigation in table grape production namely in what concerns water savings and berry quality. Previous literature shows that the effect of deficit irrigation on water savings varies with the genotype (scion and rootstock), the environmental conditions as well as the adopted agronomic strategies. This paper provides a comprehensive and up-to-date overview on the eco-physiological basis of deficit irrigation strategies and their role on growth, yield and berry quality (biophysical and biochemical) in table grape. Complementary crop management strategies to guarantee a more sustainable use of water (e.g. higher water use efficiency), improved berry quality and smaller environmental impact of table grape production are presented and discussed.},

	abstract = {Selection of a suitable rootstock lays the foundation for meeting vineyard, grape and wine objectives. Tolerance to biotic and abiotic conditions is a determining factor. Despite the significance of the grapevine root system in vegetative and reproductive growth as well as grape and wine composition and quality, root behaviour under an array of very complex and integrated environmental impacting factors is largely unknown and research in this regard is surprisingly limited. In this paper, a compilation of some of the research done over many years on root system behaviour is presented. Various aspects of the interaction between the root system and the complex natural environment in which it grows as well as commonly known viticulture practices are discussed. Results obtained under controlled and field conditions are shown. Physical and chemical properties and pre-establishment preparation of the soil have defining effects on metabolic behaviour and spatial distribution (horizontally and vertically) of roots. Alleviation of soil impediments to root penetration provides the best possible basis for above-ground growth. The health status of plant material, genetic characteristics and grafting and nursery processes have a steering impact on the ability of the root system to perform within biotic and abiotic constraints of the soil environment to such an extent that expectations in terms of growth, yield and grape quality of the scion are met. Agronomic practices exert a further tailoring impact on root system performance and support to above-ground growth. The study of only above-ground factors is clearly not sufficient to explain vineyard behaviour. Intensified inter-disciplinary research efforts are required in our quest to understand scion-root system inter-relationships and to control scion behaviour in order to facilitate greater sustainability in grape and wine production.},

	abstract = {Grapevine root system structure and development is dependent on both environmental and genetic factors like most of the woody perennial plants. Vineyard established with grafts has two genetic factors the rootstock and scion. In our study the effect of the rootstock-scion interactions on root system development were examined with two methods, with soil wall profile and with minirhizotron root monitoring system. Number of roots was counted on soil wall profile according to their size and soil depth for 6 rootstocks (Teleki 5C, Teleki 8B, TK 5BB, Ruggeri 140, Fercal and Georgikon 28) and 3 scion cultivars ('Italian Riesling', `Vinitor', `Pelso'). The vineyard was established in 1992, data were collected 18 years later. A second experiment was set it up in 2013 with 9-year-old `Cabernet Sauvignon' plantation established on 5 rootstocks (Teleki 5C, TK 5BB, TF SO4, Fercal, Georgikon 28). Root development was recorded by a minirhizotron camera system at two weeks interval. Data were analyzed by RootSnap softwer. The number and size of roots differed according to the rootstock-scion combinations. Ratio of fine to larger roots ({\textless} 2 mm/{\textgreater}2 mm) varied between 0.55 and 6.5, what is suggested ineffective to very effective root system of the combinations, respectively. It was observed that root growth has started later than bud break in 2013. Previous findings, that early shoot development “financed” from the reserves of woody part of the grape stock is strengthened by our results. Root development varied between row sides. Fercal developed less roots on the eastern side of the row while T5C, TK5BB, TFSO4, Georgikon28 developed larger root system on the west side of the rows. We conclude that root system development is affected by soil physical and chemical properties, but differences according to the rootstock-scion combinations on similar types of soil exist.},

Vegetative growth of grapevine rootstocks and anatomic variables, by the analysis of histological sections performed in the apex, middle, and base portion of the stem, were evaluated. The differences in the vascular system became larger from the apex to the base. The SO4 and Paulsen 1103 genotypes had higher xylem area in the base of the stem, of 2.61 and 2.51 mm(2), respectively, and larger diameter of vessels, of 45.8 and 47.2 mu m, respectively, in comparison to 101-14 MGT that showed 1.60 mm(2) for xylem and 34.1 mu m for vessel diameter. Modifications also occurred for the frequency of vessels. The xylem area, diameter, and frequency of vessels are related to rootstock vegetative growth. Vascularization pattern changes may be a criterion for the choice of rootstocks, due to their effect on the physiological processes.},

	abstract = {The citrus disease huanglongbing (HLB) has become endemic in Florida, with estimates that greater than 80\% of citrus trees are currently infected. Although there are no commercial citrus varieties with strong HLB resistance, some field tolerance has been observed in trees exposed to the disease after they were mature. There is great urgency to identify citrus which may permit `economic citrus production where HLB is endemic. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess field tolerance to HLB. To expedite the trial due to urgency, nursery trees were purchased on rootstock varieties as available. The trial included the following unbalanced scion/rootstock combinations: `Hamlin/Kinkoji', `Hamlin/Cleopatra', `Temple/Cleopatra', `Fallglo/Kinkojr, `Sugar Belle/Sour Orange', `Tango/Kuharske', and `Ruby Red/Kinkoji', with most comparisons based solely on scion/rootstock combinations. A randomized complete block experiment was established at Fort Pierce, FL, in Sept. 2010. All trees exhibited symptoms of HLB and tested positive for the Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas) bacterium by Oct. 2012, with similar titers [directly assessed as cycle threshold (Ct) using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)] measured for all scion/rootstocks at most sample dates, but early titer development in `Ruby Red/Kinkoji' was significantly lower than several other scion/rootstocks. Across all time -points, `Fallglo/Kinkoy had the lowest rating of distinctive HLB mottling and `Ruby Red/Kinkoji' had the highest rating, but `SugarBelle/Sour Orange' had the highest percentage of leaves affected. After 5 years, `SugarBelle/Sour Orange' and `Tango/Kuharske' had the greatest overall increase in trunk diameter, and were among the healthiest in overall appearance. In Oct. 2015, `SugarBelle/Sour Orange' and `Tango/Kuharske' trees had significantly greater fruit load (80-88 fruit/tree) followed by `Temple/Cleopatra' and `Fallglo/Kinkojr (31-35 fruit/tree) while `Hamlin/Kinkoji', `Hamlin/Cleopatra', and `Ruby Red/Kinkoji' produced less than 20 fruit per tree. Despite becoming infected by CLas in less than 2 years after planting, the trees continued to grow and all scion/rootstocks displayed increasing fruit production, although very low in `Hamlin/Kinkoji', `Hamlin/Cleopatra', and `Ruby Red/Kinkoji'. Growth and fruit production in the highest performing scion/rootstocks were likely less than would be expected for healthy trees, but these results are promising, with markedly better response of some scion/rootstocks with mandarin hybrid scions compared with trees with sweet orange or grapefruit scions. Larger fully replicated trials are underway. It is noteworthy that the most pronounced HLB symptoms and higher early pathogen titer, which are the two criteria most widely used in assessing HLB resistance, were not associated with the lowest growth and cropping, and focus on early symptomatic traits when screening for resistance may obscure important disease tolerance.},

In a second step, the `Sangiovese'-grafted cuttings that performed best were tested for vigour and resistance to high concentration of active limestone in comparison with 7 commercial stocks. The 26 best-performing grafted accessions, together with the 7 commercial stocks grafted with `Sangiovese', were planted in field to test the long-term induced effects on scion. This trial resulted in the selection of two stocks bred by self-fertilisation with `Binova', a hermaphrodite flower-bud mutation of `SO4'.

	abstract = {Grapevines were propagated from cuttings up until the late 19th century when the soil-borne aphid phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae [Fitch]) destroyed Vitis vinifera L. vines grown on their own roots. The damaging import of grape phylloxera to France in 1868 led to extensive international research and collaboration to save European viticulture. Numerous growers, breeders and scientists played important roles in the historic campaign against the grape phylloxera and in finding the solution to this problem, which ultimately lay in grafting European vines on American rootstocks. Nowadays, more than 80\% of the vineyards worldwide use grafted plants: a scion of V. vinifera grafted onto a rootstock of single American Vitis species or interspecific hybrids of Vitis species that combine desirable features of their parentage. The majority of rootstocks used today were bred at the end of the 19th century or at the turn of the 20th century. They are mainly hybrids of four species: V. berlandieri, V. riparia, V. rupestris and V. vinifera, but secondary species have also been used. In addition to phylloxera, rootstocks contribute to the control of other soilborne pests such as nematodes and to various abiotic constraints such as drought, salinity, limestone and mineral nutrition problems. They also strongly interact with scion genotypes and modify whole plant development, biomass accumulation and repartition, and phenology. In the context of climate change, they may be considered as a key element of adaptation. Rootstock breeding programs in the main grape growing countries around the world aim to improve pest resistance and adaptation to abiotic stresses. This article will give an overview of the history of rootstock use in the world, a brief description of the main rootstocks cultivated and some details on current breeding programs.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the rootstock-scion interaction on the vegetative growth of Vitis vinifera L., with a focus on the vascular system. We investigated the rootstock genotypes 1103 Paulsen (Vitis berlandieri Planch. x Vitis rupestris Scheele), 101-14 Mgt (Vitis riparia Michx. x V. rupestris), and SO4 (V. berlandieri x V. riparia) grafted on the Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot grapevine varieties. We evaluated vegetative growth variables and performed an image analysis of the vascular system by quantifying the xylem and vessels (diameter, total number, density, and frequency) in different portions (apical, median, and basal) of the scion stem. The rootstock-scion interaction caused differences in vegetative growth and was associated with differences in the vascular system. The vegetative growth of the Cabernet Sauvignon on 1103 Paulsen and Merlot on SO4 combinations was greater than the growths of either variety grafted on 101-14 Mgt. The more vigorous rootstock-scion combinations had vessels with greater mean diameters, xylem areas, and proportion of vessels with diameters greater than 50 mu m. Vines grafted on 101-14 Mgt had a greater proportion of vessels with diameters less than 40 m. The vessel features were altered from the apex to base sections (stem morphology) in all combinations. The physiological interaction between rootstock-scion modified the vascular system in grapevines by altering the xylem vessel.},

Here we explore whether two North American Vitis species and genotypes growing in a common garden can be discriminated with leaf and canopy hyperspectral reflectance factor data (350-2500 nm) using independent t-test and derivative analysis. Foliar properties and spectral indices of the grapevines were evaluated with analysis of the variance (ANOVA) and pair-wise Bonferroni adjusted t-tests. The results showed that V riparia and V rupestris can be distinguished at the leaf level spectra of visible, near-and infrared spectral regions. At the canopy level, genotypes were spectrally discriminated with limited success. The Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) demonstrated the highest potential not only to differentiate two species, but also two genotype pair groups within V rupestris. This finding was also true for the PRI calculated with simulated EO-1 Hyperion data. These capacities to distinguish Vitis species, and to a lesser extent genotypes, using spectral signatures have important applications in remote monitoring of vineyards for plants health and also for locating wild Vitis populations for future crop improvement efforts.},

As an index of compatibility, the callus development and graft success were determined. Dry weight of canes was measured at the end of the growing seasons (2011-2014), while root dry weight only in the first year in the nursery. The grape yield was measured in the first production year. Welschriesling showed good compatibility with all examined rootstocks. More than 85\% of grafts had a complete callus development (8BC rootstock 100\%). The average of graft success in the nursery was 67\%, but the average of 5BB, G251, and G103 was above 80\%. The 6103 rootstock had the highest root dry weight after one season. The dry weight of canes in vineyards was above the average with 5BB, SO4, Binova, Borner, and M V rootstocks. All Georgikon rootstocks had a lower cane dry weight per vine than the others. The highest yields were recorded on SO4, G251, and Borner rootstocks.},

Only, recently, some experiments have been performed to investigate the effects of grafting technique, different soils and rootstocks on scion at transcriptomic level. This work reviews the most relevant findings in this field. These recent advances open a new perspective for a molecular interpretation about the interaction between scion and rootstock as well soil substrates.},

	abstract = {Vine rootstocks are known to have an influence on the vegetative growth and yield of the scion, and also can influence fruit quality in grafted vines with direct effects on the uptake of water and mineral elements, or more indirectly by affecting the balance between fruit and shoot growth. The adaptability of rootstocks to restrictive soil conditions, water and nutrient supply is variable. The impact of different rootstocks on vine performance and scion could be useful information for selecting which rootstock is more suitable for the soils with reduced water availability. This study was conducted in 2013 on three Vitis vinifera L. cultivars ('Summer Royal', `Crimson seedless' and `Autumn Royal') grown in Apulia region (southern Italy) and planted in the same trial site. All vines were grafted onto two rootstocks ('140 Ru' and `34 EM') and subjected to two different irrigation practices under controlled water deficit, in order to study the effect of grafting and water deficit on the whole vine growth and productive development. In particular, vine performance was assessed throughout the season by determining the leaf water potential and, at harvest, the crop yield and both the organoleptic and nutritional (organic acids, carbohydrates, flavonoid and non-flavonoid phenolic compounds) grape quality. From the preliminary findings, we can conclude that physiological responses, such as water relations, of table grape vines could be influenced by the rootstock type, whilst metabolomic characterization of mature grapes suggest that the fruit quality was mainly dependent on the cultivar genotype, even though the different size-controlling rootstocks exerted a relevant influence, especially on vines under restricted water regime.},

	abstract = {Young vine decline, caused by the ground pearl or margarodes (Eurhizococcus brasiliensis) and pathogenic fungi (Cylindrocarpon, Phaeoacremonium and others), is a major problem in many vineyards of Southern Brazil. According to previous studies, the most resistant roostocks were hybrids of tropical species, such as Vitis caribaea (IAC 572, IAC 571-6, IAC 766) and V. cinerea ( IAC 313). A medium resistance level was observed in V. champinii (Dog Ridge) and Muscadinia rotundifolia hybrids (VR 043-43). However, these rootstocks have not being used in grape growing areas of Southern Brazil. An experiment was carried out to evaluate the agronomic characteristics of the scion cultivar Moscato Embrapa grafted on these rootstocks compared to Paulsen 1103 and R99, considered standards for this region. The tropical rootstocks IAC 313, IAC571-6, and IAC 766 induced earlier bud break compared to Paulsen 1103, the opposite of VR043-43 and Dog Ridge. In general aspects, all rootstocks tested can be used for grape production. Even the tropical rootstocks with no winter dormancy behave as normal rootstocks when grafted. IAC 572 has an advantage of not inducing early bud break. However, excessive vigor is the most limiting factor for IAC 572, requiring especial management practices to control vegetative development.},

In this study three different types of rootstocks were tested in loess soil. The research was carried out in the Tokaj wine region, where the loess is one of the most important parent material types. Ruggeri 140, 5C and Fercal rootstock varieties were involved in the experiment with `Furmint' scions. Our hypothesis was that the scion would show better vegetative growth on better rootstock type thus the rootstock quality was measured as the cumulative length of the shoots. Altogether 726 vines were measured and analysed by Generalized Linear Models and GIS methods. The vegetative growth of the shoots is significantly influenced by the rootstock type, but also the surveyed soil variables. Significant relationship between shoot length and the geographic location of the stock was also indicated. Despite this, the effect of rootstock type on shoot growth remained significant even if we used geographic coordinates as random factor. Our results showed that the shoot growth was slightly better in Fercal than Ruggeri 140 or 5C in loess soil This rootstock type was the less affected by the soil variables providing better vegetative growth in all conditions than 5C and Ruggeri 140. The Fercal has been already widely used rootstock type in Tokaj region, however, not only in loess soils.},

Measurements of vine development over a 16-year period showed that rootstock affected early shoot growth, canopy vigour and yield of `Sauvignon Blanc'. For younger vines, seasonal effects on yield per bud across rootstocks dominated rootstock effects, and as vines matured, yield differences among rootstocks became more apparent. Rootstocks also influenced berry size and juice composition at harvest, specifically soluble solids content and pH. Schwarzmann had the highest berry weight and the lowest soluble solids content of all the rootstocks. In the final seven years of the study, 3309 Couderc had the highest juice pH of all the rootstocks. Trends in the performance of scions on different rootstocks only became apparent over time, highlighting the importance of evaluating mature vines.},

We compared the growth of `Fuyu' scions grafted onto three candidate dwarfing rootstocks (SH11, No. 3, and S22) with that on `Aogaki', a standard seedling rootstock, in the field. Six years after planting, the canopy volume on the three dwarfing rootstocks was about 44-54\% of that on the standard rootstock. Similarly, the trunk cross-sectional area of the scions on the dwarfing rootstocks was about 37-60\% of that on `Aogaki'. The total labor time required for the trees on the dwarfing rootstocks was about 1/4-1/2 less than that on `Aogaki'. The fruits produced on S22 and No. 3 rootstocks had lower soluble solids than those on `Aogaki', but those produced on SH11 showed no significant differences in fruit quality (fruit weight, soluble solids, and peel color) from those on `Aogaki'. Trees on S22 produced the lowest yield owing to decreased vigor. Even though trees on `Aogaki' produced the highest yield, those on SH11 had the highest yield efficiency. These results identify SH11 as a promising new rootstock for growing dwarfed `Fuyu' trees because of the scions' high yield efficiency and reduced labor requirements.},

	abstract = {Background: Grafting has been widely practiced for centuries in the propagation and production of many vegetable and fruit species. However, the underlying molecular and genetic mechanisms for how the graft partners interact with each other to produce a successful graft remain largely unknown. We hypothesized that genome-wide mRNA exchanges, which were recently documented in grafted model plant species, are a general phenomenon widely present in grafted plants, including those in vegetable and fruit species, and have specific genotype-and environment-dependent characteristics modulating plant performance. Methods: Using diagnostic SNPs derived from high throughput genome sequencing, we identified and characterized the patterns of genome-wide mRNA exchanges across graft junctions in grafted grapevines grown in the in vitro and field conditions. Results: We identified more than 3000 genes transporting mRNAs across graft junctions. These genes were involved in diverse biological processes and those involved in basic cellular, biosynthetic, catabolic, and metabolic activities, as well as responses to stress and signal transduction, were highly enriched. Field-grown mature grafts had much fewer genes transmitting mRNAs than the in vitro young grafts (987 vs. 2679). These mobile mRNAs could move directionally or bi-directionally between scions and rootstocks. The mRNA transmission rates of these genes were generally low, with 65 \% or more having transmission rates lower than 0.01. Furthermore, genotypes, graft combinations and growth environments had impact on the directions of mRNA movement as well as the numbers and species of mRNAs being exchanged. Moreover, we found evidence for the presences of both passive and selective mechanisms underlying long distance mRNA trafficking in grafted grapevines. Conclusions: We extended the studies of mRNA exchanges in model species to grapevines and demonstrated that genomic-scale mRNA exchange across graft junctions occurred in grapevines in a passive or genotype and environment-dependent manner.},

	abstract = {Drought resistance in a grapevine rootstock was associated with root traits that maintain higher water uptake capacity via less suberization so roots can resupply the shoot with water upon rewatering.Water deficits are known to alter fine root structure and function, but little is known about how these responses contribute to differences in drought resistance across grapevine rootstocks. The ways in which water deficit affects root anatomical and physiological characteristics were studied in two grapevine rootstocks considered as low-medium (101-14Mgt) and highly (110R) drought resistant. Rootstocks were grown under prolonged and repeated drying cycles or frequent watering ('dry' and `wet' treatments, respectively), and the following parameters were evaluated: root osmotic and hydrostatic hydraulic conductivity (Lp (os) and Lp (hyd), respectively), suberization, steady-state root pressure (P (rs)), sap exudation rates, sap osmotic potential, and exosmotic relaxation curves. For both rootstocks, the `dry' treatment reduced fine root Lp, elicited earlier root suberization and higher sap osmotic potential, and generated greater P (rs) after rewatering, but the rootstocks responded differently under these conditions. Lp (os), Lp (hyd), and sap exudation rates were significantly higher in 110R than in 101-14Mgt, regardless of moisture treatment. Under `dry' conditions, 110R maintained a similar Lp (os) and decreased the Lp (hyd) by 36\% compared with `wet' conditions, while both parameters were decreased by at least 50\% for 101-14Mgt under `dry' conditions. Interestingly, build-up of P (rs) in 110R was 34\% lower on average than in 101-14Mgt, suggesting differences in the development of suberized apoplastic barriers between the rootstocks as visualized by analysis of suberization from fluorescence microscopy. Consistent with this pattern, 110R exhibited the greatest exosmotic Lp (os) (i.e. Lp (os) of water flowing from roots to the soil) as determined from relaxation curves under wet conditions, where backflow may have limited its capacity to generate positive xylem pressure. The traits studied here can be used in combination to provide new insights needed for screening drought resistance across grapevine rootstocks.},

	abstract = {Objectives of this study were to quantify starch and soluble sugar concentrations in wine grape (Vitis sp.) scionwood and rootstock material, and to examine relationships between carbohydrate (CHO) metrics and both grafting success and shoot growth. CHOs of three wine grape scionwood cultivars [Merlot and Riesling (Vitis vinifera) and Vidal blanc (Vitis sp.)] harvested from four separate vineyards in the Niagara Peninsula in Ontario were analyzed for starch, total CHOs, total sugars, sucrose, monosaccharides (glucose, fructose), and oligosaccharides (raffinose, stachyose) to determine if CHO differences existed between scionwood cultivar and site, and whether these impacted propagation success when grafted to two different rootstocks ['3309 Couderc' (3309) and `101-14 Millardet et de Grasset' (101-14) (V. riparia x V. rupestris)]. Differences in CHOs existed between vineyards for all cuhivars, and their relationship with propagation success was most evident with `Vidal blanc'. Differences were also observed between sites for some cultivars in terms of grafting success and shoot length of grafted vines. Hot water treatment (HWT) of rootstock increased total sugars, glucose, fructose, and stachyose in 3309, and led to lower starch, total CHOs, and higher sucrose in 101-14 when measured immediately following HWT. At time of grafting, HWT 3309 had lower starch sucrose and raffmose, and higher glucose, fructose, and total sugars compared with non-HWT material, whereas HWT 101-14 contained lower total sugars, raffinose, and sucrose and higher stachyose and glucose. Stachyose, raffmose, sucrose, glucose, fructose, and total sugars in scionwood at time of grafting were correlated with propagation success. However, CHOs at time of scionwood collection in February did not correlate to successful propagation. Relationships between scion viability of all cultivars vs. stachyose and total sugars for both rootstocks suggested a possible relationship between these CHO metrics and propagation success. Differences likewise existed between propagation success on rootstocks 3309 and 101-14 on most occasions with 3309 displaying higher percent scion viability and shoot growth. This may be of particular importance in grafting difficult-to-propagate rootstock cultivars.},

Pecan trees can be infected by the broad host range xylem-limited bacterial pathogen Xylella fastidiosa Wells et al. Infection incites a leaf scorch disease that can cause significant defoliation, reduced tree growth, and lower nut yield. Pecan cultivars are clonally propagated onto rootstocks grown from open-pollinated seed of selected cultivars. X. fastidiosa is transmitted at a high frequency from infected rootstocks into newly developing grafted trees. Rootstocks resistant to infection would be beneficial to pecan nurseries and pecan producers to prevent infection of young trees through grafting, especially when combined with hot-water treatment of scions to eliminate the pathogen. Some common rootstocks were tested for variation in susceptibility to infection using mechanical inoculation with the pathogen. No outstanding level of resistance to infection was detected among the seven rootstocks tested. The rootstocks from `Curtis', `Elliott', and `Riverside' were less susceptible than one standard rootstock in the test ('VC1-68') and less susceptible than highly susceptible `Cape Fear' rootstock. Conversely, the rootstocks from `Apache', `Moore', `Stuart', and `VC1-68' seed had a level of susceptibility to infection comparable to `Cape Fear' and perhaps are not the best choice for rootstocks in geographic areas where X. fastidiosa is prevalent. The results of this research suggest that there is variation in rootstock susceptibility to infection by X fastidiosa. The use of mechanical inoculation may facilitate identification of susceptibility categories of pecan rootstocks to the pecan bacterial leaf scorch pathogen.},

Leaf-feeding populations were chosen from similar ecological habitats, where susceptible rootstock hosts have overtaken scions in abandoned vineyards and produce grape phylloxera populations. To study population structures and test for dominating genotypes, population genetic measures were performed. The genetic diversity detected within the entire set of 315 genotypes was high, with 223 distinct multilocus genotypes (MLGs). Excess of heterozygotes and significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in some populations indicated that the major reproduction mode in these populations is asexual but, sexual reproduction also confirmed by the sign. P (sex) values. The genetic diversity within populations was higher than between populations, although only three overlapping genotypes could be found. MLGs were rare, indicating that no candidate for superclones were detected in the leaf-feeding populations studied.},

The experiments were carried out on ridges with semi-trellis system. The experimental design was randomized blocks, with split plots, with 4 replications and 4 plants per plot. The plots were represented by 9 different combinations. Disease incidence was assessed at two week-interval from September to March (2010/2011, 2011/2012, and 2012/2013). At each sampling, disease was assessed 10 leaves of a same shoot of 6 plants for each cultivar/rootstock combination, for a total of 54 plants. All cultivar-rootstock combinations showed disease symptoms with highest disease incidence coinciding with the greatest amount of precipitation. Based on the relative area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC), the anthracnose incidence showed differences between seasons. Differences between rootstocks and rootstock/cultivar combinations were observed during the first and third season, but there was no consistency between the seasons, indicating that the variation in disease progress could be due to other factors, including as weather conditions, age of the vineyard and inoculum pressure.},

	abstract = {Background and AimsNitrate is a major form of inorganic nitrogen present in cultivated soils; however, information on the mechanisms responsible for uptake of the anion in grapevines is scarce. Methods and ResultsThe response to external nitrate was studied in two clones of the cultivars Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc. Grapevines, own-rooted or grafted on the two rootstocks SO4 and K5BB, were grown in nutrient solution and, after a period of nitrogen (N)-deprivation, exposed to 0.2 or 1mmol/L nitrate. The uptake was an inducible process, operated by high- and low-affinity transport systems. The magnitude and time dependence of the induction varied as a function of the clone. Uptake rate as a function of nitrate external concentration showed a multiphasic pattern. Although nitrate exposure caused a transient up-regulation of nitrate influx transporter genes, a clear correlation with the rise in nitrate uptake could not be found; in contrast, a negative relationship between changes in uptake rates and expression of a nitrate efflux transporter gene was observed. ConclusionsIn the grapevine, the response of low- and high-affinity transport systems to external nitrate was favoured by the presence of the rootstock and also dependent on the characteristics of the scion. Low-affinity uptake and efflux from root cells conceivably play an important role in the overall N-nitrate acquisition. Significance of the StudyThis study shows that activation of mechanisms involved in nitrate uptake in the grapevine is strongly affected by the scion-rootstock combination. Results may be significant for developing agronomic practices and selection programmes related to nitrogen use in the grapevine.},

Plants were grown for 60 days under three levels of nitrate supply. Stem, leaf, trunk and root biomass, and the concentration of 13 macroelements and microelements in roots and leaves were measured. High scion vigour was associated with a high concentration of elements in the leaves. The concentration of some elements in the leaves, such as phosphorus, was affected by the N supply differently in the two scion/rootstock combinations. ConclusionDifferences in rootstock conferred vigour were associated with particular shoot and root ionome profiles, and these responses were dependent on N supply.

Growth parameters were affected by salinity level but not by rootstock, and yield was not affected by either variable. Ruggeri and 216/3 were most effective at limiting uptake and accumulation of Na and Cl in scion petioles, wood, and must. The rootstocks differentially excluded Na and Cl from vines; 216/3 and Ruggeri showed the best performance for Na and Cl, respectively. More Na than Cl accumulated in woody tissue. Mortality rates as high as 17.5\% were found for poor salt-excluding rootstocks irrigated with the highest salinity water. The apparent breakdown of tolerance mechanisms, leading to salt damage and vine mortality, might be due to Na reaching critical levels in woody tissues. The ability to exclude Na and Cl from shoots and fruit was found to (a) increase wine quality by reducing concentrations of salt ions in must and wine, and (b) reduce mortality rates that result from long-term exposure to salt.},

	abstract = {Grapevine is a perennial crop often cultivated by grafting a scion cultivar on a suitable rootstock. Rootstocks influence scions, particularly with regard to water uptake and vigor. Therefore, one of the possibilities to adapt viticulture to the extended drought stress periods is to select rootstocks conferring increased tolerance to drought. However, the molecular mechanisms associated with the ability of rootstock/scion combination to influence grape berry metabolism under drought stress are still poorly understood. The transcriptomic changes induced by drought stress in grape berries (cv. Pinot noir) from vines grafted on either 110R (drought-tolerant) or 125AA (drought-sensitive) rootstock were compared. The experiments were conducted in the vineyard for two years and two grape berry developmental stages (50\% and 100\% veraison). The genome-wide microarray approach showed that water stress strongly impacts gene expression in the berries, through ontology categories that cover cell wall metabolism, primary and secondary metabolism, signaling, stress, and hormones, and that some of these effects strongly depend on the rootstock genotype. Indeed, under drought stress, berries from vines grafted on 110R displayed a different transcriptional response compared to 125AA-concerning genes related to jasmonate (JA), phenylpropanoid metabolism, and pathogenesis-related proteins. The data also suggest a link between JA and secondary metabolism in water-stressed berries. Overall, genes related to secondary metabolism and JA are more induced and/or less repressed by drought stress in the berries grafted on the drought-sensitive rootstock 125AA. These rootstock-dependent gene expression changes are relevant for berry composition and sensory properties.},

To investigate the potential infection pathways of Botryosphaeriaceae species within a rootstock mother vine, three genotyping studies using universally-primed polymerase chain reaction (UP-PCR) were conducted with two Neofusicoccum species, namely N. luteum and N. parvum. The investigations identified genotypes of the fungal isolates in trunk and shoot infections of the same mother vine. Results showed that the trunk and shoot isolates from the same vine were of the same or different genotypes, suggesting multiple infections from different inoculum sources. This study further showed that the Neofusicoccum isolates recovered from the surfaces of the cuttings were of the same or different genotypes from those isolated from adjacent internal tissues, again suggesting multiple sources of external inoculum. Investigations into the spatial distribution of Botryosphaeriaceae fungi within an entire dormant cane also showed that multiple species and genotypes were distributed along the cane but most isolates were sited within the bark, being less frequently in the wood, which suggested that they were latent on surface tissues. Since some adjacent wood and bark infections were caused by the same genotypes, this indicated that wood infection may have originated from the bark. These fungi appear to cause latent infections in the bark of dormant cuttings which are used in plant propagation, thus providing an additional infection pathway for a disease that is known to show obvious symptoms only in older vineyards.},

	abstract = {Grape phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae) feeds exclusively on Vitis species, preferentially on leaves of American Vitis species and roots of European Vitis vinifera. Over the last 15 years, extensive feeding and galling on V. vinifera leaves have been observed in Italy, Brazil, and Peru. In Uruguay, D. vitifoliae infestations on V. vinifera leaves were detected in very high densities. The cause of this unexpected insect behavior is unknown, but possible explanations include selection pressure for more aggressive native strains in the new context of vigorous plants replacing old vineyards, loss of resistance in plants due to improvement programs, or importation of exotic strains of the insect. The aims of this research were to evaluate genetic diversity of leaf-galling populations of Uruguayan phylloxera, to estimate genetic distances among them, and to compare Uruguayan and foreign phylloxera populations (Brazilian, Peruvian, and European). Genetic distances between root and leaf samples from the same plant were also estimated. Four polymorphic microsatellite primers were used in this study. In the analysis of leaf- and root-insect populations from the same plant, different insect genotypes were found on grafted vines, with one genotype on the rootstock and one on the V. vinifera (cultivar scion). For Uruguayan leaf-galling insect populations, the average number of alleles per locus was 4.25. Genetic variance found among individuals within populations was 88\% (SE = 2.298, p {\textless} 0.001), and 12\% between populations (SE = 0.319, p {\textless} 0.001). An F-ST of 0.211 (p {\textless} 0.001) suggests limited genetic flow among populations. Significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium detected for the loci analyzed and the negative F-IS values together suggest that parthenogenesis could be the reproductive mode. Genetic diversity found in this work shows considerable potential for host adaptation to environmental variability.},

	volume = {128},
	abstract = {The citrus disease huanglongbing (HLB) has become endemic in Florida, with estimates that greater than 80\% of citrus trees are currently infected. Although there are no commercial citrus varieties with strong HLB resistance, some field tolerance has been observed in trees exposed to the disease after they were mature. There is great urgency to identify citrus which may permit economic citrus production where HLB is endemic. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess field tolerance to HLB. To expedite the trial due to urgency, nursery trees were purchased on rootstock varieties as available. The trial included the following unbalanced scion/rootstock combinations: `Hamlin/Kinkoji', `Hamlin/Cleopatra', `Temple/Cleopatra', `Fallglo/Kinkoji', `Sugar Belle/Sour Orange', `Tango/Kuharske', and `Ruby Red/Kinkoji', with most comparisons based solely on scion/rootstock combinations. A randomized complete block experiment was established at Fort Pierce, FL, in Sept. 2010. All trees exhibited symptoms of HLB and tested positive for the Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas) bacterium by Oct. 2012, with similar titers [directly assessed as cycle threshold (Ct) using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)] measured for all scion/rootstocks at most sample dates, but early titer development in `Ruby Red/Kinkoji' was significantly lower than several other scion/rootstocks. Across all time-points, `Fallglo/Kinkoji' had the lowest rating of distinctive HLB mottling and `Ruby Red/Kinkoji' had the highest rating, but `SugarBelle/Sour Orange' had the highest percentage of leaves affected. After 5 years, `SugarBelle/Sour Orange' and `Tango/Kuharske' had the greatest overall increase in trunk diameter, and were among the healthiest in overall appearance. In Oct. 2015, `SugarBelle/Sour Orange' and `Tango/Kuharske' trees had significantly greater fruit load (80-88 fruit/tree) followed by `Temple/Cleopatra' and `Fallglo/Kinkoji' (31-35 fruit/tree) while `Hamlin/Kinkoji', `Hamlin/Cleopatra', and `Ruby Red/Kinkoji' produced less than 20 fruit per tree. Despite becoming infected by CLas in less than 2 years after planting, the trees continued to grow and all scion/rootstocks displayed increasing fruit production, although very low in `Hamlin/Kinkoji', `Hamlin/Cleopatra', and `Ruby Red/Kinkoji'. Growth and fruit production in the highest performing scion/rootstocks were likely less than would be expected for healthy trees, but these results are promising, with markedly better response of some scion/rootstocks with mandarin hybrid scions compared with trees with sweet orange or grapefruit scions. Larger fully replicated trials are underway. It is noteworthy that the most pronounced HLB symptoms and higher early pathogen titer, which are the two criteria most widely used in assessing HLB resistance, were not associated with the lowest growth and cropping, and focus on early symptomatic traits when screening for resistance may obscure important disease tolerance.},

	abstract = {Census-based studies document changes in population size of animal species in response to wildfires, but mechanisms involving behavior of individuals and the effects on reproductive success are usually unknown. I developed a conceptual model explaining the persistence of cavity-nesting birds on the landscape after fires depending on carrying capacity (food supply) of the habitat and the philopatry and territoriality of the species. The breeding density, nest site characteristics, and reproductive success of Northern Flickers Colaptes auratus was studied before and after low- to moderate-severity fires on replicated plots. The density and spatial distribution of nests did not change in a consistent way after fires, but the rates of cavity excavation increased and characteristics of nest sites changed as such decay class of the tree. Laying dates were delayed and clutches were smaller in freshly excavated vs. reused cavities on the burned sites. Breeding philopatry caused a shift to older age classes in the population. Depredation of nests by small mammals increased during the first three years after fires, reducing the number of young produced per nest attempt on burned plots. The study shows that, even when fire does not reduce the density of breeding pairs, there may be detrimental effects detected only by monitoring the behavior and reproduction of individuals.},

We compare alternative approaches to estimate Ψmin and assess the corresponding uncertainties and biases; propose statistically robust estimation methods based on extreme value theory (EVT); and assess the implications of our results for the characterization of hydraulic risk. Our results show that current estimates of Ψmin and HSM are biased, as they are strongly affected by sample size. Because sampling effort is generally higher for species living in dry environments, the differences in current Ψmin estimates between these species and those living under milder conditions are partly artifactual. When this bias is corrected using EVT methods, resulting HSM tend to increase substantially with resistance to embolism across species. Although data availability and representativeness remain the main challenges for proper determination of Ψmin , a closer look at Ψ distributions and the use of statistically robust methods to estimate Ψmin opens new ground for characterizing plant hydraulic risks.},

Leaf hydraulic vulnerability was significantly lower in the relatively anisohydric J. monosperma than in the more isohydric P. edulis. In P. edulis, Ψl dropped and stayed below 50\% loss of leaf hydraulic conductance (P₅₀) early in the day during May, August and around midday in September, leading to sustained reductions in Kleaf . In J. monosperma, Ψl dropped below P₅₀ only during August, resulting in the maintenance of Kleaf during much of the growing season. Mean A and gs during September were significantly lower in P. edulis than in J. monosperma. Foliar total NSC was two to three times greater in J. monosperma than in P. edulis in June, August and September. Consistently lower levels of total NSC in P. edulis suggest that its isohydric strategy pushes it towards the exhaustion of carbon reserves during much of the growing season.},

We exposed saplings of 10 temperate tree species differing in shade tolerance to 6\% of ambient sunlight for 3 yr to induce C limitation, and also defoliated one species, Carpinus betulus, in the third season. Growth and NSC concentrations were monitored to determine C allocation. Shade strongly reduced growth, but after an initial two-fold decrease, NSC concentrations of shaded saplings recovered to the level of unshaded saplings by the third season. NSC concentrations were generally more depleted under shade after leaf flush, and following herbivore attacks. Only under shade did artificial defoliation lead to mortality and depleted NSC concentrations in surviving individuals. We conclude that, irrespective of shade tolerance, C storage is maintained under prolonged shading, and thus high NSC concentrations can occur during C limitation. Yet, our results also suggest that decreased NSC concentrations are indicative of C limitation, and that additional leaf loss can lead to lethal C shortage in deep shade.},

We completely darkened and subsequently released seedlings of two deciduous and two evergreen temperate tree species for varying periods. NSCs were measured in all major organs, allowing assessment of whole-seedling NSC balances. NSCs decreased fast in darkness, but seedlings survived species-specific whole-seedling starch concentrations as low as 0.4-0.8\% per dry matter (DM), and sugar (sucrose, glucose and fructose) concentrations as low as 0.5-2.0\% DM. After re-illumination, the refilling of NSC pools began within 3 wk, while the resumption of growth was delayed or restricted. All seedlings had died after 12 wk of darkness, and starch and sugar concentrations in most tissues were lower than 1\% DM.

	abstract = {Nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC) are an important component of the carbon storage pool in trees and commonly used to assess whether tree growth under various conditions is carbon limited. However, we know very little about what causes variation in NSC levels and allocation among trees. While NSCs may accumulate passively when growth is carbon saturated, their storage may be active, competing with growth for carbon. If storage is mostly an active process, trees may maintain high NSC levels at the expense of potential growth, making NSC levels poor indicators of carbon saturated growth. To determine how growth and NSC allocation are related, we compared variation in the seasonal changes in NSC levels (NSC increment) with variation in radial growth in mature, canopy black oaks in the New Jersey Pine Barrens. Using experimental defoliation of saplings in a common garden and mature trees in the field, we also explored whether allocation shifts that favor storage reduce growth. Growth and NSC increment were positively correlated, indicating that storage was active, not the result of carbon-saturated growth. Defoliation reduced sapling growth, but increased the proportion of biomass allocated to NSCs. In adults, defoliation reduced growth for three years. However, while aboveground NSC levels may not have completely recovered by the end of the third year, belowground levels recovered after two years due to greater NSC allocation. Defoliation also changed the relationship between NSC increment and growth in the two years following defoliation, causing a shift in allocation that favored storage. The positive relationship between growth and NSC increment indicated that the allocation shift was not due to sink limitation. We conclude that storage is a high priority in these trees. In addition, carbon limiting events like defoliation can greatly alter carbon allocation by increasing the priority of storage, potentially in response to greater threats of carbon starvation. Our results indicate that carbon limitation to growth may occur not only because of decreased carbon availability but because of allocation shifts that reduce the priority of growth relative to other processes.

	abstract = {Plants operate along a continuum of stringency of regulation of plant water potential from isohydry to anisohydry. However, most metrics and proxies of plant iso/anisohydric behavior have been developed from limited sets of site-specific experiments. Understanding the underlying mechanisms that determine species' operating ranges along this continuum, independent of site and growing conditions, remains challenging. We compiled a global database to assess the global patterns of metrics and proxies of plant iso/anisohydry and then explored some of the underlying functional traits and trade-offs associated with stringency of regulation that determines where species operate along the continuum. Our results showed that arid and semi-arid biomes were associated with greater anisohydry than more mesic biomes, and angiosperms showed marginally greater anisohydry than gymnosperms. Leaf water potential at the turgor loss point (Ψtlp) and wood density were the two most powerful proxies for ranking the degree of plant iso/anisohydry for a wide range of species and biomes. Both of these simple traits can be easily and rapidly determined, and therefore show promise for a priori mapping and understanding of the global distribution pattern of the degree of plant iso/anisohydry. Generally, the most anisohydric species had the most negative values of Ψtlp and highest wood density, greatest resistance to embolism, lowest hydraulic capacitance and lowest leaf-specific hydraulic conductivity of their branches. Wood density in particular appeared to be central to a coordinated series of traits, trade-offs and behaviors along a continuum of iso/anisohydry. Quantification of species' operating ranges along a continuum of iso/anisohydry and identification of associated trade-offs among functional traits may hold promise for mechanistic modeling of species-specific responses to the anticipated more frequent and severe droughts under global climate change scenarios.},

Drought may lead to a decrease in tree growth and to NSC depletion, whereas increased soil moisture in otherwise dry ecosystems may increase growth and NSC concentrations. A long-term (13 yr) irrigation experiment was conducted in a Pinus sylvestris-dominated forest located at the dry margin of the species in southern Switzerland. We measured the relative leaf area, growth, NSCs, needle δ13 C, [N] and [P] in trees on control and irrigated plots. Irrigation resulted in higher growth rates and carbon isotope discrimination, but did not alter NSC levels. Growth and NSC decreased with decreasing leaf area in both treatments, but NSC did not correlate with leaf-level gas exchange indices, such as foliar δ13 C, [N] or [P]. A legacy effect was shown, as trees with initially low leaf area had limited ability to respond to prolonged irrigation. The NSC constancy across treatments provides evidence that carbohydrate storage may stay constant when climate changes are sufficiently slow to allow acclimation. Moreover, we speculate that total leaf area, rather than leaf gas exchange per unit leaf area, drives the variation in whole-tree carbohydrate dynamics in this system.},

	abstract = {PREMISE Understanding plant hydraulic functioning and water balance during drought has become key in predicting species survival and recovery. However, there are few insightful studies that couple physiological and morphological attributes for many ecosystems, such as the vulnerable Tropical Montane Cloud Forests (TMCF). In this study, we evaluated drought resistance and recovery for saplings for five tree species spanning deciduous to evergreen habits from a Mexican TMCF. METHODS In drought simulations, water was withheld until plants reached species-specific P50 or P88 values (pressures required to induce a 50 or 88\% loss in hydraulic conductivity), then they were rewatered. Drought resistance was considered within the isohydric-anisohydric framework and compared to leaf gas exchange, water status, pressure-volume curves, specific leaf area, and stomatal density. RESULTS The TMCF species closed stomata well before significant losses in hydraulic conductivity (isohydric). Yet, despite the coordination of these traits, the traits were not useful for predicting the time needed for the species to reach critical hydraulic thresholds. Instead, maximum photosynthetic rates explained these times, reinforcing the linkage between hydraulic and carbon dynamics. Despite their varying hydraulic conductivities, stomatal responses, and times to hydraulic thresholds, 58 of the 60 study plants recovered after the rewatering. The recovery of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance can be explained by the P50 values and isohydry. CONCLUSIONS This study raises new questions surrounding drought management strategies, recovery processes, and how lethal thresholds are defined. Further studies need to consider the role of water and carbon balance in allowing for both survival and recovery from drought.},

In particular, in situ examinations of carbon starvation and its interactions with and effects on infestation and hydraulic vulnerability are largely lacking. In this study, we conducted a controlled, in situ, repeated defoliation experiment to induce carbon stress in isolated trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) ramets. We monitored leaf morphology, leaves per branch, and multitissue carbohydrate concentrations during canopy defoliation. We examined the subsequent effects of defoliation and defoliation-induced carbon stress on vulnerability to insect/fungus infestation and hydraulic vulnerability the following year. Defoliated ramets flushed multiple canopies, which coincided with moderate drawdown of nonstructural carbohydrate reserves. Infestation frequency greatly increased and hydraulic conductivity decreased 1 year after defoliation. Despite incomplete carbohydrate drawdown from defoliation and relatively rapid carbohydrate recovery, suggesting considerable carbohydrate reserves in aspen, defoliation-induced carbon stress held significant consequences for vulnerability to mortality agents and hydraulic performance. Our results indicate that multiyear consequences of drought via feedbacks are likely important for understanding forests’ responses to drought and climate change over the coming decades.},

The objectives of this study were to form a comprehensive understanding of the drought resistance strategies adopted by Eastern Mediterranean woodland species, and to elaborate specific ecophysiological traits that can explain the observed variation in survival among these species. We examined leaf water potential (𝛹), gas exchange and stem hydraulics during 2-3 years in mature individuals of the key woody species Phillyrea latifolia, Pistacia lentiscus and Quercus calliprinos that co-exist in a dry woodland experiencing 6 rainless summer months. As compared to the other two similarly functioning species, Phillyrea displayed considerably lower 𝛹 (minimum 𝛹 of -8.7 MPa in Phillyrea vs. -4.2 MPa in Pistacia and Quercus), lower 𝛹 at stomatal closure, lower leaf turgor loss point (𝛹TLP), but reduced hydraulic vulnerability and wider safety margins. Notably, Phillyrea allowed 𝛹 to drop below 𝛹TLP under severe drought, whereas the other two species maintained positive turgor. These results indicate that Phillyrea adopted a more anisohydric drought resistance strategy, while Pistacia and Quercus exhibited a more isohydric strategy and probably relied on deeper water reserves. Unlike the two relatively isohydric species, Phillyrea reached complete stomatal closure at the end of the dry summer. Despite assessing a large number of physiological traits, none of them could be directly related to tree mortality. Higher mortality was observed for Quercus than for the other two species, which may result from higher water consumption due to its 2.5-10 times larger crown volume. The observed patterns suggest that similar levels of drought resistance in terms of survival can be achieved via different drought resistance strategies. Conversely, similar resistance strategies in terms of isohydricity can lead to different levels of vulnerability to extreme drought.},

	abstract = {Abstract How the mortality and growth of tree species vary with the iso-anisohydric continuum and xylem vulnerability is still being debated. We conducted a precipitation reduction experiment to create a mild drought condition in a forest in the Baotianman Mountains, China, a sub-humid region. Three main sub-canopy tree species in this region were examined. After rainfall reduction, Lindera obtusiloba showed severe dieback, but two other co-occurring species did not show dieback. The water potential at stomatal closure of Dendrobenthamia japonica, L. obtusiloba and Sorbus alnifolia was −1.70, −2.54 and −3.41 MPa, respectively, whereas the water potential at 88 \% loss in hydraulic conductivity of the three species was −2.31, −2.11 and −7.01 MPa, respectively. Taken together, near-anisohydric L. obtusiloba with vulnerable xylem was highly susceptible to drought dieback. Anisohydric S. alnifolia had the most negative minimum water potential, and its xylem was the most resistant to cavitation. Isohydric D. japonica conserved water by rapidly closing its stomata. Ultimately, the hydraulic safety margin (HSM) of L. obtusiloba was the smallest among the three species, especially in precipitation-reduced plots. In terms of the stomatal safety margin (SSM), L. obtusiloba was negative, while S. alnifolia and D. japonica were positive. Of the two species without dieback, rainfall reduction decreased growth of D. japonica, but did not influence growth of S. Alnifolia; meanwhile, rainfall reduction led to a decrease of non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) in D. japonica, but an increase in S. alnifolia. It is concluded that HSM as well as SSM allow interpreting the sensitivity of the three sub-canopy species to drought. The drought-induced dieback of L. obtusiloba is determined by the interaction of stomatal behaviour and xylem vulnerability, and the species could be sensitive to climate change-caused drought although still in sub-humid areas. The isohydric/anisohydric degree is associated with NSCs status and growth of plants.},

To maintain growth and survival, the resources have to be shared more efficiently, which could result in a trade-off between the different physiological processes of a plant. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of defoliation in carbon allocation of balsam fir [Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.] to test the presence of a trade-off between allocation to growth, carbon storage, and defense. Three defoliation intensities [control (C-trees, 0\% defoliation), moderately (M-trees, 41–60\%), and heavily (H-trees, 61–80\%) defoliated] were selected in order to monitor several variables related to stem growth (wood formation in xylem), carbon storage in stem and needle (non-structural soluble sugars and starch), and defense components in needles (terpenoids compound) from May to October 2011. The concentration of starch was drastically reduced in both wood and leaves of H-trees with a quasi-absence of carbon partitioning to storage in early summer. Fewer kinds of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes were formed with an increasing level of defoliation indicating a lower carbon allocation for the production of defense. The carbon allocation to wood formation gradually reduced at increasing defoliation intensities, with a lower growth rate and fewer tracheids resulting in a reduced carbon sequestration in cell walls. The hypothesis of a trade-off between the allocations to defense components and to non-structural (NCS) and structural (growth) carbon was rejected as most of the measured variables decreased with increasing defoliation. The starch amount was highly indicative of the tree carbon status at different defoliation intensity and future research should focus on the mechanism of starch utilization for survival and growth following an outbreak.},

	abstract = {Abstract Plants that store nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC) may rely on carbon reserves to survive carbon‐limiting stress, assuming that reserves can be mobilized. We asked whether carbon reserves decrease in resource stressed seedlings, and if NSC allocation is related to species' relative stress tolerances. We tested the effects of stress (shade, drought, and defoliation) on NSC in seedlings of five temperate tree species (Acer rubrum Marsh., Betula papyrifera Marsh., Fraxinus americana L ., Quercus rubra L., and Quercus velutina Lam.). In a greenhouse experiment, seedlings were subjected to combinations of shade, drought, and defoliation. We harvested seedlings over 32–97 days and measured biomass and NSC concentrations in stems and roots to estimate depletion rates. For all species and treatments, except for defoliation, seedling growth and NSC accumulation ceased. Shade and drought combined caused total NSC decreases in all species. For shade or drought alone, only some species experienced decreases. Starch followed similar patterns as total NSC, but soluble sugars increased under drought for drought‐tolerant species. These results provide evidence that species deplete stored carbon in response to carbon limiting stress and that species differences in NSC response may be important for understanding carbon depletion as a buffer against shade‐ and drought‐induced mortality.},

	abstract = {Significance Sound knowledge of the limits of tree hydraulic function is crucial to understand drought-induced tree mortality, although the mechanisms are difficult to study in adult trees. We explored the dynamic changes that the tree hydraulic system undergoes during the progression of a severe drought in dying adults of Norway spruce. Xylem pressure and hydraulic conductance showed sudden, nonlinear declines that commenced at surprisingly low levels of xylem embolism and caused a rapid collapse of the tree’s hydraulic system and tree death. These observations provide striking field-based evidence for hydraulic failure in adult conifers that are on the trajectory to drought-induced mortality. The nonlinear temporal dynamic of dehydration suggests a higher mortality risk than previously assumed for this major European tree species. Understanding the vulnerability of trees to drought-induced mortality is key to predicting the fate of forests in a future climate with more frequent and intense droughts, although the underlying mechanisms are difficult to study in adult trees. Here, we explored the dynamic changes of water relations and limits of hydraulic function in dying adults of Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) during the progression of the record-breaking 2018 Central European drought. In trees on the trajectory to drought-induced mortality, we observed rapid, nonlinear declines of xylem pressure that commenced at the early onset of xylem cavitation and caused a complete loss of xylem hydraulic conductance within a very short time. We also observed severe depletions of nonstructural carbohydrates, though carbon starvation could be ruled out as the cause of the observed tree death, as both dying and surviving trees showed these metabolic limitations. Our observations provide striking field-based evidence for fast dehydration and hydraulic collapse as the cause of drought-induced mortality in adult Norway spruce. The nonlinear decline of tree water relations suggests that considering the temporal dynamics of dehydration is critical for predicting tree death. The collapse of the hydraulic system within a short time demonstrates that trees can rapidly be pushed out of the zone of hydraulic safety during the progression of a severe drought. In summary, our findings point toward a higher mortality risk for Norway spruce than previously assumed, which is in line with current reports of unprecedented levels of drought-induced mortality in this major European tree species.},

	abstract = {Trees that grow in urban areas are confronted with a wide variety of stresses that undermine their long-term survival. These include mechanical damage to the crown, root reduction and stem injury, all of which remove significant parts of plant tissues. The single or combined effects of these stresses generate a complex array of growth and ecophysiological responses that are hard to predict. Here we evaluated the effects of different individual and combined damage on the dynamics of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC, low weight sugars plus starch) concentration and new tissue growth (diameter increment) in young trees. We hypothesized that (i) tissue damage will induce larger reductions in diameter growth than in NSC concentrations and (ii) combinations of stress treatments that minimally alter the “functional equilibrium” (e.g., similar reductions of leaf and root area) would have the least impact on NSC concentrations (although not on growth) helping to maintain tree health and integrity. To test these hypotheses, we set up a manipulative field experiment with 10-year-old trees of common urban species (Celtis occidentalis, Fraxinus pennsylvanica, and Tilia cordata). These trees were treated with a complete array of mechanical damage combinations at different levels of intensity (i.e., three levels of defoliation and root reduction, and two levels of stem damage). We found that tree growth declined in relation to the total amount of stress inflicted on the trees, i.e., when the combined highest level of stress was applied, but NSC concentrations were either not affected or, in some cases, increased with an increasing level of stress. We did not find a consistent response in concentration of reserves in relation to the combined stress treatments. Therefore, trees appear to reach a new “functional equilibrium” that allows them to adjust their levels of carbohydrate reserves, especially in stems and roots, to meet their metabolic demand under stressful situations. Our results provide a unique insight into the carbon economy of trees facing multiple urban stress conditions in order to better predict long-term tree performance and vitality.},

	abstract = {Climate change is expected to increase both pest insect damage and the occurrence of severe drought. There is therefore a need to better understand the combined effects of biotic and abiotic damage on tree growth in order to predict the multi-factorial effect of climate change on forest ecosystem productivity. Indeed, the effect of stress interactions on tree growth is an increasingly important topic that greatly lacks experiments and data, and it is unlikely that the impact of combined stresses can be extrapolated from the outcomes of studies that focused on a single stress. We developed an original manipulative study under real field conditions where we applied artificial defoliation and induced water stress on 10-year-old (∼10 m high) maritime pine trees (Pinus pinaster Ait.). Tree response to combined stresses was quantitatively assessed following tree secondary growth and carbohydrate pools. Such a design allowed us to address the crucial question of combined stresses on trees under stand conditions, sharing soil supplies with neighboring trees. Our initial hypotheses were that (i) moderate defoliation can limit the impact of water stress on tree growth through reduced transpiration demand by a tree canopy partly defoliated and that (ii) defoliation results in reduced non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) pools, affecting tree tolerance to drought. Our results showed additive effects of defoliation and water stress on tree growth and contradict our initial hypothesis. Indeed, under stand conditions, we found that partial defoliation does not limit the impact of water stress through reduced transpiration. Our study also highlighted that, even if NSC in all organs were affected by defoliation, tree response to water stress was not triggered. We found that stem NSC were maintained or increased during the entire growing season, supporting literature-based hypotheses such as an active maintenance of the hydraulic system or another limiting resource for tree growth under defoliation. We also observed a significant decrease in root carbohydrates, which suggests a shift in the root carbon balance under defoliation. The decrease in carbohydrate supply under defoliation may not counterbalance the carbon use for mineral and water uptakes or a translocation to other tissues.},

Foliar pathogens of conifers commonly prefer older needles and infection with defoliation that progresses from the bottom crown to the top. The functional role of the lower crown of trees is a key question to address the impact of defoliation caused by foliar pathogens. Methods A 2 year artificial defoliation experiment was performed using two genotypes of grafted Pinus radiata to investigate the effects of lower-crown defoliation on carbon (C) assimilation and allocation. Grafts received one of the following treatments in consecutive years: control–control, control–defoliated, defoliated–control and defoliated–defoliated. Results No upregulation of photosynthesis either biochemically or through stomatal control was observed in response to defoliation. The root:shoot ratio and leaf mass were not affected by any treatment, suggesting prioritization of crown regrowth following defoliation. In genotype B, defoliation appeared to impose C shortage and caused reduced above-ground growth and sugar storage in roots, while in genotype A, neither growth nor storage was altered. Root C storage in genotype B decreased only transiently and recovered over the second growing season. Conclusions In genotype A, the contribution of the lower crown to the whole-tree C uptake appears to be negligible, presumably conferring resilience to foliar pathogens affecting the lower crown. Our results suggest that there is no C limitation after lower-crown defoliation in P. radiata grafts. Further, our findings imply genotype-specific defoliation tolerance in P. radiata.},

	abstract = {An innovative hypothesis to explain the higher carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) storage in woody tissues of winter deciduous species as compared to evergreen species is that these storages reflect an adaptation to tolerate herbivory. Support for this hypothesis has been little when manipulative defoliations were partial and/or applied in a single season. Given that repeated defoliations throughout a single season are common in temperate forests and tend to be more severe in deciduous than in evergreen species, we tested this hypothesis considering complete and recurrent defoliation in two sympatric Nothofagus species with contrasting foliar habit. In the field, we applied three defoliation intensities for 3 years in naturally coexisting juvenile trees of Nothofagus betuloides (evergreen) and Nothofagus pumilio (deciduous). Defoliation intensities included complete defoliation (100\%) twice during the growing season, partial defoliation (50\%) twice during the whole experiment and no defoliation. We evaluated survival, regrowth and C‐ and N‐storage in the leaves, stems and roots of each tree. Complete defoliation caused 100\% mortality in N. betuloides after the first year and no mortality in N. pumilio after 3 years; it induced higher C reductions in N. pumilio roots, supported by greater C‐storage. Partial defoliation caused no interspecific differences in survival, though it produced a stronger decrease in C‐storage in N. betuloides than in N. pumilio. N concentrations in woody tissues were significantly higher in N. pumilio than in N. betuloides, and only in the former did they decrease with the defoliation intensity. Synthesis. We found a potential functional link between leaf habit, defoliation tolerance and C‐ and N‐storage. The deciduous species tolerated complete and recurrent defoliations better than the evergreen species, which was associated with higher C‐ and N‐storage in stems and roots of the former. This link was not detected under partial defoliation. We suggest that the higher C‐ and N‐storage in the woody tissues of deciduous species as compared to evergreen species is an adaptation to tolerate complete and recurrent defoliations under which temperate winter deciduous species may have evolved.},

	abstract = {Plant resistance to drought has long been thought to be associated with the ability to maintain transpiration and photosynthesis longer during drought, through the opening of stomata. This premise is at the root of most current framework used to assess drought impacts on land plants in vegetation models. We examined this premise by coupling a meta-analysis of functional traits of stomatal response to drought (i.e. the water potential causing stomatal closure, Ψclose) and embolism resistance (the water potential at the onset of embolism formation, Ψ12), with simulations from a soil-plant hydraulic model. We found that Ψclose and Ψ12 were equal (isometric) only for a restricted number of species, but as Ψ12 decreases, the departure from isometry increases, with stomatal closure occurring far before embolism occurs. For the most drought resistant species (Ψ12{\textless}-4.2 MPa), Ψclose was remarkably independent of embolism resistance and remained above −4.5 MPa, suggesting the existence of a restrictive boundary by which stomata closure must occur. This pattern was supported by model simulations. Indeed, coordinated decrease in both Ψclose and Ψ12 leads to unsuspected accelerated death under drought for embolism resistant species, in contradiction with observations from drought mortality experiments. Overall our results highlight that most species have similarity in stomatal behavior, and are highly conservative in terms of their water use during drought. The modelling framework presented here provides a baseline to simulate the temporal dynamic leading to mortality under drought by accounting for multiple, measurable traits.},

	abstract = {Considerable evidences highlight the occurrence of increasing widespread tree mortality as a result of global climate change-associated droughts. However, knowledge about the mechanisms underlying divergent strategies of various tree species to adapt to drought has remained remarkably insufficient. Leaf stomatal regulation and embolism resistance of stem xylem serves as two important strategies for tree species to prevent hydraulic failure and carbon starvation, as comprising interconnected physiological mechanisms underlying drought-induced tree mortality. Hence, the physiological and anatomical determinants of leaf stomatal regulation and stems xylem embolism resistance are evaluated and discussed. In addition, root properties related to drought tolerance are also reviewed. Species with greater investment in leaves and stems tend to maintain stomatal opening and resist stem embolism under drought conditions. The coordination between stomatal regulation and stem embolism resistance are summarized and discussed. Previous studies showed that hydraulic safety margin (HSM, the difference between minimum water potential and that causing xylem dysfunction) is a significant predictor of tree species mortality under drought conditions. Compared with HSM, stomatal safety margin (the difference between water potential at stomatal closure and that causing xylem dysfunction) more directly merge stomatal regulation strategies with xylem hydraulic strategies, illustrating a comprehensive framework to characterize plant response to drought. A combination of plant traits reflecting species’ response and adaptation to drought should be established in the future, and we propose four specific urgent issues as future research priorities.},

	abstract = {Carbon allocation to growth, storage, reproduction and the effects of stress and disturbances on these processes remain poorly understood in trees. Non‐structural carbohydrates (NSC) are an important component of the carbon storage pool and are commonly used to assess whether tree growth under various conditions is carbon limited. Carbon limitation is generally assumed to result in reduced NSC levels and allocation, but changes in allocation priorities that favour NSC storage could also limit carbon available for growth. We defoliated six mature oak trees in June 2010 and explored how defoliation affects the relationship between radial growth and net NSC storage, estimated by the seasonal increase in NSC concentration, for several years. We interpret our results in the context of a conceptual model of allocation – developed here – to help understand how allocation changed following defoliation. We also monitored flower and acorn production in 2011, as changes in reproduction could also affect allocation to growth and storage. Defoliation reduced radial growth for 3 years. Stemwood starch levels and storage were also generally reduced, although not as consistently as growth. In contrast, root collar NSC storage was significantly greater in defoliated trees, allowing below‐ground stores to recover to control levels by November 2011. Defoliation had mixed effects on reproduction in 2011: production of second‐year acorns (initiated before defoliation) was not significantly affected, but there was complete cessation of flower production. Defoliation also changed the relationship between NSC allocation and growth in the 2 years following defoliation, indicating a shift in allocation favouring storage. According to our conceptual model, the positive relationship between growth and NSC allocation indicates that the allocation shifts occurred under carbon‐limiting conditions. We, therefore, propose that growth can be carbon limited by two different means: (i) a decrease in plant carbon availability and (ii) allocation shifts that reduce the priority of growth relative to other processes such as storage. Prioritizing storage over both growth and reproduction may be a strategy to protect against further disturbance or stress following storage depletion. Synthesis. Recovery following defoliation can involve substantial shifts in how trees allocate carbon between different functions, with carbohydrate storage and already initiated reproduction cycles being favoured relative to growth and new reproductive cycles.},

The stomatal and xylem hydraulic traits of all the species were measured. We found that species' stomatal closure points were strongly related to their xylem embolism resistance and xylem minimum water potential but not to their survival rates. Hydraulic failure of the vascular system appeared to be the main cause of tree mortality, and the stomatal safety margin was a better predictor of tree mortality than the traditionally considered xylem embolism resistance and hydraulic safety margin.

	abstract = {Summary 1Slower growth after repetitive browsing of young trees has been attributed to a carbon (C) limitation, but data from long-term studies are lacking. To determine if repeated summer browsing causes a C (source) limitation in trees in the long-term, we analysed the non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) and nitrogen (N) concentrations and pools of Betula pubescens saplings subjected to different clipping treatments (unclipped, 33\% and 66\% shoot removal) for 7 years. 2The short-term effect of browsing on C allocation was assessed by clipping trees with different browsing histories and analyzing their C and N responses within the same growing season. 3Long-term repetitive summer browsing significantly decreased sapling growth and soluble sugar (SS) concentrations in fine roots. However, trees subjected to different browsing histories did not change their C partitioning into starch. Although trees with a different browsing history showed differences in the NSC concentrations and pools of leaves, these differences were not maintained through time. 4Simulated browsing had no significant short-term effect on root C and N pools of birch trees, but it decreased all C pools in leaves, 1-year and current-year stems and the starch and total NSC pools in main stems. 5We conclude that although browsing may cause a temporary decrease in C pools, B. pubescens trees are able to compensate for such losses and hence are not C-limited in the long-term.},

We investigated the combined effect of different atmospheric CO2 concentrations (160, 280 and 560 ppm) and early season defoliation on the growth and C reserves (nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC)) of saplings of two oak species with different leaf habits (deciduous Quercus petraea and evergreen Quercus ilex). In both species, higher CO2 supply significantly enhanced growth. Defoliation had a strong negative impact on growth (stronger for Q. ilex), but the relative reduction of growth caused by defoliation within each CO2 treatment was very similar across all three CO2 concentrations. Low CO2 and defoliation led to decreased NSC tissue concentrations mainly in the middle of the growing season in Q. ilex, but not in Q. petraea. However, also in Q. ilex, NSC increased in woody tissues in defoliated and low-CO2 saplings towards the end of the growing season. Although the saplings were C limited under these specific experimental conditions, growth reduction after defoliation was not directly caused by C limitation. Rather, growth of trees followed a strong allometric relationship between total leaf area and conductive woody tissue, which did not change across species, CO2 concentrations and defoliation treatments.},

	abstract = {There is no consensus about how stresses such as low water availability and temperature limit tree growth. Sink limitation to growth and survival is often inferred if a given stress does not cause non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) concentrations or levels to decline along with growth. However, trees may actively maintain or increase NSC levels under moderate carbon stress, making the pattern of reduced growth and increased NSCs compatible with carbon limitation. To test this possibility, we used full and half defoliation to impose severe and moderate carbon limitation on 2-year-old Quercus velutina Lam. saplings grown in a common garden. Saplings were harvested at either 3 weeks or 4 months after treatments were applied, representing short- and longer-term effects on woody growth and NSC levels. Both defoliation treatments maintained a lower total leaf area than controls throughout the experiment with no evidence of photosynthetic up-regulation, and resulted in a similar total biomass reduction. While fully defoliated saplings had lower starch levels than controls in the short term, half defoliated saplings maintained control starch levels in both the short and longer term. In the longer term, fully defoliated saplings had the greatest starch concentration increment, allowing them to recover to near-control starch levels. Furthermore, between the two harvest dates, fully and half defoliated saplings allocated a greater proportion of new biomass to starch than did controls. The maintenance of control starch levels in half defoliated saplings indicates that these trees actively store a substantial amount of carbon before growth is carbon saturated. In addition, the allocation shift favouring storage in defoliated saplings is consistent with the hypothesis that, as an adaptation to increasing carbon stress, trees can prioritize carbon reserve formation at the expense of growth. Our results suggest that as carbon limitation increases, reduced growth is not necessarily accompanied by a decline in NSC concentrations. Therefore, a lack of NSC decline may not be evidence that reduced tree growth under cold or water stress is caused by sink limitation.},

L’objectif general de ce travail a donc ete d’ameliorer nos connaissances sur l’impact d’une defoliation sur la croissance d’arbres d’âges contrastes et soumis a differentes contraintes environnementales. Dans un premier temps, ce travail a permis de quantifier la relation entre l’intensite de defoliation de la processionnaire du pin et la perte de production du pin maritime.

L’etude des reserves carbonees et azotees nous a permis d’explorer les possibles mecanismes sous-jacents a l’effet d’une defoliation.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS There is a growing concern about how forests will respond to increased herbivory associated with climate change. Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) limitation are hypothesized to cause decreasing growth after defoliation, and eventually mortality. This study examines the effects of a natural and massive defoliation by an insect on mature trees' C and N storage, which have rarely been studied together, particularly in winter-deciduous species. METHODS Survival, growth rate, carbon [C, as non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) concentration] and nitrogen (N) storage, defences (tannins and total polyphenols), and re-foliation traits were examined in naturally defoliated and non-defoliated adult trees of the winter-deciduous temperate species Nothofagus pumilio 1 and 2 years after a massive and complete defoliation caused by the caterpillar of Ormiscodes amphimone (Saturniidae) during summer 2009 in Patagonia. KEY RESULTS Defoliated trees did not die but grew significantly less than non-defoliated trees for at least 2 years after defoliation. One year after defoliation, defoliated trees had similar NSC and N concentrations in woody tissues, higher polyphenol concentrations and lower re-foliation than non-defoliated trees. In the second year, however, NSC concentrations in branches were significantly higher in defoliated trees while differences in polyphenols and re-foliation disappeared and decreased, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The significant reduction in growth following defoliation was not caused by insufficient C or N availability, as frequently assumed; instead, it was probably due to growth limitations due to factors other than C or N, or to preventative C allocation to storage. This study shows an integrative approach to evaluating plant growth limitations in response to disturbance, by examining major resources other than C (e.g. N), and other C sinks besides storage and growth (e.g. defences and re-foliation).},

Intraspecific variation for herbicide resistance has been studied, but no studies have been conducted to determine the existence of variation for other adaptive traits that could influence weed management. The objective of this study was to examine the existence of different seed dormancy regulatory mechanisms in common waterhemp. Seed dormancy regulation, in response to different temperature and moisture regimes, was studied through germination experiments and proteome analysis using two common waterhemp biotypes (Ames and Everly) collected from agricultural fields in Iowa, and one biotype (Ohio) collected from a pristine area in Ohio. Without stratification, germination percentage among the different biotypes was 9, 29 and 88\% for Ames, Everly, and Ohio respectively. The germination rate of seeds from Ames was dramatically increased after incubation at either 4 or 25 C under wet conditions, whereas germination of seeds from Everly was only increased at 25 C under wet conditions. The Ohio biotype showed no change in germination response to any of the incubation treatments. Germination studies indicated that the rate of seed dormancy alleviation differed between biotypes. Seed protein profiles obtained from the three biotypes differed in protein abundance, number, and type. A putative small heat-shock protein (sHSP) of 17.6 kDa and isoelectric point (pI) 6.1 increased whereas a putative glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) of 30.9 kDa and pI 6.4 decreased in abundance in the Ames biotype as seed dormancy was reduced in response to incubation at 4 C and wet conditions. These two proteins did not change in the Everly and Ohio biotypes, suggesting that these proteins changed their abundance in response to seed dormancy alleviation. The results of this study suggest that differences in seed dormancy levels between the biotypes were due to different physiological regulatory mechanisms.},

The buoyancy and germination of N. peltata seeds and the development of N. peltata seedlings were studied, using seeds collected from Lake Taihu. The results indicated that a low wind velocity of 2.4–3.0 m s−1 had a slightly negative effect on seed buoyancy. After 19 and 67 h of gentle stirring, 50\% and 90\%, respectively, of the N. peltata seeds had sunk. Few seeds ﬂoated again after sinking, but these reﬂoating seeds sank soon with the disturbance. The N. peltata seeds did not germinate without stratiﬁcation, but the stratiﬁcation of seeds for a two-week period resulted in a high germination rate (63.3\%) at a light intensity of 20 ␮mol photons m−2 s−1. Both the light and stratiﬁcation treatments stimulated the seeds germination. The seeds did not germinate in sediment at depths greater than 0.25 cm. A high germination rate (74\%) was observed for the seeds that laid on the water–sediment interface; however, nearly all of the germinated seeds ﬂoated on the water surface after germination. Only a small fraction (14\%) of the buoyant seedlings could re-establish in shallow water (less than 3 cm). In the eighth week of the experiments, the buoyant seedlings that failed to re-establish rotted. When grown in low light intensity conditions, the N. peltata seedlings had smaller cotyledons, shorter primary roots, and weak development of adventitious roots. Sufﬁcient light was important for both seed germination and seedling development. It was found that sexual reproduction is likely to have little direct contribution to the rapid expansion of N. peltata towards the centre of this large shallow lake.},

After this pretreatment, the seeds germinated well at 10–25°C (optimum temperature 15°C), but did not germinate in darkness even at the optimum temperature. Most of the seeds floated on distilled water, but 20–60\% of the seeds that were collected from several populations sank in distilled water, indicating dimorphism in seed dispersal by water. The floating and sunken seeds did not show significant differences in weight and germination rate within a population. The addition of a surface-active agent in distilled water submerged the seeds, indicating that the buoyancy of the seeds is attributable to an oil coating on the seed surface that enhances the interfacial tension on the seeds. Three times the number of seeds sank in river water collected from a rural area than in distilled water. A greater number of seeds also sank in water that had increasing concentrations of linear alkylbenzenesulfonate, which is a major component of synthetic detergents. This suggests that the water dispersal of this species is suppressed by surface-active agents, including detergents, in river water.},

Both cold stratification and GA3 overcame dormancy of M. ingrata seeds. Thus, M. ingrata seeds have intermediate complex morphophysiological dormancy at maturity. Since seeds came out of dormancy after after-ripening for 100 d at 4°C, the physiological component of morphophysiological dormancy is non-deep. The initial moisture content of M. ingrata seeds was 29.5\%. Most seeds (86.1 \%) tolerated desiccation to 17.2\% moisture content while more than 70\% of seeds lost viability when dried to 15.3\% moisture content. Therefore, storage behaviour of M. ingrata seed is recalcitrant. All seeds died after storage for 100 d at -20°C while seed viability was effectively maintained at 4°C.},

Salinity is caused by high salt concentrations in the root zone that may be due to, among others, saline irrigation water. Other factors that are mostly associated with warm climates are an elevated saline water table or environmental conditions inducing high evaporation. Drip is the most appropriate irrigation method for saline conditions due to its positive interaction with soil aeration and mineral distribution in the onion-shaped irrigated root zone. American hybrid rootstocks tested in the Negev desert of Israel, among them Salt Creek and 140 Ruggeri, showed higher resistance to salinity due to their ability to limit the salt's movement into the scion of several Vinifera cultivars and thereby maintain lower Na and Cl concentrations in the leaves and fruits.},

	abstract = {A comparative study on stomatal control under water deficit was conducted on grapevines of the cultivars Grenache, of Mediterranean origin, and Syrah of mesic origin, grown near Montpellier, France and Geisenheim, Germany. Syrah maintained similar maximum stomatal conductance (gmax) and maximum leaf photosynthesis (Amax) values than Grenache at lower predawn leaf water potentials, Ψleaf, throughout the season. The Ψleaf of Syrah decreased strongly during the day and was lower in stressed than in watered plants, showing anisohydric stomatal behaviour. In contrast, Grenache showed isohydric stomatal behaviour in which Ψleaf did not drop significantly below the minimum Ψleaf of watered plants. When g was plotted versus leaf specific hydraulic conductance, Kl, incorporating leaf transpiration rate and whole-plant water potential gradients, previous differences between varieties disappeared both on a seasonal and diurnal scale. This suggested that isohydric and anisohydric behaviour could be regulated by hydraulic conductance. Pressure-flow measurements on excised organs from plants not previously stressed revealed that Grenache had a two- to three-fold larger hydraulic conductance per unit path length (Kh) and a four- to six-fold larger leaf area specific conductivity (LSC) in leaf petioles than Syrah. Differences between internodes were only apparent for LSC and were much smaller. Cavitation detected as ultrasound acoustic emissions on air-dried shoots showed higher rates for Grenache than Syrah during the early phases of the dry-down. It is hypothesized that the differences in water-conducting capacity of stems and especially petioles may be at the origin of the near-isohydric and anisohydric behaviour of g.},

In this context and considering recent literature, it is fundamental to increase our knowledge of the biochemical and physiological events that characterise stress responses in grapevine roots. In this study, leaf and root responses induced by water stress (WS) and sodium chloride (NaCl) exposure in a new selected genotype, named M4 (Vitis vinifera × V. berlandieri) × V. berlandieri cv. Resseguier n. 1), were compared with those of the commercial rootstock 101.14. Methods and Results The effect of progressive WS and NaCl exposure was studied under controlled environmental conditions on ungrafted plants grown in pots. Shoot growth, plant water status and leaf photosynthetic parameters were measured. The concentration of sugars, amino acids and total proteins, as well as the concentration of the more abundant ions, was determined in both leaf and root organs. The M4 genotype showed greater capacity to maintain photosynthetic activity, to accumulate osmotic compounds as well as to counteract Na and Cl accumulation. Conclusion The M4 genotype exhibited a greater capacity to tolerate both WS and exposure to an increasing concentration of Na and Cl, maintaining photosynthetic activity also under severe stress conditions. The root system appeared to play a central role in sustaining biochemical and physiological responses experienced under these adverse conditions. Significance of the Study This study showed that the tolerance to abiotic stress conditions, such as WS and NaCl exposure, depends on root integrity/functionality, confirming that these aspects must be considered in further selection programs.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims:  A 3-year study was carried out in order to evaluate the ecophysiology, yield and quality characteristics of Vitis vinifera L. cv. Kékfrankos (syn. Limberger) at Eger-Nagyeged hill (steep slope) and at Eger-Kőlyuktető (flat) vineyard sites located in the Eger wine region, Hungary. The aim of this paper was to analyse the effect of ‘vintage’ and ‘terroir’ on the seasonal changes of Kékfrankos ecophysiology and its possible relationship with yield and wine composition.Methods and Results:  Grapevine physiological responses (midday- and pre-dawn water potential, pressure–volume analysis and gas-exchange), growing stages, yield and wine composition of each vineyard were studied. Lower grapevine water supply was detected at Eger-Nagyeged hill in each season due to its steep slope and soil characteristics. Pressure-volume curves indicated that there was no osmotic adjustment in the leaves of this variety. Higher osmotic concentration was measured at turgor loss and full turgor in the leaves of the unstressed vineyard (Eger-Kőlyuktető) presumably due to higher photosynthetic activity. Differences in soil water content of the vineyards resulted in a slightly altered cell wall elasticity. Stomatal conductance, transpiration rate and photosynthetic production per unit leaf area were affected by water availability. Lower yield in Eger-Nagyeged hill was partly associated with decreased photosynthetic production of the canopy. Improved wine quality of Eger-Nagyeged hill was due to moderate water stress which induced higher concentration of anthocyanins and phenolics in the berries. The duration of the phenological stages was dependent on vintage temperature characteristics rather than on vineyard site.Conclusion:  There was a close relationship between environmental conditions, Kékfrankos gas-exchange, water relations, yield and wine composition. Water deficit plays an important role in creating a terroir effect, resulting in decreased yield, better sun exposure of leaves and clusters and thus higher concentration of phenolics and anthocyanins. Although quality is mainly influenced by vintage differences, vineyard characteristics are able to buffer unfavourable vintage effects even within a small wine region.Significance of the Study:  Stomatal conductance, pre-dawn water potential and climatic data may be reliable parameters for terroir classification, although variety–terroir interactions must always be considered.},

	abstract = {Current understanding of physiological mechanisms governing stomatal behavior under water stress conditions is still incomplete and controversial. It has been proposed that coordination of stomatal kinetics with xylem vulnerability to cavitation [vulnerability curve (VC)] leads to different levels of isohydry/anisohydry in different plant species/cultivars. In this study, this hypothesis is tested in Vitis vinifera cultivars displaying contrasting stomatal behavior under drought stress. The cv Montepulciano (MP, near-isohydric) and Sangiovese (SG, anisohydric) were compared in terms of stomatal response to leaf and stem water potential, as possibly correlated to different petiole hydraulic conductivity (k(petiole)) and VC, as well as to leaf water relations parameters. MP leaves showed almost complete stomatal closure at higher leaf and stem water potentials than SG leaves. Moreover, MP petioles had higher maximum k(petiole) and were more vulnerable to cavitation than SG. Water potential at the turgor loss point was higher in MP than in SG. In SG, the percentage reduction of stomatal conductance (PLg(s)) under water stress was almost linearly correlated with corresponding percentage loss of k(petiole) (PLC), while in MP PLg(s) was less influenced by PLC. Our results suggest that V. vinifera near-isohydric and anisohydric genotypes differ in terms of xylem vulnerability to cavitation as well as in terms of k(petiole) and that the coordination of these traits leads to their different stomatal responses under water stress conditions.},

The different irrigation levels significantly altered the Ψleaf and gs of the vines across both seasons. ABA abundance in the xylem sap was correlated with gs. The expression of genes associated with ABA synthesis, NCED1 and NCED2, was higher in the roots than in the leaves throughout and highest in the roots in mid January, a time when soil moisture declined and VPD was at its highest. Their expression in roots was also inversely related to the levels of irrigation and correlated with ABA abundance in the roots, xylem sap, and leaves. Three genes encoding ABA 8'-hydroxylases were isolated and their identities confirmed by expression in yeast cells. The expression of one of these, Hyd1, was elevated in leaves when VPD was below 2.0-2.5 kPa and minimal at higher VPD levels. The results provide evidence that ABA plays an important role in linking stomatal response to soil moisture status and that changes in ABA catabolism at or near its site of action allows optimization of gas exchange to current environmental conditions.},

Well-watered plants (FI) (100\% ETc) and non-irrigated grapevines (NI) were also studied. Partial stomata closure occurred in both PRD and DI plants. [ABA] of xylem sap remained constant during the day and was maintained throughout the season, with higher values in NI plants. Xylem sap pH was not affected by soil water availability. A positive correlation between ψpd and maximum g s was found, indicating that grapevine stomata strongly respond to plant water status. In contrast, ABA did not explain stomatal control at veraison. At mid-ripening g s was significantly correlated with ABA, apparently interacting with the rise in xylem sap pH. Therefore, our data suggest that hydraulic feedback and feed-forward root-to-shoot chemical signalling mechanisms might be involved in the control of stomata in response to decreased soil water availability, hydraulic signals playing the dominant role.},

The surface of mesophyll cells exposed to the intercellular air spaces per unit leaf area was also lower in Shiraz, but there were no significant differences in the calculated value of the leaf internal CO2 gas phase resistance between the cultivars. The differences in the rate of photosynthesis might be attributed to differences in the CO2 liquid-phase resistance in the leaves.},

The aim was to increase our knowledge of the relationships between water availability, canopy water losses, photosynthesis, and fruit yield and quality. A second aim was to analyse some of the mechanisms of photosynthetic down-regulation under drought, such as the capacity for RuBP regeneration and Rubisco activity.Moderate irrigation improved plant water status, leaf photosynthesis and transpiration. Considering the results over ten years, soil water availability (estimated as pre-dawn leaf water potential, ΨPD) largely determined leaf photosynthesis and leaf transpiration. Decreased photosynthesis was due to both stomatal and non-stomatal factors. The latter were related to decayed electron transport rate and reduced RuBP regeneration capacity, but not to decreased Rubisco activity.Moderate irrigation also improved grape yield, although this effect was much larger in Tempranillo than in Manto Negro. Moreover, the correlation between photosynthesis and grape yield was significant in Tempranillo, but not in Manto Negro. In contrast, the correlation between ΨPD and several parameters reflecting fruit quality (such as soluble solids and total polyphenol content) was significant only in Manto Negro. These results suggest that there is a close link between water availability and grape yield, mostly through water stress effects on photosynthesis. Drought effects on grape quality are linked to water availability but not to photosynthesis or yield.},

'Tempranillo' during two consecutive years in a commercial vineyard with a deep, light-clay soil located in Requena, Valencia, Spain. Partial rootzone drying applied at two amounts (100\% and 50\% of the estimated crop evapotranspiration), was compared to conventional drip irrigation, and also to rainfed vines. Results showed that the effects of irrigation amount on yield and wine quality were different between years. In 2003 with low yield values (around 6.3 t ha-1) irrigation did neither affect grape production nor wine quality. However, in the following year, with much higher general yield (17 t ha-1), the high irrigation dose increased yield by 30\% compared to rainfed vines and it also increased must total soluble solids and wine alcohol content. In both seasons, PRD did not significantly affect physiological parameters, nor growth, yield or fruit and wine quality, when compared to the same amount of water applied by conventional drip irrigation. Overall these results suggest that, under our experimental conditions, it was the irrigation amount rather than the system of application what affected vine performance, indicating the difficulties of successfully employing the PRD type of irrigation with a drip system in heavy and deep soils.},

The two thinned treatments had only 12.4\% higher CPFDInt than in UT (1167.1 μmol m−2 s−1) due to the increased leaf self-shading.

Here we address the question of whether water stress affects the photochemical capacity of leaves, measuring gas-exchange rates and chlorophyll fluorescence under drought and moderate irrigat- ion at intervals through the summer season during three consecutive years. We conclude that usually water stress does not induce photoinhibition in field-grown grapevines, even when stomatal conductance and photosynthesis are reduced to very low values. Moreover, down-regulat- ion of photochemical reactions is low, leading to a general pattern of photosynthetic response to drought consistent in large reductions of stomatal conductance (g), followed by a consistent decrease of CO2 assimilation (A) but with a much lower effect on electron transport rate (ETR). In consequence, the intrinsic water-use efficiency (A/g) increased, as well as the ratio ETR/A. It is suggested that increased electron transport to alternative pathways, such as photorespiration, prevented further down-regulation of ETR under drought conditions. These results are in agreement with our previous reports for potted plants. However it is clear that, under field conditions with a much more slowly developed water stress, ETR reductions are more attenuated than in potted plants, reducing their incidence in carbon assimilation, which seems to be mainly regulated by stomatal closure.},

	abstract = {Improvements in water use efficiency of crops are essential under the scenarios of water scarcity predicted by global change models for the Mediterranean region. In recent years, deficit irrigation, including partial root drying (PRD), has been proposed as an irrigation technique to improve water use efficiency and standardize grapevine yield and quality. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of deficit irrigation on photosynthetic responses of field grown grapevines of cv. Moscatel and Castelão. The treatments were: full irrigation (FI), corresponding to 100\% ETc; non-irrigated, but rain fed (NI) and partial root zone drying (PRD) and deficit irrigation (DI), both corresponding to an irrigation of 50\% ETc. While in the DI treatment water was applied to both sides of the root system, in the PRD treatment, water was supplied to only one side of the root system, alternating sides periodically. In both cultivars, PRD and DI vines showed intermediate pre-dawn leaf water potential (ψpd) values (around −0.4MPa) while FI vines, showed ψpd around −0.2MPa during the growing season. NI showed the lowest ψpd, reaching −0.6MPa in Moscatel and −0.8MPa in Castelão, at the end of growing season. Water status of PRD vines remained closer to FI than DI, especially at midday. Photosynthetic rates and fluorescence parameters of the deficit irrigation treatments (PRD and DI) did not show significant differences from FI vines, for most of the season. In Moscatel, although PRD generally showed gs, relative stomatal limitation (RSL) and intrinsic water use efficiency (A/gs) values closer to NI than DI, most of the differences between PRD and DI were not statistically significant. Our results showed a stability of the photosynthetic machinery in grapevines under low-to-moderate water availabilities, as demonstrated by the maintenance of the activity of three Calvin Cycle enzymes and of the Vcmax values. However, a decline in Jmax was observed in NI vines, that can be a result either of a decrease in ATP production or, alternatively, of decreased mesophyll conductance to CO2 diffusion. In general terms, stomatal limitation of photosynthesis is likely to be dominant in non-irrigated plants. Deficit irrigation had no negative impact on CO2 assimilation, despite less water application than in full-irrigation. Differences among varieties may be related to differences in sensitivity of stomata, shoot growth and/or the interaction between rootstock and cultivar to soil water availability.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims: Near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy techniques are not only used for a variety of physical and chemical analyses in the food industry, but also in remote sensing studies as tools to predict plant water status. In this study, NIR spectroscopy was evaluated as a method to estimate water potential of grapevines. Methods and Results: Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay and Shiraz leaves were scanned using an Integrated Spectronic (300–1100 nm) or an ASD FieldSpec® 3 (Analytical Spectral Devices, Boulder, Colorado, USA) (350–1850 nm) spectrophotometer and then measured to obtain midday leaf water potential using a pressure chamber. On the same shoot, the leaf adjacent the one used for midday leaf water potential measurement was used to measure midday stem water potential. Calibrations were built and NIR showed good prediction ability (standard error in cross validation (SECV) {\textless}0.24 MPa) for stem water potential for each of the three grapevine varieties. The best calibration was obtained for the prediction of stem water potential in Shiraz (R = 0.92 and a SECV = 0.09 MPa). Conclusion: Differences in the NIR spectra were related to the leaf surface from which the spectra were collected, and this had an effect on the accuracy of the calibration results for water potential. We demonstrated that NIR can be used as a simple and rapid method to detect grapevine water status. Significance of the Study: Grapevine water potential can be measured using NIR spectroscopy. The advantages of this new approach are speed and low cost of analysis. It may be possible for NIR to be used as a non-destructive, in-field tool for irrigation scheduling.},

	abstract = {The role of root systems in drought tolerance is a subject of very limited information compared with above-ground responses. Adjustments to the ability of roots to supply water relative to shoot transpiration demand is proposed as a major means for woody perennial plants to tolerate drought, and is often expressed as changes in the ratios of leaf to root area (AL:AR). Seasonal root proliferation in a directed manner could increase the water supply function of roots independent of total root area (AR) and represents a mechanism whereby water supply to demand could be increased. To address this issue, seasonal root proliferation, stomatal conductance (gs) and whole root system hydraulic conductance (kr) were investigated for a drought-tolerant grape root system (Vitis berlandieri×V. rupestris cv. 1103P) and a non-drought-tolerant root system (Vitis riparia×V. rupestris cv. 101-14Mgt), upon which had been grafted the same drought-sensitive clone of Vitis vinifera cv. Merlot. Leaf water potentials (ψL) for Merlot grafted onto the 1103P root system (–0.91±0.02 MPa) were +0.15 MPa higher than Merlot on 101-14Mgt (–1.06±0.03 MPa) during spring, but dropped by approximately –0.4 MPa from spring to autumn, and were significantly lower by –0.15 MPa (–1.43±0.02 MPa) than for Merlot on 101-14Mgt (at –1.28±0.02 MPa). Surprisingly, gs of Merlot on the drought-tolerant root system (1103P) was less down-regulated and canopies maintained evaporative fluxes ranging from 35–20 mmol vine−1 s−1 during the diurnal peak from spring to autumn, respectively, three times greater than those measured for Merlot on the drought-sensitive rootstock 101-14Mgt. The drought-tolerant root system grew more roots at depth during the warm summer dry period, and the whole root system conductance (kr) increased from 0.004 to 0.009 kg MPa−1 s−1 during that same time period. The changes in kr could not be explained by xylem anatomy or conductivity changes of individual root segments. Thus, the manner in which drought tolerance was conveyed to the drought-sensitive clone appeared to arise from deep root proliferation during the hottest and driest part of the season, rather than through changes in xylem structure, xylem density or stomatal regulation. This information can be useful to growers on a site-specific basis in selecting rootstocks for grape clonal material (scions) grafted to them.},

The transcriptome variation in response to different soils and rootstocks was investigated through microarray technology. The cv.

The objective of this study was to determine whether grafting two different grapevine genotypes alters gene expression at the graft interface in comparison to the presumably wound-like gene expression changes induced in autografts. Gene expression at the graft interface was studied 3, 7, 14, and 28 d after grafting in hetero- and autografts of grapevine (Vitis spp.). Genes differentially expressed between the hetero- and autografts during graft union formation were identified. These genes were clustered according to their expression profile over the time course. MapMan and Gene Ontology enrichment analysis revealed the coordinated upregulation of genes from numerous functional categories related to stress responses in the hetero- compared to the autografts. This indicates that heterografting with nonself rootstocks upregulates stress responses at the graft interface, potentially suggesting that the cells of the graft interface can detect the presence of a nonself grafting partner.},

Manade) covering over 50\% of the soil surface, and permanent grass covering over 25\% of the soil surface achieved by a grass interrow alternating with a herbicide-treated interrow. At the end of the experiment in 1994, observations showed that the permanent grass cover caused a considerable decrease in the number of vine roots in the interrow, mainly in the upper soil layers, but an increase close to the row. The amount of organic matter, nitrogen, exchangeable K2O, pH, and soil moisture at field capacity increased under permanent grass cover, while bulk density and the mechanical resistance of the soil decreased.},

Cabernet Sauvignon was hetero-grafted with two commercial rootstock genotypes and auto-grafted with itself. Vigor was quantified by measurements of root, stem, leaf and trunk biomass. Gene expression profiling was done using a whole genome grapevine microarray; four pools of five shoot apex samples were harvested 4 months after grafting for each scion/rootstock combination.},

In addition, the distribution of roots in the soil profile of all three rootstocks were mapped and measurements of leaf net CO2 assimilation taken on replicate vines. There was no effect of rootstock on the partitioning of dry matter among the organs of these vines, with the exception of the trunk. There also was no effect of rootstock on the concentrations of potassium in these organs. The rootstock with the lowest N concentration in the root system also had the lowest N concentration in its fruit. There were large differences in the number of root intercepts among the rootstocks, with AxR 1 having the lowest number and St. George having the greatest number per soil wall profile. There were no apparent differences in the distribution of roots of any dimension within the soil among the rootstocks. There was a significant reduction in the stomatal conductance of leaves on vines grafted onto AxR 1 compared with the two other rootstocks. The results indicate that rootstock had no effect on the partitioning of dry matter and the concentrations of N and K in the organs of mature Cabernet Sauvignon vines at this location. The lower density of roots in the soil profile of the AxR 1 rootstock may have affected the gas exchange of the scion.},

The effect of partial defoliation (33\%) in the lower half of the canopy at berry set stage, and thereafter at pea-size and veraison, respectively, on root development, distribution, and composition as well as on canopy efficiency, yield, grape composition, and wine quality was investigated. Defoliation evidently stimulated occurrence of fine and extension roots, which may have increased the absorptive capacity of the root system. Root number decreased with increasing depth and roots occurred predominantly in the top 800 mm of the soil profile. Starch was the principal carbohydrate storage form in the roots, irrespective of root size. Starch synthesis appeared not affected by root age. Sucrose and organic acid patterns were similar. Citric and tartaric acids were the main organic acids in roots, followed by malic acid. Elevated sugar and organic acid levels were found in roots of treated vines. The results demonstrate that the remaining leaves of partially defoliated vines were able to sustain normal metabolic functions in the roots. Canopy density was efficiently reduced by partial defoliation, leading to increased light penetration, fruit exposure, and photosynthetic activity of mature and old leaves. Although partially defoliated vines had much less leaf area per gram fresh berry mass at ripeness, yield increased considerably with defoliation at pea-size and veraison. Root density, yield, and cane mass were related. Grape total soluble sugar content was unaffected, but titratable acidity increased and the pH of the must decreased with partial defoliation. Ostensible increases in wine constituents (anthocyanins, phenolics), color density, cultivar character intensity, and overall wine quality were found in wines from treated vines.},

	abstract = {Improvements in water use efficiency of crops are essential under the scenarios of water scarcity predicted by global change models for the Mediterranean region. In recent years, deficit irrigation, including partial root drying (PRD), has been proposed as an irrigation technique to improve water use efficiency and standardize grapevine yield and quality. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of deficit irrigation on photosynthetic responses of field grown grapevines of cv. Moscatel and Castelão. The treatments were: full irrigation (FI), corresponding to 100\% ETc; non-irrigated, but rain fed (NI) and partial root zone drying (PRD) and deficit irrigation (DI), both corresponding to an irrigation of 50\% ETc. While in the DI treatment water was applied to both sides of the root system, in the PRD treatment, water was supplied to only one side of the root system, alternating sides periodically. In both cultivars, PRD and DI vines showed intermediate pre-dawn leaf water potential (ψpd) values (around −0.4MPa) while FI vines, showed ψpd around −0.2MPa during the growing season. NI showed the lowest ψpd, reaching −0.6MPa in Moscatel and −0.8MPa in Castelão, at the end of growing season. Water status of PRD vines remained closer to FI than DI, especially at midday. Photosynthetic rates and fluorescence parameters of the deficit irrigation treatments (PRD and DI) did not show significant differences from FI vines, for most of the season. In Moscatel, although PRD generally showed gs, relative stomatal limitation (RSL) and intrinsic water use efficiency (A/gs) values closer to NI than DI, most of the differences between PRD and DI were not statistically significant. Our results showed a stability of the photosynthetic machinery in grapevines under low-to-moderate water availabilities, as demonstrated by the maintenance of the activity of three Calvin Cycle enzymes and of the Vcmax values. However, a decline in Jmax was observed in NI vines, that can be a result either of a decrease in ATP production or, alternatively, of decreased mesophyll conductance to CO2 diffusion. In general terms, stomatal limitation of photosynthesis is likely to be dominant in non-irrigated plants. Deficit irrigation had no negative impact on CO2 assimilation, despite less water application than in full-irrigation. Differences among varieties may be related to differences in sensitivity of stomata, shoot growth and/or the interaction between rootstock and cultivar to soil water availability.},

	abstract = {Hyperspectral reflectance tools have been used to detect multiple pathogens in agricultural settings and single sources of infection or broad declines in forest stands. However, differentiation of any one disease from other sources of tree stress is integral for stand and landscape-level applications in mixed species systems. We tested the ability of spectral models to differentiate oak wilt, a fatal disease in oaks caused by Bretziella fagacearum “Bretz” , from among other mechanisms of decline. We subjected greenhouse-grown oak seedlings (Quercus ellipsoidalis “E.J. Hill” and Quercus macrocarpa “Michx.” ) to chronic drought or inoculation with the oak wilt fungus or bur oak blight fungus (Tubakia iowensis “T.C. Harr. \& D. McNew” ). We measured leaf and canopy spectroscopic reflectance (400–2400 nm) and instantaneous photosynthetic and stomatal conductance rates, then used partial least-squares discriminant analysis to predict treatment from hyperspectral data. We detected oak wilt before symptom appearance, and classified the disease with high accuracy in symptomatic leaves. Classification accuracy from spectra increased with declines in photosynthetic function in oak wiltinoculated plants. Wavelengths diagnostic of oak wilt were only found in non-visible spectral regions and are associated with water status, non-structural carbohydrates and photosynthetic mechanisms. We show that hyperspectral models can differentiate oak wilt from other causes of tree decline and that detection is correlated with biological mechanisms of oak wilt infection and disease progression. We also show that within the canopy, symptom heterogeneity can reduce detection, but that symptomatic leaves and tree canopies are suitable for highly accurate diagnosis. Remote application of hyperspectral tools can be used for specific detection of disease across a multi-species forest stand exhibiting multiple stress symptoms.},

Twig growth correlated negatively with foliage phenols, particularly in growing seasons following cool summers, but did not correlate with foliage nitrogen. Birches flushing early did not grow more than birches flushing late. Between-site differences in foliage phenol content were mainly determined by abiotic conditions, like temperature and nutrient availability. In a between-site comparison insect chewing marks in leaves correlated positively with foliage phenols as well as with nitrogen; intensity of invertebrate predation presumably explained variable herbivory between the sites. In a within-site comparison trees with the highest foliage phenol content had few herbivores only at the site with the highest average phenol level.},

	abstract = {The foliage and fruit of the tomato plant Lycopersicon esculentum contains polyphenol oxidases (PPO) and peroxidases (POD) that are compartmentally separated from orthodihydroxyphenolic substrates in situ. However, when leaf tissue is damaged by insect feeding, the enzyme and phenolic substrates come in contact, resulting in the rapid oxidation of phenolics to orthoquinones. When the tomato fruitworm Heliothis zea or the beet armyworm Spodoptera exigua feed on tomato foliage, a substantial amount of the ingested chlorogenic acid is oxidized to chlorogenoquinone by PPO in the insect gut. Additionally, the digestive enzymes of the fruitwoma have the potential to further activate foliar oxidase activity in the gut. Chlorogenoquinone is a highly reactive electrophilic molecule that readily binds covalently to nucleophilic groups of amino acids and proteins. In particular, the --SH and --NH2 groups of amino acids are susceptible to binding or alkylation. In experiments with tomato foliage, the relative growth rate of the fruitworm was negatively correlated with PPO activity. As the tomato plant matures, foliar PPO activity may increase nearly 10-fold while the growth rate of the fruitworm is severely depressed. In tomato fruit, the levels of PPO are highest in small immature fruit but are essentially negligible in mature fruit. The growth rate of larvae on fruit was also negatively correlated with PPO activity, with the fastest larval growth rate occurring when larvae fed on mature fruit. The reduction in larval growth is proposed to result from the alkylation of amino acids/protein by o-quinones, and the subsequent reduction in the nutritive quality of foliage. This alkylation reduces the digestibility of dietary protein and the bioavailability of amino acids. We believe that this mechanism of digestibility reduction may be extrapolatable to other plantinsect systems because of the ubiquitous cooccurrence of PPO and phenolic substrates among vascular plant species.},

Larch defoliation (100\%) by either the fungus or insect, but not mechanical removal, induced systemic responses that reduced sawfly consumption and digestion rates one year later. In a feeding behavior assay, larvae quickly abandoned seedlings previously defoliated by M. laricinia. Adult female oviposition choice and egg deposition were unaffected. Seedling growth was not affected during the year of defoliation by M. laricinia, but was significantly reduced one year later. Defoliation by M. laricinia reduced stem volume, radial growth, root biomass and new shoot production. The latter tissue is the only oviposition resource for larch sawfly, and, in contrast, is not influenced by sawfly feeding. We hypothesize that M. laricinia infection may limit larch sawfly populations where both species coexist. However, this reduction is at a substantial net cost to larch productivity.},

Non-native plant species that have been brought into a new geographic area and have a negative effect on the ecosystems supporting horticulture and agriculture are known as invasive plant species. Invasive/noxious weeds, which are widely distributed in many types of ecosystems, significantly reduce crop production. Compared to native species, invading plant species have a higher potential to move their niche more rapidly and are more likely to adapt to new environments. The timing, speed, and longevity of seed germination have indeed been discovered to change as a result of climate change, which has consequences for plant invasions. More than native plant species, invasive plant species gain from atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) enrichment, greenhouse gas emissions, and global warming. A loss of native biodiversity due to invasive species includes species extinction, changes in hydrology, and altered ecosystem function.},

Autumn leaves and reserve organs ({\textless}1 year shoots, {\textgreater}1 year shoots, stem above and below the graft union, the tap root, and fine roots) during dormancy of young peach trees were evaluated following warmer fall temperatures and limited soil moisture on two cultivars (‘Scarletprince’ and ‘Autumnprince’ both on GuardianTM rootstock) over two seasons. Four treatments were established for the two cultivars: (1) well-watered trees (100\% ETc needs) in ambient outdoor temperatures; (2) water deficient trees (50\% ETc needs) in ambient outdoor temperatures; (3) well-watered trees grown within a greenhouse; and (4) water deficient trees within a greenhouse. The greenhouse environment was on average 5°C warmer than the ambient outdoor temperature. Senescence was delayed on greenhouse-grown trees both years with leaf number and area similar in the greenhouse and outdoor environments prior to senescence. Across leaf samples, leaf nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were lower within delayed senescence tree leaves while potassium was lower in leaves experiencing normal senescence. During dormancy, multiple reserve organs showed higher nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in trees with delayed senescence than normal senescence and similar increases were observed in water-deficient trees compared to well-watered trees. Phosphorus and potassium concentrations were also higher in multiple reserve organs within ‘Autumnprince’ trees compared to ‘Scarletprince’ trees. This study suggests variable climate conditions of increased temperatures or reduced soil moisture during autumn resulting in delayed senescence influence the process of nutrient resorption and increase nutrient storage within reserve organs.},

	abstract = {The effects of winter chilling, spring forcing temperature, and photoperiod on spring phenology are well known for many European and North American species, but the environmental cues that regulate the spring phenology of East Asian species have not yet been thoroughly investigated. Here, we conducted a growth chamber experiment to test the effects of chilling (controlled by different lengths of exposure to natural chilling conditions), forcing temperature (12, 15, or 18°C) and photoperiod (14 or 10 h) on first flowering date (FFD) of six woody species (three shrubs and three trees) native to East Asia. The three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) separately for each species showed that the effects of chilling and forcing temperature were significant for almost all species (P {\textless} 0.05). Averaged over all chilling and photoperiod treatments, the number of days until FFD decreased by 2.3–36.1 days when the forcing temperature increased by 3°C. More chilling days reduced the time to FFD by 0.7–26 days, when averaged over forcing and photoperiod treatments. A longer photoperiod could advance the FFD by 1.0–5.6 days, on average, but its effect was only significant for two species (including one tree and one shrub). The effects of forcing temperature and photoperiod interacted with chilling for half of the studied species, being stronger in the low chilling than high chilling treatment. These results could be explained by the theory and model of growing degree-days (GDD). Increased exposure to chilling coupled to a longer photoperiod reduced the GDD requirement for FFD, especially when plants grew under low chilling conditions. However, shrubs (except Viburnum dilatatum) had lower chilling and heat requirements than trees, suggesting that, by leafing out sooner, they engage in a more opportunistic life strategy to maximize their growing season, especially before canopy closure from trees' foliage. Our results confirmed the varying effects of these three cues on the flowering phenology of woody species native to East Asia. In future climate change scenarios, spring warming is likely to advance the spring phenology of those woody species, although the reduced chilling and shorter photoperiod may partly offset this spring warming effect.},

	abstract = {Effects of lake evaporation (EW) on basin evapotranspiration (ETB) and lake water storage change (LWSC) at lake-basin scale have never been reported for most basins on the inner Tibetan Plateau (IB). In this study, EW of 118 large lakes in 95 closed lake-basins were estimated, and its effects on ETB and LWSC over 2001–2018 were examined using a derivative-guided framework from the aspects of EW amount, rate, trend slope and inter-annual variability. We found that EW amount has a high effect (17\%) on regional ETB amount compared to the average lake area ratio (α) (∼5\%), and the effect has increased significantly (2\%/10 a). The spatial pattern of the effect is mainly controlled by α, and the increasing trend of α (0.6\%/10 a) also dominated the increasing trend in regional ETB rate (0.30 mm/a) though with large spatial heterogeneity. Variance in α and EW rate have a minor effect (∼3\%) on ETB variance, especially for the basins with lower α. The combination of quasi lake inflow (RL, 41\%) and lake surface precipitation (PW, 16\%) offset the depletion of EW (−43\%), resulting in the surplus of regional lake water (LWSC {\textgreater} 0). The increase in EW mount, which is mainly from lake area expansion (90\%), caused a decreasing trend in LWSC (i.e., slower growth rate) with a contribution of −59\%. This suggests a negative feedback between lake area expansion and EW amount in the IB, and the feedback may continue with the predicted area increases.},

Lake surface conditions, such as ice cover, surface temperature, evaporation and water level, respond dramatically to this threat, as observed in recent decades. In this Review, we discuss physical lake variables and their responses to climate change. Decreases in winter ice cover and increases in lake surface temperature modify lake mixing regimes and accelerate lake evaporation. Where not balanced by increased mean precipitation or inflow, higher evaporation rates will favour a decrease in lake level and surface water extent. Together with increases in extreme-precipitation events, these lake responses will impact lake ecosystems, changing water quantity and quality, food provisioning, recreational opportunities and transportation. Future research opportunities, including enhanced observation of lake variables from space (particularly for small water bodies), improved in situ lake monitoring and the development of advanced modelling techniques to predict lake processes, will improve our global understanding of lake responses to a changing climate.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing provides spatially and temporally continuous measures of forest reflectance, and vegetation indices calculated from satellite data can be useful for monitoring climate change impacts on forest tree phenology. Monitoring of evergreen coniferous forest is more difficult than monitoring of deciduous forest, as the new buds only account for a small proportion of the green biomass, and the shoot elongation process is relatively slow. In this study, we have analyzed data from 186 coniferous monitoring sites in Sweden covering boreal, southern-boreal, and boreo-nemoral conditions. Our objective was to examine the possibility to track seasonal changes in coniferous forests by time-series of MODIS eight-day vegetation indices, testing the coherence between satellite monitored vegetation indices (VI) and temperature dependent phenology. The relationships between two vegetation indices (NDVI and WDRVI) and four phenological indicators (length of snow season, modeled onset of vegetation period, tree cold hardiness level and timing of budburst) were analyzed. The annual curves produced by two curve fitting methods for smoothening of seasonal changes in NDVI and WDRVI were to a large extent characterized by the occurrence of snow, producing stable seasonal oscillations in the northern part and irregular curves with less pronounced annual amplitude in the southern part of the country. Measures based on threshold values of the VI-curves, commonly used for determining the timing of different phenological phases, were not applicable for Swedish coniferous forests. Evergreen vegetation does not have a sharp increase in greenness during spring, and the melting of snow can influence the vegetation indices at the timing of budburst in boreal forests. However, the interannual variation in VI-values for specific eight-day periods was correlated with the phenological indicators. This relation can be used for satellite monitoring of potential climate change impacts on northern coniferous spring phenology.},

Prior to planting, nursery-produced seedlings were placed in cold storage (−3°C) and root growth potential (RGP) and total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) root reserves were tested at 0, 10, 75 and after 150 (container) and 190 days (BR) of storage. Both container and BR stock had much lower root to shoot ratios (RSRs) and root carbohydrate reserves compared to UR seedlings after 170 days. During storage, root reserves in container stock declined faster than in the BR and UR seedlings. RGP in all nursery stock was the highest after 75 days of storage, while longer storage resulted in shoot dieback and reduced root growth. After the first growing season, UR seedlings were one tenth the size of the nursery stock; however, in the second growing season they had no stem dieback and grew twice the height and stem diameter. The higher RSRs and root reserves in the UR seedlings was likely caused by early bud set in its first year of growth. This suggests that inducing bud set earlier in the growing regime might allow seedlings to increase root mass and carbohydrate reserves.},

	abstract = {Increasingly, trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) is being planted in stressful situations such as forest land reclamation, afforestation and forest restoration in North America. This is due to its fast potential for growth and high resiliency, but its indeterminate growth strategy provides a special challenge in creating suitable planting stock for these sites. Clues from naturally established aspen seedlings suggest that root total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) reserves and root:shoot ratio could be strongly related to subsequent seedling establishment and growth. Carbon allocation in plants is generally partitioned between reserve accumulation and growth and development. Under conditions in controlled nurseries, the allocation of carbohydrates to reserves could be manipulated in order to produce seedlings designed for specific environmental conditions. To manipulate seedling characteristics we attempted to induce premature bud set during nursery culture while allowing continued photosynthesis. Treatments included applying different fertilizer regimes, light intensities, reducing photoperiod and use of a shoot growth inhibitor. The shoot growth inhibitor was the most reliable treatment and resulted in complete bud set, while blackout was successful only when seedlings were grown outside. Low nutrient treatments also resulted in early bud set; however, leaves were abscised much earlier. There was a distinct trade-off between growth and reserve accumulation with the late bud set. A longer period of height growth reduced root and total TNC reserves, while early bud set allowed for continued photosynthesis and produced the highest levels of root and total TNC reserves in seedlings. Increased TNC reserves of aspen planting stock was positively related to height growth after outplanting, with root TNC reserves as high as 33\% of dry weight and root:shoot ratios greater than 2 associated with the best growth.},

	abstract = {Nutrient loading of nursery seedling stock of species with an indeterminate growth strategy is challenging and poorly understood. Here, we explore the use of two potential techniques for nutrient loading of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) seedlings: (1) exponential fertilization and (2) early shoot growth termination in order to divert assimilated nutrients and carbon to storage rather than to growth. In the first study, aspen seedlings were treated with either exponential or constant fertilization rates, both of which supplied the same amount of nutrients over the growing season. Exponential fertilization resulted in overall poor planting stock form (stunted seedling growth and weak root development) and produced only marginal improvements of nutrient status. As a result, the exponential fertilization regime studied cannot be recommended as a treatment for aspen seedlings. In the second study we treated seedlings with a 2 × 2 factorial combination of fertilization and shoot growth inhibitor (SGI) applications with the fertilizer treatments varying in terms of mid-season fertilizer concentrations. Seedlings with SGI application had much higher tissue nutrient and carbon reserve concentrations than seedlings without a SGI application. In addition, nutrient uptake appeared to be more efficient in SGI treated seedlings, which could potentially result in significant reductions of nutrient application rates during aspen seedling production in nurseries. Overall, early shoot growth termination using a SGI appears to be an effective technique to produce nutrient loaded aspen seedlings.},

	abstract = {Drought-induced tree mortality, which rapidly alters forest ecosystem composition, structure, and function, as well as the feedbacks between the biosphere and climate, has occurred worldwide over the past few decades, and is expected to increase pervasively as climate change progresses. The objectives of this review are to (1) highlight the likely ecological consequences of drought-induced tree mortality, (2) synthesize the hypotheses related to drought-induced tree mortality, (3) discuss the implications of current knowledge for modeling tree mortality processes under climate change, and (4) highlight future research needs. First, we emphasize the likely ecological consequences of tree mortality from ecosystem to biome to continental scales. We then document and criticize multiple non-exclusive tree mortality hypotheses (e.g., carbon starvation — carbon supply is less than carbon demand; and hydraulic failure — desiccation from failed water transport) from a more comprehensive ecological perspective. Next, we extend a forest decline concept model, Manion’s framework, by considering new emerging environmental conditions, for a more thorough understanding of the effects of climate change on forest decline. We find that an increase in drought frequency and (or) climate-change-type droughts may trigger increased background tree mortality rates and severe forest dieback events, accelerating species turnover and ecological regime shifts. The contribution of CO2 fertilization, rising temperature within the optimal growth range, and increased nitrogen deposition may defer or reduce this trend in tree mortality, but such contributions will vary between locations, species, and tree sizes. Multiple hypotheses proposed for drought-induced tree mortality are discussed, but coupling carbon and water cycles could help resolve the debate. The absence of a physiological understanding of tree mortality mechanisms limits the predictive ability of current models from stand-level process-based models to dynamic global vegetation models. We thus suggest that long-term observations, experiments, and models should be tightly interwoven during the research process to better forecast future climate changes and evaluate their impacts on forests.},

	abstract = {Populations of red oak borer, Enaphalodes rufulus (Haldeman), a native wood-boring beetle, seem to be at unprecedented levels that are coinciding with extensive oak mortality occurring in the Ozark Mountains of Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Missouri. To quantify population levels, we developed intensive and extensive sampling methods with respect to the seasonal phenology of active and quiescent stages of the borer’s synchronous 2-yr life cycle. Intensive whole-tree sampling yields data for the entire infested tree bole and provides baseline data for development of less time-consuming sampling methods. Extensive partial-tree sampling uses a nine-sample proportional sampling scheme to estimate densities, which are extrapolated to the whole tree. Data comparison reveals extensive estimates and intensive data are not significantly different, thus verifying extensive sampling as a relatively accurate and acceptable sampling method. Preliminary data from 58 trees confirm epidemic population levels in three areas of the Ozark National Forest in northern Arkansas. Mean number of phloem galleries initiated by current generation larvae on 38 trees was 599 ± 50 (SE) per tree, average number of live red oak borer found in 57 trees was 77 ± 15 per tree, and mean number of previous generation heartwood galleries present in 38 trees was 185 ± 30. Data generated through this research will permit detailed studies of red oak borer biology and mortality, facilitate development of less time-consuming field sampling techniques, and set the stage for further study of factors contributing to the current outbreak and associated tree mortality.},

	abstract = {Senescence (an increase in the mortality rate or force of mortality, or a decrease in fertility, with increasing age) is a widespread phenomenon. Theories about the evolution of senescence have long focused on the age trajectories of the selection gradients on mortality and fertility. In purely age-classified models, these selection gradients are non-increasing with age, implying that traits expressed early in life have a greater impact on fitness than traits expressed later in life. This pattern leads inevitably to the evolution of senescence if there are trade-offs between early and late performance. It has long been suspected that the stage- or size-dependent demography typical of plants might change these conclusions. In this paper, we develop a model that includes both stage- and age-dependence and derive the age-dependent, stage-dependent and age×stage-dependent selection gradients on mortality and fertility. We applied this model to stage-classified population projection matrices for 36 species of plants, from a wide variety of growth forms (from mosses to trees) and habitats. We found that the age-specific selection gradients within a life cycle stage can exhibit increases with age (we call these contra-senescent selection gradients). In later stages, often large size classes in plant demography, the duration of these contra-senescent gradients can exceed the life expectancy by several fold. Synthesis. The interaction of age- and stage-dependence in plants leads to selection pressures on senescence fundamentally different from those found in previous, age-classified theories. This result may explain the observation that large plants seem less subject to senescence than most kinds of animals. The methods presented here can lead to improved analysis of both age-dependent and stage-dependent demographic properties of plant populations.},

	abstract = {Worldwide tree plantations face prolonged drought periods that are predicted to increase in duration and intensity under climate change scenarios. Trees stressed by drought are susceptible to secondary stressors including pests and pathogens. Depending on the timing and intensity of these stressors, their impact may be persistent or acute, with varied temporal and spatial responses by different hosts. There are complex processes involved in tree performance and mortality, and often it can be difficult to identify the leading cause of growth decline and death. However, it is important to recognise that often death can be a gradual process with periods of recovery. While previous models have focussed on the decline of the tree in response to stress, there has been little focus on the recovery from stress. Hence, the development here of the Tree Decline Recovery Seesaw model. This conceptual model is based on the premise that drought stressed trees may alternate between different stages of health through time, particularly those facing intermittent drought over extended periods. This approach takes into account that recovery periods allow for the tree to regain health, and potentially create new opportunities for pest and disease outbreaks. The Tree Decline Recovery Seesaw model provides researchers with the understanding of the complexity of drought/pest/pathogen interactions, allowing them to assess the order and severity of the stressors to determine the likely outcome. This paper provides a vital step towards the development of predictive tools for plantation managers. While our model has focussed on eucalypt plantation trees, there is potential to apply the model to other tree species and forms of plant stress.},

	abstract = {Maple syrup production is both an economically and culturally important industry in the northeastern U.S., and the commercial harvest of the temperature-sensitive sap has occurred for several centuries. A significant decline in maple syrup yield has been associated with warming spring temperatures during the critical sugaring period, and increases in summer drought frequencies. What is unknown, however, is how this current decline compares within the range of variability expected for a broader range of crops. Few sugar maple tree-ring chronologies from the northeastern U.S. exist, yet the potential utility of this species is high. This project will be the first to incorporate and employ dendrochronological techniques to develop maple syrup yield reconstructions. This project is designed to investigate correlations between statewide tree growth and maple syrup production using data collected from multiple sites in New York State and determine if these relationships can be modeled to reconstruction historical yields. Thus, this project will help promote the effectiveness of using tree-ring data to predict agricultural yields, which will ultimately provide farmers additional information about crop yield cycles. This knowledge will in turn help determine appropriate management methods for sugarbush operators during less optimal climatological conditions.},

Series Humiles) have changed from the last glacial maximum to the present. The macrofossil maps corroborate patterns shown by the isopoll maps and provide spatial detail and taxonomic resolution. The macrofossils confirm the inference from pollen data that unglaciated southeastern North America was cooler during the last glacial maximum (18 and 15 ka) than simulated by the COHMAP experiments with the NCAR CCM0 general circulation model. The geographic distribution of macrofossil occurrences during the Late glacial (12 and 9 ka) indicate that migration lag of boreal species did not occur at regional to subcontinental scales, and that pollen assemblages lacking modern analogs resulted from climate gradients lacking modern analogs. Early Holocene (9 and 6 ka) macrofossil maps show rapid northward expansion of tree species ranges into deglaciated regions. The data also show modest contractions of northern range limits of temperate species and expansions of southern range limits of boreal species in response to cooling trends during the late Holocene (3 and 0 ka). Comparison of modern macrofossil maps of nine of these taxa with corresponding range maps confirm that the macrofossils record the geographic ranges accurately. Comparison of the modern macrofossil maps with maps of tree growing-stock volume shows that for some taxa ( Abies, Tsuga) macrofossil occurrences were most frequent in regions of maximum tree abundance. Comparison of modern isopoll maps with the modern range and growing-stock volume maps indicate that, in contrast to the macrofossil data, the pollen data provide poorer resolution of range limits for most taxa, but better indications of abundance maxima and minima within the ranges.},

	abstract = {The presence of radiatively active gases in the Earth's atmosphere (water vapor, carbon dioxide, and ozone) raises its global mean surface temperature by 30 K, making our planet habitable by life as we know it. There has been an increase in carbon dioxide and other trace gases since the Industrial Revolution, largely as a result of man's activities, increasing the radiative heating of the troposphere and surface by about 2 W m−2. This heating is likely to be enhanced by resulting changes in water vapor, snow and sea ice, and cloud. The associated equilibrium temperature rise is estimated to be between 1 and 2 K, there being uncertainties in the strength of climate feedbacks, particularly those due to cloud. The large thermal inertia of the oceans will slow the rate of warming, so that the expected temperature rise will be smaller than the equilibrium rise. This increases the uncertainty in the expected warming to date, with estimates ranging from less than 0.5 K to over 1 K. The observed increase of 0.5 K since 1900 is consistent with the lower range of these estimates, but the variability in the observed record is such that one cannot necessarily conclude that the observed temperature change is due to increases in trace gases. The prediction of changes in temperature over the next 50 years depends on assumptions concerning future changes in trace gas concentrations, the sensitivity of climate, and the effective thermal inertia of the oceans. On the basis of our current understanding a further warming of at least 1 K seems likely. Numerical models of climate indicate that the changes will not be uniform, nor will they be confined to temperature. The simulated warming is largest in high latitudes in winter and smallest over sea ice in summer, with little seasonal variation in the tropics. Annual mean precipitation and runoff increase in high latitudes, and most simulations indicate a drier land surface in northern mid-latitudes in summer. The agreement between different models is much better for temperature than for changes in the hydrological cycle. Priorities for future research include developing an improved representation of cloud in numerical models, obtaining a better understanding of vertical mixing in the deep ocean, and determining the inherent variability of the ocean-atmosphere system. Progress in these areas should enable detection of a man-made “greenhouse” warming within the next two decades.},

At the continental scale, climate plays a major role in determining plant distribution, while at the local and regional scales vegetation patterns are more strongly related to edaphic and topographic factors. The projected global warming and alteration of the precipitation regime will influence tree physiology and phenology, and is likely to promote northward migration of tree species. However the influence of soil characteristics on tree species migration is not as well understood. Considering the broad tolerance of most tree species to variations in soil factors, soils should not represent a major constraint for the northward shift of tree species. However, locally or regionally, soil properties may constrain species migration. Thus, while climate change has the potential to induce a northward migration of tree species, local or regional soil properties may hinder their migratory response. These antagonistic forces are likely to slow down potential tree migration in response to climate change. Because tree species respond individualistically to climate variables and soil properties, new tree communities are likely to emerge from climate change.},

The structure of CLM(ED) and the physiological and structural modifications applied to the CLM are presented. A major motivation of this development is to allow the prediction of biome boundaries directly from plant physiological traits via their competitive interactions. Here we investigate the performance of the model for an example biome boundary in eastern North America. We explore the sensitivity of the predicted biome boundaries and ecosystem properties to the variation of leaf properties using the parameter space defined by the GLOPNET global leaf trait database. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of four sequential alterations to the structural assumptions in the model governing the relative carbon economy of deciduous and evergreen plants. The default assumption is that the costs and benefits of deciduous vs. evergreen leaf strategies, in terms of carbon assimilation and expenditure, can reproduce the geographical structure of biome boundaries and ecosystem functioning. We find some support for this assumption, but only under particular combinations of model traits and structural assumptions. Many questions remain regarding the preferred methods for deployment of plant trait information in land surface models. In some cases, plant traits might best be closely linked to each other, but we also find support for direct linkages to environmental conditions. We advocate intensified study of the costs and benefits of plant life history strategies in different environments and the increased use of parametric and structural ensembles in the development and analysis of complex vegetation models.},

A major unknown in this work is the extent to which populations of trees will actually track climate shifts through migration. We therefore present two extreme scenarios in which species either move entirely into future climatic niches or do not move out of their current niches. In the full-dispersal scenario, future potential ranges show decreases and increases in size, with an average decrease of 12\% and a northward shift of 700 kilometers (km). In the no-dispersal scenario, potential ranges decrease in size by 58\% and shift northward by 330 km. Major redistribution pressures appear to be in order under both dispersal scenarios.},

We aimed to quantify changes in projected ranges and threat level by the years 2061–2080, for 12 European forest tree species under three climate change scenarios. We combined tree distribution data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, EUFORGEN, and forest inventories, and we developed species distribution models using MaxEnt and 19 bioclimatic variables. Models were developed for three climate change scenarios—optimistic (RCP2.6), moderate (RCP4.5), and pessimistic (RPC8.5)—using three General Circulation Models, for the period 2061–2080. Our study revealed different responses of tree species to projected climate change. The species may be divided into three groups: “winners”—mostly late-successional species: Abies alba, Fagus sylvatica, Fraxinus excelsior, Quercus robur, and Quercus petraea; “losers”—mostly pioneer species: Betula pendula, Larix decidua, Picea abies, and Pinus sylvestris; and alien species—Pseudotsuga menziesii, Quercus rubra, and Robinia pseudoacacia, which may be also considered as “winners.” Assuming limited migration, most of the species studied would face a significant decrease in suitable habitat area. The threat level was highest for species that currently have the northernmost distribution centers. Ecological consequences of the projected range contractions would be serious for both forest management and nature conservation.},

However, forest ecosystems are highly sensitive to climate change. The effect of rapidly changing precipitation and temperature patterns on tree species is of concern as these long-lived organisms cannot quickly adapt to the new environmental conditions in which they find themselves. As temperatures increase it is expected that there will be a change in species' ranges poleward. This study uses Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) and Geographic Information System (GIS) weighted sum analysis to project near future (2050) and distant future (2100) suitability maps of sugar maple (Acer saccharum) habitat in Ontario associated with three different Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) scenarios. Our maps project an overall decrease in the amount of suitable habitat within the current sugar maple range under the scenarios modelled, which intensifies in the later time period. Furthermore there is a projected shift in central and southern Ontario from a region dominated by suitable habitat to one dominated by unsuitable habitat.},

	abstract = {Given the rate of projected environmental change for the 21st century, urgent adaptation and mitigation measures are required to slow down the on-going erosion of biodiversity. Even though increasing evidence shows that recent human-induced environmental changes have already triggered species’ range shifts, changes in phenology and species’ extinctions, accurate projections of species’ responses to future environmental changes are more difficult to ascertain. This is problematic, since there is a growing awareness of the need to adopt proactive conservation planning measures using forecasts of species’ responses to future environmental changes. There is a substantial body of literature describing and assessing the impacts of various scenarios of climate and land-use change on species’ distributions. Model predictions include a wide range of assumptions and limitations that are widely acknowledged but compromise their use for developing reliable adaptation and mitigation strategies for biodiversity. Indeed, amongst the most used models, few, if any, explicitly deal with migration processes, the dynamics of population at the “trailing edge” of shifting populations, species’ interactions and the interaction between the effects of climate and land-use. In this review, we propose two main avenues to progress the understanding and prediction of the different processes occurring on the leading and trailing edge of the species’ distribution in response to any global change phenomena. Deliberately focusing on plant species, we first explore the different ways to incorporate species’ migration in the existing modelling approaches, given data and knowledge limitations and the dual effects of climate and land-use factors. Secondly, we explore the mechanisms and processes happening at the trailing edge of a shifting species’ distribution and how to implement them into a modelling approach. We finally conclude this review with clear guidelines on how such modelling improvements will benefit conservation strategies in a changing world.},

Thus, understanding fungal community dynamics within dead wood is crucial to understanding decomposition and carbon cycling. Mycelia compete for wood territory, by employing antagonistic mechanisms involving changes in morphology, and production of volatile and diffusible chemicals. This is metabolically costly, and may affect the rate of use of the resource. The metabolic rate during pairwise interactions between wood decay ascomycetes and basidiomycetes was determined by measuring CO2 production. CO2 evolution altered over time, but changes were combination-specific. In only two combinations – when the dominant competitor overgrew the opponent's territory as mycelia cords – did CO2 evolution increase over the course of the whole interaction. In most interactions, CO2 evolution increased only after complete replacement of one competitor, suggesting utilisation of the predecessor mycelium or differences in decay ability due to alteration of the resource by the predecessor. There was no relationship between rate of CO2 evolution and combative ability nor outcome of interaction.},

Fungicolous fungi have a constant but indeterminate association with another fungus, and it can be difficult to demonstrate a true parasitic relationship. Mycoparasitic relationships can be necrotrophic or biotrophic, and can be classified on the basis of the host–parasite interface as contact necrotrophs, invasive necrotrophs, haustorial biotrophs, intracellular biotrophs, or fusion biotrophs depending on the intimacy of the relationship. In natural ecosystems, it is proposed that mycoparasitic relationships play an important role in the development of fungal communities. Two specific examples have been chosen to illustrate the general principles of mycoparasitism: the necrotrophic invasion of spores of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and the biotrophic invasion of mucoralean hosts by haustorial mycoparasites.

	abstract = {Decomposer fungi continually deplete the organic resources they inhabit, so successful colonization of new resources is a crucial part of their ecology. Colonization success can be split into (i) the ability to arrive at, gain entry into, and establish within a resource and (ii) the ability to persist within the resource until reproduction and dissemination. Fungi vary in their life history strategies, the three main drivers of which are stress (S-selected), disturbance (ruderal, or R-selected), and incidence of competitors (C-selected); however, fungi often have combinations of characteristics from different strategies. Arrival at a new resource may occur as spores or mycelium, with successful entry and establishment (primary resource capture) within the resource largely dependent on the enzymatic ability of the fungus. The communities that develop in a newly available resource depend on environmental conditions and, in particular, the levels of abiotic stress present (e.g., high temperature, low water availability). Community change occurs when these initial colonizers are replaced by species that are either more combative (secondary resource capture) or better able to tolerate conditions within the resource, either through changing abiotic conditions or due to modification of the resource by the initial colonizers. Competition for territory may involve highly specialized species-specific interactions such as mycoparasitism or may be more general; in both cases combat involves changes in morphology, metabolism, and reactive oxygen species production, and outcomes of these interactions can be altered under different environmental conditions. In summary, community development is not a simple ordered sequence, but a complex ever-changing mosaic.},

The importance of bacterial–fungal interactions (BFI) in environmental science, medicine and biotechnology has led to the emergence of a dynamic and multidisciplinary research field that combines highly diverse approaches including molecular biology, genomics, geochemistry, chemical and microbial ecology, biophysics and ecological modelling. In this review, we discuss recent advances that underscore the roles of BFI across relevant habitats and ecosystems. A particular focus is placed on the understanding of BFI within complex microbial communities and in regard of the metaorganism concept. We also discuss recent discoveries that clarify the (molecular) mechanisms involved in bacterial–fungal relationships, and the contribution of new technologies to decipher generic principles of BFI in terms of physical associations and molecular dialogues. Finally, we discuss future directions for research in order to stimulate synergy within the BFI research area and to resolve outstanding questions.},

	abstract = {Interspecific competition in natural plant communities is highly dependent on nutrient availability. At high levels of nutrient availability, competition is mainly for light. As light is a unidirectional resource, high-nutrient habitats are dominated by fast-growing perennials with a tall stature and a rather uniform vertical distribution of leaf area. Moreover, these species have high turnover rates of leaves and roots and a high morphological plasticity during the differentiation of leaves. There is less consensus, however, about the importance and intensity of interspecific competition in nutrient-poor environments. It is argued that selection in nutrient-poor habitats is not necessarily on a high competitive ability for nutrients and a high growth rate, but rather on traits which reduce nutrient losses (low tissue nutrient concentrations, slow tissue turnover rates, high nutrient resorption efficiency). Due to evolutionary trade-offs plants can not maximize both growth rate and nutrient retention. Thus, the low growth rate of species from nutrient-poor habitats should be considered as the consequence of nutrient retention rather than as a feature on which direct selection takes place. The contrasting traits of species from nutrient-poor and nutrient-rich habitats mutually exclude them from each others' habitats. Moreover, these traits have severe consequences for litter decomposability and thereby also for nutrient cycling. This leads both in nutrient-poor and nutrient-rich habitats to a positive feedback between plant species dominance and nutrient availability, thereby promoting ecosystem stability.},

Competition drives community development in decaying woody resources, with interactions occurring at a distance, following physical contact, and through specialised relationships such as mycoparasitism. Outcomes of combative interactions range from replacement, where one mycelium displaces another, to deadlock, where neither combatant captures territory from the other; and a spectrum of intermediate outcomes (i.e. partial or mutual replacement) lie between these extremes. Many wood decay basidiomycetes coexist within a resource, in a complex and dynamic community, and new research techniques are focussing on spatial orientation of interactions in 3 dimensions, as opposed to historical two-dimensional research. Not only do interactions drive changes in species composition and thus wood decomposition rate, they also may have industrial applications in biocontrol of pathogenic or nuisance fungi, enzyme production, and in the production of novel antifungals and antibiotics. Altogether, fungal interactions are a fascinating and important field of study.},

	abstract = {Increased atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition could create an imbalance between N and phosphorus (P), which may substantially impact ecosystem functioning. Changes in autumnal phenology (i.e., leaf senescence) and associated leaf nutrient resorption may profoundly impact plant fitness and productivity. However, we know little about how and to what extent nutrient addition affects leaf senescence in tree species, or how changes in senescence may influence resorption. We thus investigated the impacts of N and P addition on leaf senescence and leaf N resorption in 2-year-old larch (Larix principisrupprechtii) seedlings in northern China. Results showed that nutrient addition (i.e., N, P or N + P addition) significantly delayed autumnal leaf senescence, and decreased leaf N resorption efficiency (NRE) and proficiency (NRP), particularly in the N and N + P treatments. Improved leaf N concentrations were correlated with delayed leaf senescence, as indicated by the positive relationship between mature leaf N concentrations and the timing of leaf senescence. Following nutrient addition, larch seedlings shifted toward delayed onset, but more rapid, leaf senescence. Additionally, we observed an initial negative correlation between the timing of leaf senescence and NRE and NRP, followed by a positive correlation, indicating delayed and less efficient remobilization during the early stages of senescence, followed by accelerated resorption in the later stages. However, the latter effect was potentially impaired by the increased risk of early autumn frost damage, thus failed to fully compensate for the negative effects observed during the early stages of senescence. Improved soil P availability increased leaf N resorption and thus weakened the negative impact of delayed leaf senescence on leaf N resorption, so P addition had no significant impact on leaf N resorption. Overall, our findings clarify the relationship between nutrient addition–resorption and the linkage with leaf senescence, and would have important implications for plant nutrient conservation strategy and nutrient cycling.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change has altered temperate forest phenology, but how these trends will play out in the future is controversial. We measured the effect of experimental warming of 0.6–5.0 °C on the phenology of a diverse suite of 11 plant species in the deciduous forest understory (Duke Forest, North Carolina, USA) in a relatively warm year (2011) and a colder year (2013). Our primary goal was to dissect how temperature affects timing of spring budburst, flowering, and autumn leaf coloring for functional groups with different growth habits, phenological niches, and xylem anatomy. Warming advanced budburst of six deciduous woody species by 5–15 days and delayed leaf coloring by 18–21 days, resulting in an extension of the growing season by as much as 20–29 days. Spring temperature accumulation was strongly correlated with budburst date, but temperature alone cannot explain the diverse budburst responses observed among plant functional types. Ring-porous trees showed a consistent temperature response pattern across years, suggesting these species are sensitive to photoperiod. Conversely, diffuse-porous species responded differently between years, suggesting winter chilling may be more important in regulating budburst. Budburst of the ring-porous Quercus alba responded nonlinearly to warming, suggesting evolutionary constraints may limit changes in phenology, and therefore productivity, in the future. Warming caused a divergence in flowering times among species in the forest community, resulting in a longer flowering season by 10-16 days. Temperature was a good predictor of flowering for only four of the seven species studied here. Observations of interannual temperature variability overpredicted flowering responses in spring-blooming species, relative to our warming experiment, and did not consistently predict even the direction of flowering shifts. Experiments that push temperatures beyond historic variation are indispensable for improving predictions of future changes in phenology.},

Taking the case of population dynamics, I point out that there are several very general law-like propositions that provide the theoretical basis for most population dynamics models that were developed to address specific issues. Some of these foundational principles, like the law of exponential growth, are logically very similar to certain laws of physics (Newton's law of inertia, for example, is almost a direct analogue of exponential growth). I discuss two other principles (population self-limitation and resource-consumer oscillations), as well as the more elementary postulates that underlie them. None of the “laws” that I propose for population ecology are new. Collectively ecologists have been using these general principles in guiding development of their models and experiments since the days of Lotka, Volterra, and Gause.},

Amid this vast body of work, is it possible to build one general theory of ecological communities? What other scientific areas might serve as a guiding framework? As it turns out, the core focus of community ecology-understanding patterns of diversity and composition of biological variants across space and time-is shared by evolutionary biology and its very coherent conceptual framework, population genetics theory.{\textless}em{\textgreater}The Theory of Ecological Communities{\textless}/em{\textgreater}takes this as a starting point to pull together community ecology's various perspectives into a more unified whole.  Mark Vellend builds a theory of ecological communities based on four overarching processes: selection among species, drift, dispersal, and speciation. These are analogues of the four central processes in population genetics theory-selection within species, drift, gene flow, and mutation-and together they subsume almost all of the many dozens of more specific models built to describe the dynamics of communities of interacting species. The result is a theory that allows the effects of many low-level processes, such as competition, facilitation, predation, disturbance, stress, succession, colonization, and local extinction to be understood as the underpinnings of high-level processes with widely applicable consequences for ecological communities.  Reframing the numerous existing ideas in community ecology,{\textless}em{\textgreater}The Theory of Ecological Communities{\textless}/em{\textgreater}provides a new way for thinking about biological composition and diversity.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims Many individual studies have shown that the timing of leaf senescence in boreal and temperate deciduous forests in the northern hemisphere is influenced by rising temperatures, but there is limited consensus on the magnitude, direction and spatial extent of this relationship.Methods A meta-analysis was conducted of published studies from the peer-reviewed literature that reported autumn senescence dates for deciduous trees in the northern hemisphere, encompassing 64 publications with observations ranging from 1931 to 2010.Key Results Among the meteorological measurements examined, October temperatures were the strongest predictors of date of senescence, followed by cooling degree-days, latitude, photoperiod and, lastly, total monthly precipitation, although the strength of the relationships differed between high- and low-latitude sites. Autumn leaf senescence has been significantly more delayed at low (25° to 49°N) than high (50° to 70°N) latitudes across the northern hemisphere, with senescence across high-latitude sites more sensitive to the effects of photoperiod and low-latitude sites more sensitive to the effects of temperature. Delays in leaf senescence over time were stronger in North America compared with Europe and Asia.Conclusions The results indicate that leaf senescence has been delayed over time and in response to temperature, although low-latitude sites show significantly stronger delays in senescence over time than high-latitude sites. While temperature alone may be a reasonable predictor of the date of leaf senescence when examining a broad suite of sites, it is important to consider that temperature-induced changes in senescence at high-latitude sites are likely to be constrained by the influence of photoperiod. Ecosystem-level differences in the mechanisms that control the timing of leaf senescence may affect both plant community interactions and ecosystem carbon storage as global temperatures increase over the next century.},

	abstract = {Plant phenology, the annually recurring sequence of plant developmental stages, is important for plant functioning and ecosystem services and their biophysical and biogeochemical feedbacks to the climate system. Plant phenology depends on temperature, and the current rapid climate change has revived interest in understanding and modeling the responses of plant phenology to the warming trend and the consequences thereof for ecosystems. Here, we review recent progresses in plant phenology and its interactions with climate change. Focusing on the start (leaf unfolding) and end (leaf coloring) of plant growing seasons, we show that the recent rapid expansion in ground- and remote sensing- based phenology data acquisition has been highly beneficial and has supported major advances in plant phenology research. Studies using multiple data sources and methods generally agree on the trends of advanced leaf unfolding and delayed leaf coloring due to climate change, yet these trends appear to have decelerated or even reversed in recent years. Our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the plant phenology responses to climate warming is still limited. The interactions between multiple drivers complicate the modeling and prediction of plant phenology changes. Furthermore, changes in plant phenology have important implications for ecosystem carbon cycles and ecosystem feedbacks to climate, yet the quantification of such impacts remains challenging. We suggest that future studies should primarily focus on using new observation tools to improve the understanding of tropical plant phenology, on improving process-based phenology modeling, and on the scaling of phenology from species to landscape-level.},

	abstract = {Global climate change impacts can already be tracked in many physical and biological systems; in particular, terrestrial ecosystems provide a consistent picture of observed changes. One of the preferred indicators is phenology, the science of natural recurring events, as their recorded dates provide a high-temporal resolution of ongoing changes. Thus, numerous analyses have demonstrated an earlier onset of spring events for mid and higher latitudes and a lengthening of the growing season. However, published single-site or single-species studies are particularly open to suspicion of being biased towards predominantly reporting climate change-induced impacts. No comprehensive study or meta-analysis has so far examined the possible lack of evidence for changes or shifts at sites where no temperature change is observed. We used an enormous systematic phenological network data set of more than 125 000 observational series of 542 plant and 19 animal species in 21 European countries (1971–2000). Our results showed that 78\% of all leafing, flowering and fruiting records advanced (30\% significantly) and only 3\% were significantly delayed, whereas the signal of leaf colouring/fall is ambiguous. We conclude that previously published results of phenological changes were not biased by reporting or publication predisposition: the average advance of spring/summer was 2.5 days decade−1 in Europe. Our analysis of 254 mean national time series undoubtedly demonstrates that species' phenology is responsive to temperature of the preceding months (mean advance of spring/summer by 2.5 days°C−1, delay of leaf colouring and fall by 1.0 day°C−1). The pattern of observed change in spring efficiently matches measured national warming across 19 European countries (correlation coefficient r=−0.69, P{\textless}0.001).},

	abstract = {Spring ephemerals of deciduous forest are adapted to take advantage of the high-light period available in early spring. They appear shortly after snow melt and complete their aboveground growth, including fruit production, within 2 months. After they produce new buds, they senesce and enter dormancy. Dormancy is not very deep in spring ephemerals and during summer differentiation occurs in the bud of the apparently resting organ. Low soil temperatures release dormancy, and the shoots and roots then grow slowly over autumn and winter. The goal of this paper is to show how this characteristic phenology influences many aspects of spring ephemerals’ physiology, and the influences these different physiological parameters have on each other. Spring ephemerals have high photosynthetic rates that allow them to rapidly accumulate carbohydrates and complete their aboveground growth in a few weeks. To sustain high photosynthetic rates in early spring, the plants must be able to absorb water efficiently at low soil temperatures and to allocate large amounts of nutrients to the shoot to compensate for lower enzymatic activity at low temperatures. Nutrients are mainly absorbed in spring, although the root system is established in autumn. This means that a large amount of both carbohydrates and nutrients is translocated from the perennial organ to the developing shoot starting in autumn through early spring. Spring ephemerals have low nutrient absorption rates, but high resorption efficiency during leaf senescence. Nevertheless, their high nutrient needs restrict them to rich forest soils. The annual growth rate of spring ephemerals is very slow and this is more likely related to the inherent slow growth rate of the perennial organ than to their short leaf life. As soon as carbohydrate reserves are replenished in spring, sink limitation apparently builds up and induces leaf senescence. A better understanding of the factors controlling the growth rate of spring ephemerals is needed before we can predict these plants’ response to climatic changes.},

	abstract = {Boreal forest ecosystems are adapted to periodic disturbance, but there is widespread concern that conventional forest practises degrade plant communities. We examined vegetation diversity and composition after clearcut logging, mechanical and chemical site preparation in eight 5- to 12-yr old studies located in southern boreal forests of British Columbia and Quebec, Canada to find useful indicators for monitoring ecosystem integrity and to provide recommendations for the development and testing of new silvicultural approaches. Community-wide and species-specific responses were measured across gradients of disturbance severity and the results were explained in terms of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis and a simple regeneration model based on plant life history strategies. Species richness was 30 to 35\% higher 5 to 8 years after clearcut logging than in old forest. Total and vascular species diversity generally peaked on moderately severe site treatments, while non-vascular diversity declined with increasing disturbance severity. On more-or-less mesic sites, there was little evidence of diversity loss within the range of conventional silvicultural disturbances; however, there were important changes in plant community composition. Removing soil organic layers caused a shift from residual and resprouting understory species to ruderal species regenerating from seeds and spores. Severe treatments dramatically increased non-native species invasion. Two important challenges for the proposed natural dynamics-based silviculture will be 1) to find ways of maintaining populations of sensitive non-vascular species and forest mycoheterotrophs, and 2) to create regeneration niches for disturbance-dependent indigenous plants without accelerating non-native species invasion.},

	abstract = {It is acknowledged that natural forest fires cannot and even should not be eliminated from the North American boreal forest. Forest fires produce immediate losses of wood volume, disrupt the conversion of the actual forest age structure into a target structure, and prevent planned timber supply (PTS) levels from being achieved. In this paper, we explore the extent to which periodic shortfalls in available timber under various burn rates can be mitigated through salvage logging and the tolerance of forest managers to a given level of shortfall, both as a function of forest age class structure. Simulations are done using both a deterministic and a stochastic representation of burn rate over time. Results show that the frequency of shortfall events can be reduced by salvage logging and by the introduction of measures that generate a tolerance to shortfall and that this mitigation potential is influenced by initial forest age class structure and burn rate. Results also show that even a 100\% rate of salvage logging cannot fully compensate for timber losses to fire and eliminate fire-induced timber shortfalls. Furthermore, interannual burn rate variability reduces the efficiency of both mitigation measures. As the PTS is never realized under fire risk, the real cost of opting for different PTS scenarios should be estimated not from the difference in PTS but rather from the more realistic difference in realized timber harvest.},

	abstract = {Many boreal populations of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) have declined in Canada, a trend essentially driven by the increasing footprint of anthropogenic disturbances and the resulting habitat-mediated apparent competition that increases predation pressure. However, the influence of climate change on these ecological processes remains poorly understood. We evaluated how climate change will affect boreal caribou habitat over the 2030–2100 horizon and in a 9.94 Mha study area, using a climate-sensitive simulation ensemble that integrates climate-induced changes in stand dynamics, fire regime, and different levels of commercial timber harvesting. We assessed the relative importance of these three drivers under projections made using different radiative forcing scenarios (RCP 2.6, 4.5, 8.5). Habitat quality was estimated from resource selection functions built with telemetry data collected from 121 caribou between 2004 and 2011 in 7 local populations. At the beginning of our simulations, caribou habitat was already structured along a south-to-north increasing quality gradient. Simulations revealed changes in forest cover that are driven by climate-induced variations in fire regime and scenarios of harvesting levels, resulting in the loss of older coniferous forests and an increase in deciduous stands. These changes induced a generalized decrease in the average habitat quality and in the percentage of high-quality habitat for caribou, and in a northward recession of suitable habitat. Timber harvesting was the most important agent of change for the 2030–2050 horizon, although it was slowly replaced by changes in fire regime until 2100. Our results clearly showed that it is possible to maintain the current average habitat quality for caribou in future scenarios that consider a reduction in harvested volumes, the only lever under our control. This suggests that we still have the capacity to conciliate socioeconomic development and caribou conservation imperatives in the face of climate change, an important issue debated throughout the species distribution range.},

	abstract = {A significant challenge of conservation biology is to preserve species in places where their critical habitat also attracts significant economic interest. The problem is compounded when species distributions occur across large spatial extents. Threatened boreal caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) epitomize this problem: their critical habitat encompasses a vast expanse of forest that also supplies much of Canada’s merchantable timber. Boreal caribou were protected under the Canada Species at Risk Act in 2003. We investigated putative drivers of reduced disturbance for caribou habitat since then. Where the cumulative logging footprint slowed within caribou habitat, this has resulted neither from decreases in annual allowable cut of timber nor the creation or expansion of protected areas. Rather, it has fluctuated with the American economy relative to that of Canada. For each \$0.05 US lost over the \$CAD, 129 km2 of caribou habitat was not disturbed by logging in a given year. Recent population declines have been occurring even though logging typically remained at {\textless}70\% of allowed levels. Our study raises concerns about how caribou are functionally being conserved under the current application of existing legislation. In this globalized world, the economy of foreign nations is increasingly likely to govern national conservation objectives.},

	abstract = {Conflicts between economic development and conservation are increasingly hampering efforts to restore imperiled wildlife populations. Public opinion can influence how these conflicts translate into conservation actions, encouraging stakeholders to express their views through various public channels. The outcome of these campaigns typically remains unknown. Via an online survey, we collected to the opinion of 1000 citizens of Québec, Canada, regarding the ongoing conflict between logging and the conservation of at-risk caribou populations (Rangifer tarandus). We found that people expect conservation actions that are sufficient to recover caribou populations, even if millions of government investment are required and jobs are lost in the process. When respondents learned that academic caribou researchers indicated that the two management strategies being studied by government would be insufficient for population recovery, one-third withdrew their support for either strategy. Age, gender and education all explain variation in public opinion, but it was the region of residence that most consistently explained variation in opinion. Residents of caribou-inhabited regions were less concerned about caribou conservation and more supportive of forestry than residents of other regions, reflecting regional differences in expected economic impacts of conservation, not negative interactions with caribou. In fact, most people supported strong conservation actions for the recovery of caribou populations, regardless of their socio-demographics. Our analysis provides general insights into how public opinion on the trade-off between conservation and economy is influenced by socio-demographics and scientific conclusions. We found that current government conservation actions (or lack thereof) are not in line with mainstream public opinion. Moreover, we show that making species at-risk lists does not ensure that the species will benefit from strong conservation actions without lengthy delays, even for a high-profile, flagship species like caribou. This observation echoes concerns about the fate of less charismatic, at-risk species, and thus about future biodiversity conservation efforts.},

	abstract = {Decades of expansion of industrial resource extraction in boreal forests have resulted in the legacy of thousands of kilometers of linear features (seismic lines, forest roads) that have fragmented several wildlife habitats. The decommissioning of anthropogenic linear features and the restoration of suitable habitat are top priorities for the recovery of several species at risk, among which, the threatened populations of boreal caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou). However, the decommissioning of linear features found in caribou range is expensive, and determining which characteristics make them more beneficial to caribou predators and competitors could assist in prioritizing those that may be most critical for boreal caribou habitat restoration. We thus aimed to determine how fine-scale forest road characteristics influence their use by gray wolf (Canis lupus), black bear (Ursus americanus), moose (Alces americanus) and caribou. We used camera traps and generalized linear mixed models to test the effect of road-scale characteristics on the use of forest roads by wolves, bears and moose while also considering larger-scale covariates. Wolves had a greater probability of using roads that were surrounded by wetlands and had a low lateral cover density. For bears, the intensity of use was lower on 20+ year-old roads when compared to 0–10-year-old roads, and higher on roads surrounded by coniferous stands. Moose intensity of use was higher on 11–20-year-old roads and lower on 30+ year-old roads, and decreased on roads surrounded by clearcuts and with a lower number of deciduous stems growing on them. We could not test for caribou use as we did not capture enough events. Nevertheless, by showing which forest roads are more used by caribou predators (wolves and bears) and its apparent competitor (moose), our study highlights the importance of considering both road-scale characteristics and the landscape context in which roads are built to prioritize the most detrimental roads to caribou conservation and guide efficient restoration efforts of its habitat.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic disturbances have been demonstrated to affect animal behavior, distribution, and abundance, but assessment of their impacts on fitness-related traits has received little attention. We hypothesized that human activities and infrastructure cause a decrease in the individual performance of preys because of anthropogenically enhanced predation risk. We evaluated the impacts of commercial logging and road networks on the fitness of a large herbivore known to be sensitive to human disturbance: the forest-dwelling woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou). For 8 consecutive years (2004–2011) we monitored 59 individuals using GPS telemetry in the Charlevoix region of Québec, Canada. We also used Very High Frequency telemetry locations collected on 28 individuals from 1999–2000. We related habitat selection of adult caribou at various spatio-temporal scales to their probability of dying from predation, and to indices of their reproductive success and energy expenditure. The probability that adult caribou died from predation increased with the proportion of recent disturbances (including cutblocks ≤5 years old) in their annual home range. The respective effects of increasing paved and forestry road densities depended upon the overall road density within the home range of caribou. At a finer scale of 10 to 15 days before their death, caribou that were killed by a predator selected for recent disturbances more than individuals that survived, and avoided old mature conifer stands. The home range area of caribou increased with road density. Finally, the composition of the home range of females had no effect on their reproductive success. We show that human activities and infrastructure may influence the individual performance of large prey species in highly managed regions. We outline the need to consider the full set of impacts that human development may have on threatened animal populations, with particular emphasis on predator-prey relationships and population dynamics.},

	abstract = {Conserving species-at-risk requires quantifiable knowledge of the key drivers of population change. Non-linear demographic responses to habitat loss have been documented for many species and may serve to establish quantitative habitat thresholds for management purposes. In Canada, boreal populations of woodland caribou are considered threatened; Environment Canada’s empirical model of calf recruitment–range disturbance suggests that at least 65\% undisturbed habitat is required to ensure viability. We tested the relationship upon which this conservation guideline is based by pairing demographic estimates with range conditions over a 10-year period for three boreal caribou populations. Our objectives were (1) to evaluate evidence of intra-population demographic responses to fluctuations in range quality over time; (2) to evaluate inter-population differences in demographic responses to cumulative range disturbances; and (3) to evaluate the sensitivity of disturbance tolerance thresholds to variation in local population demography. We found strong evidence in support of the disturbance–recruitment relationship for within-population responses over time (R2 = 0.77). Mixed effects logistic regression modeling revealed variations in local population responses to cumulative habitat depletion. Range-specific disturbance thresholds derived from Monte Carlo simulations were highly elastic in response to observed variation in local population demography, suggesting that 65\% undisturbed habitat is insufficient when adult female survival and/or sex ratio is suboptimal. Study populations were determined to be not self-sustaining (Pr(λ ≥ 0.99) = 37–47\%). Adult survival was comparable to estimates reported elsewhere despite Aboriginal harvesting for subsistence purposes. Results underscored potential trade-offs between forest harvesting and wildlife habitat conservation. Protection and restoration of sufficient quantities of undisturbed habitat, particularly via road reclamation, is essential for caribou population recovery.},

Anthropogenic activities have considerably increased nitrogen (N) deposition, which significant affects plant phenology. Although numerous individual studies have been conducted, it remains controversial how N addition affects phenological stages, and a comprehensive understanding of how plant phenology responds to external N inputs remains elusive. To reconcile the differences, we conducted a meta-analysis of 117 species to examine the responses of plant phenology to N addition in terrestrial ecosystems, and assessed variations in their responses in relation to ecosystem types, functional groups, and environmental conditions. Our results showed that plant phenology changed significantly after N addition, and phenology time delayed and phenology duration shortened significantly across all biomes except fruiting duration, but varied with biome types. The phenology change in cropland was more dramatical than in grassland after N addition, even in opposite directions. The response of phenological stages to N addition was consistent in two pollination types except the flowering time, the flowering time had no change in anemophilous but significantly delayed in entomophilous. In addition, the response of phenology to N addition was discrepancy among functional groups, the phenology time advanced and duration shortened in sedge, while phenology time delayed and duration shortened in other groups, and the phenology change in legume was larger than grass and forbs. We also found that environmental factors had little effects on the response of plant phenology to N addition, but significant correlation was found between the response ratios of different phenological stages. Our study suggested that phenology was sensitive to N deposition at many phenological stages, and changes in phenology may be smaller with community biodiversity increasing at ecosystem level.},

In this Review, we summarize these changes, their drivers and the resulting impacts. The start of the growing season advanced by 9.4 ± 2.2 days during 1982–1999 and 8.3 ± 2.0 days over 2000–2020, and the end of season delayed by 8.2 ± 1.9 days during 2000–2020. The main identified drivers of these changes are warming temperatures and increasing precipitation, but their impacts vary substantially across the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau. Other factors, such as grazing and nitrogen deposition, also potentially influence phenological changes, but these relationships are poorly constrained. In manipulation experiments, grazing and nitrogen addition have no individual effects on most phenophase timings at the population level, but nitrogen addition markedly delays flowering. Additionally, there are carry-over effects between phenophases that control subsequent temperature and precipitation responses. Phenological changes in turn could alter species interactions, modulate carbon and water cycling, and affect Asian monsoons and spring rainfall over eastern China, but evidence of these interactions is limited. Harmonization of remote-sensing-based and in situ observations, and simultaneous testing of both biotic and abiotic factors, are needed for a mechanistic understanding of Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau phenology dynamics.},

	abstract = {Effective species conservation efforts require insight into whether a species’ extent of occurrence may shift due to changing climate, habitat loss, or both. The extent of occurrence of the threatened boreal population of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou; caribou) has contracted due to environmental and anthropogenic disruption, with further contractions predicted as boreal habitat shifts with the changing climate. However, the direct and indirect climate drivers of caribou extent of occurrence have not been explicitly investigated. We estimated and compared the influence of climate and habitat drivers on the occurrence of caribou ranges across the Canadian boreal forest. We fit path models that estimated the direct effects of climate on caribou range occurrence and its indirect effect through climate's influence on caribou habitat (i.e., forest cover, presence of peatland, human disturbance and wildfire). Our analysis suggests that the distribution of caribou ranges is less sensitive to the direct effects of climate than to those of habitat and human disturbance. However, through its relationship to caribou habitat, climate exerts indirect influence over the distribution of caribou. As the climate changes, future distributions of caribou may be more heavily relegated to refuge habitats, particularly peatlands in the western boreal forest. Our biogeographical approach enables more informed decisions for large-scale caribou conservation efforts (e.g. establishment of protected areas, habitat restoration) that account for potential shifts in the distribution of caribou under changing environmental and climatic conditions.},

	abstract = {With the intensification of human activities, preserving animal populations is a contemporary challenge of critical importance. In this context, the umbrella species concept is appealing because preserving a single species should result in the protection of multiple co-o­ ccurring species. Practitioners, though, face the task of having to find suitable umbrellas to develop single-s­pecies management guidelines. In North America, boreal forests must be managed to facilitate the recovery of the threatened boreal caribou (Rangifer tarandus). Yet, the effect of caribou conservation on co-o­ ccurring animal species remains poorly documented. We tested if boreal caribou can constitute an effective umbrella for boreal fauna. Birds, small mammals, and insects were sampled along gradients of post-h­arvest and post-­fire forest succession. Predictive models of occupancy were developed from the responses of 95 species to characteristics of forest stands and their surroundings. We then assessed the similarity of species occupancy expected between simulated harvested landscapes and a 90 000-k­m2 uncut landscape. Managed landscapes were simulated based on three levels of disturbance, two timber-­ harvest rotation cycles, and dispersed or aggregated cut-b­ locks. We found that management guidelines that were more likely to maintain caribou populations should also better preserve animal assemblages. Relative to fragmentation or harvest cycle, we detected a stronger effect of habitat loss on species assemblages. Disturbing 22\%, 35\%, and 45\% of the landscape should result, respectively, in 80\%, 60\%, and 40\% probability for caribou populations to be sustainable; in turn, this should result in regional species assemblages with Jaccard similarity indices of 0.86, 0.79, and 0.74, respectively, relative to the uncut landscape. Our study thus demonstrates the value of single-s­ pecies management for animal conservation. Our quantitative approach allows for the evaluation of management guidelines prior to implementation, thereby providing a tool for establishing suitable compromises between economic and environmental sustainability of human activities.},

Infectious disease is a primary cause of death in this population. The protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii is reported in numerous marine mammal species, including beluga. In the present study, 55 tissue samples (heart and brain) collected from 34 stranded SLE beluga were analysed by PCR followed by DNA sequencing and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (RFLP) to determine the PCR prevalence and genotypes of T. gondii in these beluga. Of 34 beluga tested, 44\% were positive for T. gondii by PCR, with males having a higher prevalence of infection than females and with more infected neonates and juveniles than adults. Molecular analyses indicated that all T. gondii infecting stranded SLE beluga grouped into genotype II, which predominates in humans. While our results indicate that a high prevalence of stranded beluga are PCR-positive for T. gondii infection, very few deaths are attributed to toxoplasmosis based on published necropsy results. Toxoplasma gondii can cause a range of diseases, including neurological deficits, and more data are needed to investigate this parasite's effect on population recovery.},

	abstract = {The primary aim of the present study was to find an efficient and simple method of vegetative propagation for producing large numbers of hybrid aspen (Populus tremuloides L. x P. tremula Michx.) plants for forest plantations. The key objectives were to investigate the main physiological factors that affect the ability of cuttings to regenerate and to determine whether these factors could be manipulated by different growth conditions. In addition, clonal variation in traits related to propagation success was examined. According to our results, with the stem cutting method, depending on the clone, it is possible to obtain only 1−8 plants from one stock plant per year. With the root cutting method the corresponding values for two-year-old stock plants are 81−207 plants. The difference in number of cuttings between one- and two-yearold stock plants is so pronounced that it is economically feasible to grow stock plants for two years. There is no reason to use much older stock plants as a source of cuttings, as it has been observed that rooting ability diminishes as root diameter increases. Clonal variation is the most important individual factor in propagation of hybrid aspen. The fact that the efficiently sprouted clones also rooted best facilitates the selection of clones for large-scale propagation. In practice, root cuttings taken from all parts of the root system of hybrid aspen were capable of producing new shoots and roots. However, for efficient rooting it is important to use roots smaller than one centimeter in diameter. Both rooting and sprouting, as well as sprouting rate, were increased by high soil temperature; in our studies the highest temperature tested (30ºC) was the best. Light accelerated the sprouting of root cuttings, but they rooted best in dark conditions. Rooting is essential because without roots the sprouted cutting cannot survive long. For aspen the criteria for clone selection are primarily fiber qualities and growth rate, but ability to regenerate efficiently is also essential. For large-scale propagation it is very important to find clones from which many cuttings per stock plant can be obtained. In light of production costs, however, it is even more important that the regeneration ability of the produced cuttings be high.},

Adventitious rooting in different Populus clones has been an agronomic trait targeted in breeding programs for many years, and many factors have been identiﬁed that affect this quantitative trait. A huge variation in the rooting capacity has been observed among the species in the Populus genus, and the responses to some of the factors affecting this trait have been shown to be genotype-dependent. This review analyses similarities and differences between results obtained from studies examining the role of internal and external factors affecting rooting of Populus species cuttings. Since rooting is the most important requirement for stand establishment in clonally propagated species, understanding the physiological and genetic mechanisms that promote this trait is essential for successful commercial deployment.},

	abstract = {Alnus maritima (Marsh.) Nutt. (seaside alder) is a rare, woody-plant species with potential for use in managed landscapes. Information on the propagation and production of this species is not available. Our objective was to evaluate the use of softwood cuttings to propagate A. maritima, with emphasis on how indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), plant provenance, and time of collection affect cutting survival, rooting percentage, the number of roots produced, and their length. Propagation trials were conducted with cuttings from seven trees on the Delmarva Peninsula (Eastern Shore of Maryland and southern Delaware) and seven trees in Oklahoma. Cuttings from mature plants in both provenances were collected on 14 June and 23 Aug. 1998; wounded; treated with IBA at 0, 1, or 8 g·kg–1; and placed under intermittent mist in a greenhouse for 9 weeks. Use of IBA at 8 g·kg–1 caused a greater rooting percentage (68\%), root count (7.2), and root length (39.2 mm) than did the other IBA rates when applied to cuttings from Oklahoma in June, but IBA had little effect on cuttings from the Delmarva Peninsula. Across IBA treatments, rooting of cuttings from Oklahoma (55\% in June and 12\% in August) was greater than the rooting of cuttings from Delmarva (27\% in June and 3\% in August). Cuttings from Oklahoma had greater survival, callus development, root length, and root count than did cuttings from the Delmarva Peninsula during June and August trials. Averaged over IBA treatments and provenances, cuttings collected on 14 June rooted more frequently (41\%) than did cuttings collected 23 Aug. (8\%). We conclude that softwood cuttings from mature plants are an effective way to multiply clones of A. maritima, particularly when cuttings are collected early in the season and treated with IBA at 8 g·kg–1.},

Testing of newly developed cultivars informs assessment of potential planting stock for local environments. Initial rooting by nine poplar clones was tested in moist and saturated soil conditions during an 18-day greenhouse experiment. Clones responded differently to soil moisture, particularly in number of roots, root distribution, and root dry mass accumulation. About 73\% of cuttings planted in moist soil produced roots from callus tissue, whereas only 1\% of cuttings planted in saturated soil developed such roots. This drove root distribution towards the basal section of cuttings in moist soil, while in saturated soil roots were more evenly distributed among all three below-ground sections of cuttings. Roots originating from the basal section of cuttings planted in moist soil were longer than roots originating from apical and middle sections. Conversely, roots from the apical and middle sections of cuttings planted in saturated soil were longer than those originating from the basal section. Initial rooting among poplar clones established under two soil moisture regimes has implications for genotype deployment in the field, but long-term effects in the field are still unknown.},

This framework was mostly limited to quantitative traits without missing values and to situations in which there are more species than traits, although the authors had suggested a way to extend their framework to other trait types. The main purpose of this note is to further develop this suggestion. We describe a highly ﬂexible distance-based framework to measure different facets of FD in multidimensional trait space from any distance or dissimilarity measure, any number of traits, and from different trait types (i.e., quantitative, semi-quantitative, and qualitative). This new approach allows for missing trait values and the weighting of individual traits. We also present a new multidimensional FD index, called functional dispersion (FDis), which is closely related to Rao’s quadratic entropy. FDis is the multivariate analogue of the weighted mean absolute deviation (MAD), in which the weights are species relative abundances. For unweighted presence–absence data, FDis can be used for a formal statistical test of differences in FD. We provide the ‘‘FD’’ R language package to easily implement our distance-based FD framework.},

	abstract = {Linkage disequilibrium (LD) is the nonrandom association of alleles of different loci. There is no single best statistic that quantifies the extent of LD. Several statistics have been proposed that are useful for different purposes.Recombination interacts in a complex way with selection, mutation and genetic drift to determine levels of LD. As a consequence, local and genome-wide patterns of LD can provide insight into patterns of natural selection and the past history of population growth and dispersal.In humans and other model organisms, LD between marker alleles and traits of interest allow fine-scale gene mapping. Many recent genome-wide association studies have successfully mapped SNPs associated with complex inherited diseases in humans.Unusually high local LD can indicate an allele that has recently increased to high frequency under strong selection. Several methods have been developed to detect selected loci and to estimate the age of alleles using patterns of LD.In humans, the analysis of LD is well underway. The pace is slower in other species, although some model organisms, including mice, dogs, Drosophila and Arabidopsis thaliana, are catching up fast. Extensive analysis of LD in non-model species will be undertaken soon.},

In the first application of this multigenerational method, we estimated F and s for adults over three consecutive generations in adjacent populations of two annual Mimulus taxa: the outbreeding M. guttatus and the inbreeding M. platycalyx. This gave estimates of w for the last two generations. Although average multilocus selfing rates were high in both taxa (0.63 in M. guttatus; 0.84 in M. platycalyx), the relative fitness of selfed progeny averaged only 0.19 in M. guttatus and 0.32 in M. platycalyx. An alternative estimator for w that incorporates biparental inbreeding gave even lower estimates of w. These values are significantly below the 0.5 threshold thought to favor selfing, and show that partially selfing populations can harbor substantial genetic load. In accordance with the purging hypothesis, the more highly selfing M. platycalyx showed marginally lower inbreeding depression than M. guttatus in both years (P = 0.08). Inbreeding depression and selfing rates also varied among years in concert among taxa. Several sources of bias are discussed, but computer simulations indicate it is unlikely that w is biased downwards by linkage of marker loci to load loci.},

When complex traits are involved in local adaptation, phenomena such as phenotypic plasticity further hamper evolutionary biologists to study the complex relationships between phenotype, genotype and environment. In this perspective paper, we suggest that the common garden experiment, specifically designed to deal with phenotypic plasticity, has a clear role to play in the study of local adaptation, even (if not specifically) in the genomic era. After a quick review of some high-throughput genotyping protocols relevant in the context of a common garden, we explore how to improve common garden analyses with dense marker panel data and recent statistical methods. We then show how combining approaches from population genomics and genome-wide association studies with the settings of a common garden can yield to a very efficient, thorough and integrative study of local adaptation. Especially, evidence from genomic (for example, genome scan) and phenotypic origins constitute independent insights into the possibility of local adaptation scenarios, and genome-wide association studies in the context of a common garden experiment allow to decipher the genetic bases of adaptive traits.},

Factors such as yield, earliness, fiber properties, resistance to pests, stress resistance, and ease of management are conditioned by quantitative genes. Large amounts of additive genetic and general combining ability variances indicate continued progress in breeding for yield and fiber properties is likely to continue in cotton. The negative genetic correlation of yield and fiber strength has been overcome largely by intercrossing both within cross populations and by continuously adding new variability to the gene pool. Genetic associations between qualitative and quantitative traits are very evident in cotton. Aside from the gene action the phenotypic performance of a genotype is influenced by its environment. The relative magnitudes of the interaction, error, and genotypic components are useful in determining efficient methods of using time and resources in a breeding program.},

However, this often requires unrealistic assumptions of ancestral demography and selective regimes. Sequencing ancient DNA from temporally spaced samples can inform about past selection processes, as time series data allow direct quantification of population parameters collected before, during, and after genetic changes driven by selection. In this Comment and Opinion, we advocate for the inclusion of temporal sampling and the generation of paleogenomic datasets in evolutionary biology, and highlight some of the recent advances that have yet to be broadly applied by evolutionary biologists. In doing so, we consider the expected signatures of balancing, purifying, and positive selection in time series data, and detail how this can advance our understanding of the chronology and tempo of genomic change driven by selection. However, we also recognize the limitations of such data, which can suffer from postmortem damage, fragmentation, low coverage, and typically low sample size. We therefore highlight the many assumptions and considerations associated with analyzing paleogenomic data and the assumptions associated with analytical methods.},

We ﬁrst investigate issues related to its deﬁnition as a set of local communities that are linked by dispersal of multiple potentially interacting species. We then identify four paradigms for metacommunities: the patch-dynamic view, the species-sorting view, the mass effects view and the neutral view, that each emphasizes different processes of potential importance in metacommunities. These have somewhat distinct intellectual histories and we discuss elements related to their potential future synthesis. We then use this framework to discuss why the concept is useful in modifying existing ecological thinking and illustrate this with a number of both theoretical and empirical examples. As ecologists strive to understand increasingly complex mechanisms and strive to work across multiple scales of spatio-temporal organization, concepts like the metacommunity can provide important insights that frequently contrast with those that would be obtained with more conventional approaches based on local communities alone.},

	abstract = {Community ecology is often perceived as a “mess,” given the seemingly vast number of processes that can underlie the many patterns of interest, and the apparent uniqueness of each study system. However, at the most general level, patterns in the composition and diversity of species—the subject matter of community ecology—are inﬂuenced by only four classes of process: selection, drift, speciation, and dispersal. Selection represents deterministic ﬁtness differences among species, drift represents stochastic changes in species abundance, speciation creates new species, and dispersal is the movement of organisms across space. All theoretical and conceptual models in community ecology can be understood with respect to their emphasis on these four processes. Empirical evidence exists for all of these processes and many of their interactions, with a predominance of studies on selection. Organizing the material of community ecology according to this framework can clarify the essential similarities and differences among the many conceptual and theoretical approaches to the discipline, and it can also allow for the articulation of a very general theory of community dynamics: species are added to communities via speciation and dispersal, and the relative abundances of these species are then shaped by drift and selection, as well as ongoing dispersal, to drive community dynamics.},

	abstract = {Consensus has emerged in the literature that increased biodiversity enhances the capacity of ecosystems to perform multiple functions. However, most biodiversity/ecosystem function studies focus on a single ecosystem, or on landscapes of homogenous ecosystems. Here, we investigate how increased landscape-level environmental dissimilarity may affect the relationship between different metrics of diversity (a, b, or c) and ecosystem function. We produced a suite of simulated landscapes, each of which contained four experimental outdoor aquatic mesocosms. Differences in temperature and nutrient conditions of the mesocosms allowed us to simulate landscapes containing a range of within-landscape environmental heterogeneities. We found that the variation in ecosystem functions was primarily controlled by environmental conditions, with diversity metrics accounting for a smaller (but significant) amount of variation in function. When landscapes were more homogeneous, a, b, and c diversity was not associated with differences in primary production, and only c was associated with changes in decomposition. In these homogeneous landscapes, differences in these two ecosystem functions were most strongly related to nutrient and temperature conditions in the ecosystems. However, as landscape-level environmental dissimilarity increased, the relationship between a, b, or c and ecosystem functions strengthened, with b being a greater predictor of variation in decomposition at the highest levels of environmental dissimilarity than a or c. We propose that when all ecosystems in a landscape have similar environmental conditions, species sorting is likely to generate a single community composition that is well suited to those environmental conditions, b is low, and the efficiency of diversity-ecosystem function couplings is similar across communities. Under this low b, the effect of abiotic conditions on ecosystem function will be most apparent. However, when environmental conditions vary among ecosystems, species sorting pressures are different among ecosystems, producing different communities among locations in a landscape. These conditions lead to stronger relationships between b and the magnitude of ecosystem functions. Our results illustrate that abiotic conditions and the homogeneity of communities influence ecosystem function expressed at the landscape scale.},

However, the degree to which local adaptation is affected by the spatial and temporal scale of environmental variation is poorly understood. A multiyear reciprocal transplant experiment was performed with populations of the annual plant Leptosiphon parviﬂorus living on adjacent serpentine and nonserpentine soil. Local adaptation over this small geographic scale was observed, but there were differences in the temporal variability of selection across habitats. On serpentine soil, the local population had a consistently large survival advantage, presumably as a result of the temporal stability in selection imposed by soil cation content. In contrast, a fecundity advantage was observed for the sandstone population on its native soil type but only in the two study years with the highest rainfall. A manipulative greenhouse experiment demonstrated that the ﬁtness advantage of the sandstone population in its native soil type depends critically on water availability. The temporal variability in local adaptation driven by variation in precipitation suggests that continued drought conditions have the potential to erode local adaptation in these populations. These results show how different selective factors can inﬂuence spatial and temporal patterns of variation in ﬁtness trade-offs.},

Our sites of mixed deciduous coniferous forest in north-central BC, Canada, support a rich diversity of eight species of primary cavity nesters (PCNs) (woodpeckers), four species of weak cavity nesters (nuthatch, chickadees) and 20 secondary cavity-nesting species (ducks, passerines and birds of prey). Richness varied across forest-types with some plots being `hotspots' and others being depauperate. Across a range of forest-types, we measured species richness and abundance of birds and squirrels using point count census techniques, playbacks of taped calls of woodpeckers and owls, and by searching for active nests. We also measured resource use (trees able to support cavities, or existing cavities) in relation to availability (tree species, abundance and habitat characteristics such as edge-type and degree of fragmentation). In both 1995 and 1996, we found significant positive correlations between the abundance of primary and secondary cavity-nesting birds, and negative correlations between both of these groups and weak cavity excavators. None of the three cavity-nesting groups was positively correlated with open-nesting (non-cavity) forest birds, rejecting our null hypothesis of common habitat quality. In contrast, the abundance of secondary cavity-nesting species was significantly negatively correlated with non-cavity species, possibly because these species compete for resources other than nest sites, such as invertebrate prey. Using these data, we construct a nest web for the cavity-nesting community in north-central British Columbia. This approach demonstrated strong and weak links among species in the web and identified key species whose presence may be critical to the integrity of the community. We plan to test how nest web structure shifts in response to different forest-cutting regimes, and whether changes in species richness and abundance can be ameliorated with selective harvesting.},

Our current understand-ing of the pathways and network of interactions among multiple invasive species within whole communities is limited. Eradication efforts often focus on a single target species, potentially leading to unexpected outcomes on interacting non-target species. We aimed to examine the interaction network in a cavity-nesting community consisting of native and invasive birds. We studied the nesting cavities in the largest urban park in Israel over two breeding seasons. We found evidence for a complex interaction network that includes negative, neutral and positive interactions, but no synergistic positive interactions among aliens. Three major factors shaped the interaction network: breeding timing, nesting preferences and the ability to excavate or widen the cavities, which were found to be a limited resource. Cavity enlargement by the early-breeding invasive rose-ringed parakeet may enhance breeding of the invasive common myna in previously unavailable holes. The myna excludes the smaller invasive vinous-breasted starling, a direct competitor of the primary nest excavator, the native Syrian woodpecker. Therefore, management and eradication efforts directed towards the common myna alone may actually release the vinous-breasted starling from competitive exclusion by the common myna, increas-ing the negative impact of the vinous-breasted starling on the native community. As found here, interactions among multiple alien species can be crucial in shaping invasion success and should be carefully considered when aiming to effectively manage biological invasions.},

	abstract = {Reproductive success usually declines in the course of the season, which may be a direct effect of breeding time, an effect of quality (individuals with high phenotypic or environmental quality breeding early), or a combination of the two. Being able to distinguish between these possibilities is crucial when trying to understand individual variation in annual routines, for instance when to breed, moult and migrate. We review experiments with free-living birds performed to distinguish between the ‘timing’ and ‘quality’ hypothesis. ‘Clean’ manipulation of breeding time seems impossible, and we therefore discuss strong and weak points of different manipulation techniques. We find that the qualitative results were independent of manipulation technique (inducing replacement clutches versus cross-fostering early and late clutches). Given that the two techniques differ strongly in demands made on the birds, this suggests that potential experimental biases are limited. Overall, the evidence indicated that date and quality are both important, depending on fitness component and species, although evidence for the date hypothesis was found more frequently. We expected both effects to be prevalent, since only if date per se is important, does an incentive exist for high-quality birds to breed early. We discuss mechanisms mediating the seasonal decline in reproductive success, and distinguish between effects of absolute date and relative date, for instance timing relative to seasonal environmental fluctuations or conspecifics. The latter is important at least in some cases, suggesting that the optimal breeding time may be frequency dependent, but this has been little studied. A recurring pattern among cross-fostering studies was that delay experiments provided evidence for the quality hypothesis, while advance experiments provided evidence for the date hypothesis. This indicates that late pairs are constrained from producing a clutch earlier in the season, presumably by the fitness costs this would entail. This provides us with a paradox: evidence for the date hypothesis leads us to conclude that quality is important for the ability to breed early.},

Since natural selection so strongly favours parents who leave many surviving young, the question arises as to why other birds breed later than the date at which they could most successfully raise their young.
It is suggested that the food supply for the breeding females immediately prior to the breeding season may limit their ability to form eggs and the females may thus not be able to lay at the time which would result in young being in the nest at the best time for raising them, but as soon after this time as the female is able to produce her eggs. Not all species are likely to be prevented, by food shortage, from breeding at the best time for raising young and the groups of birds most likely to be affected are discussed.},

	abstract = {The phenotypic cues that provide for rejection of non-nestmates by workers of the ant genus Camponotus could derive from any or all of four sources: (1) environmental odors; (2) the individual's own genetically-determined recognition pheromones or "discriminators"; (3) a "gestalt" or mixture of transferable discriminators, produced by each nestmate and absorbed by all; and/or (4) the discriminators of the queen applied to all nestmates. To test these hypotheses, four series of small experimental colonies were created: inter- and intraspecific mixed colonies containing queens, queenless worker groups, and pairs of worker groups between which a single queen was repeatedly switched. Intraspecific mixed colonies and queenless groups were further divided into groups receiving different diets. Aggression of workers in 165 experimental colonies was assayed in a total of 4064 neutral arena tests. Workers adopted into inter- and intraspecific mixed colonies with queens were highly aggressive to unfamiliar kin from pure colonies, independent of diet and of the proportion of different kin groups in the colony. However, queenless workers exhibited less aggression to unfamiliar kin than to non-kin, demonstrating the existence of worker discriminators. Diet differences slightly enhanced aggression among unfamiliar queenless kin. Non-kin sharing a switched queen were as unaggressive to one another as were sisters. The ability to adopt queenless workers between colonies gradually declined over 1-2 wks following their emergence from pupae. We propose a hierarchy of importance of cue sources in determining nestmate discrimination in small Camponotus colonies: Queen discriminators{\textgreater}worker discriminators{\textgreater}environmental cues. A flow-diagram model of social insect kin recognition, based on the "phenotype matching" concept of Holmes and Sherman (1983), is discussed.},

It is, however, unclear how we should interpret these shifts without some sort of a yardstick: a measure that will reflect how much a species should be shifting to match the change in its environment caused by climate change. Here, we assume that the shift in the phenology of a species' food abundance is, by a first approximation, an appropriate yardstick. We review the few examples that are available, ranging from birds to marine plankton. In almost all of these examples, the phenology of the focal species shifts either too little (five out of 11) or too much (three out of 11) compared to the yardstick. Thus, many species are becoming mistimed due to climate change. We urge researchers with long-term datasets on phenology to link their data with those that may serve as a yardstick, because documentation of the incidence of climate change-induced mistiming is crucial in assessing the impact of global climate change on the natural world.},

	abstract = {L’importance des forêts matures et âgées pour le maintien de la biodiversité est irréfutable. En raison de leur utilisation marquée du bois mort et des arbres sénescents pour l’excavation de leurs cavités de nidification et leur alimentation, les espèces cavicoles sont particulièrement sensibles à la perte de ce type d’habitat. Parmi ces espèces, le Grand Pic (Dryocopus pileatus) est une espèce de choix pour orienter les standards d’aménagement forestiers, détenant le statut d’espèce indicatrice de la forêt mature, espèce clé de voute et parapluie, en raison de son impact positif sur la faune alternatifs en cas de perturbation et contiennent également une bonne disponibilité d’arbres propices à son alimentation. Ainsi, les peuplements matures à forte concentration de peupliers faux-trembles s’avèrent d’une importance capitale dans l’occupation du territoire chez cette espèce. Les orientations d’aménagement forestier durable devraient donc se baser sur une vision à long terme ciblant davantage le maintien dans le paysage d’une plus forte proportion de peuplements mixtes âgés de peupliers fauxtrembles sénescents et d’arbres matures de conifères (sapin baumier, épinette blanche) pour la nidification du Grand Pic, leur nombre ayant déjà été grandement diminué en raison des systèmes d’aménagement forestier équienne basés principalement sur les pratiques de coupes avec protection de la régénération et des sols (CPRS) qui ces dernières décennies ont rajeuni passablement le couvert forestier diminuant d’autant les vieilles forêts mixtes dans la portion sud de la forêt boréale.utilisatrice des grandes cavités, cavités qu’il creuse chaque année. Pour mieux comprendre l’écologie de cette espèce, la présente étude a pour premier objectif de définir les concepts et enjeux associés aux processus de sélection d’habitats, avec un accent sur l’échelle du domaine vital, et de dresser par la suite un portrait d’ensemble de la sélection d’habitats faite par le Grand Pic à différentes échelles spatiales en forêt boréale mixte du Nord-ouest du Québec. Elle a pour second objectif d’évaluer comment la répartition des sites de nidification du Grand Pic est associée à la distribution des arbres de nidification et d’alimentation dans les peuplements forestiers de la forêt boréale mixte du Nord-ouest du Québec. Pour ce faire, un modèle empirique de la qualité de l’habitat des peuplements forestiers de la forêt boréale mixte a été élaboré en mettant en relation les informations des cartes numériques écoforestières, les inventaires forestiers du ministère des Forêts de la Faune et des Parcs du Québec et l’important jeu de données empiriques des arbres d’alimentation et de reproduction du Grand Pic répertoriés lors des recensements de la faune cavicole dans notre secteur d’étude ces derniers 15 ans. Ce modèle a été utilisé pour comparer la proportion des peuplements propices à la reproduction du Grand Pic de 30 sites de nidification connus à l’intérieur d’un domaine vital estimé de 500 hectares à celle de 30 sites de même superficie distribués aléatoirement dans l’aire d’étude. De plus, dans les 30 sites de nidification de Grand Pic, la répartition des proportions de peuplements forestiers en fonction de la densité estimée des tiges propices à la reproduction a été comparée selon trois zones concentriques en périphérie des nids, soit à proximité (soit de 0 à 166 ha), à une distance intermédiaire (soit de 167 à 334 ha) et éloignée du site de nidifications (soit de 335 à 500 ha). Enfin, un échantillonnage sur le terrain de la densité de tiges adéquates pour l’alimentation et la nidification de l’espèce a été réalisé dans 250 placettes distribuées de manière systématique dans des zones de 500 hectares autour de 5 sites de nidification actifs en 2020. Pour l’ensemble de la région à l’étude, nos analyses ont révélé qu’à l’échelle de la mosaïque forestière (65 200 ha) les secteurs du territoire abritant une cavité de reproduction de Grand Pic étaient répartis dans des paysages dont les peuplements adjacents contenaient des densités plus élevées d’arbres pouvant abriter une cavité de reproduction que les secteurs aléatoires. À l’échelle des domaines d’activités du Grand Pic (500 ha) centrés sur les 30 sites de nidification répertoriés depuis 2003, la proportion de peuplements forestiers de qualité élevée (avec un fort nombre estimé de tiges propices à la reproduction) était plus élevée à proximité des nids (premier rayon de 728 mètres) qu’à distance de ces derniers. Enfin, dans les cinq sites de reproduction actifs en 2020, nos inventaires systématiques ont montré des densité effectives des tiges propices à la nidification et à l’alimentation du Grand Pic plus élevées à proximité du nid, venant confirmer le rôle clé des arbres de reproduction et d’alimentation dans la répartition spatiale de la sélection des sites de nidification du Grand Pic dans notre aire d’étude. Ces résultats montrent que la localisation des nids de Grand Pic (sélection de troisième ordre; Johnson, 1980) est fortement associée à une sélection fine de peuplements forestiers à forte concentration d’arbres pouvant accueillir des cavités et des arbres d’alimentation (sélection de quatrième ordre; Johnson, 1980). Ils montrent aussi qu’à l’intérieur des domaines d’activités des couples nicheurs actifs, les concentrations d’arbres propices à la reproduction et à l’alimentation sont des variables clés pour l’établissement de leur territoire. Les avantages des peuplements mixtes matures sont nombreux pour le Grand Pic. Ils peuvent permettre à un couple d’occuper un territoire durant plusieurs années, offrent des sites de nidification alternatifs en cas de perturbation et contiennent également une bonne disponibilité d’arbres propices à son alimentation. Ainsi, les peuplements matures à forte concentration de peupliers faux-trembles s’avèrent d’une importance capitale dans l’occupation du territoire chez cette espèce. Les orientations d’aménagement forestier durable devraient donc se baser sur une vision à long terme ciblant davantage le maintien dans le paysage d’une plus forte proportion de peuplements mixtes âgés de peupliers faux-trembles sénescents et d’arbres matures de conifères (sapin baumier, épinette blanche) pour la nidification du Grand Pic, leur nombre ayant déjà été grandement diminué en raison des systèmes d’aménagement forestier équienne basés principalement sur les pratiques de coupes avec protection de la régénération et des sols (CPRS) qui ces dernières décennies ont rajeuni passablement le couvert forestier diminuant d’autant les vieilles forêts mixtes dans la portion sud de la forêt boréale.

Conservation efforts aimed at cavity‐using communities have often focused on woodpeckers because, as cavity excavators, they are presumed to control cavity supply. We show that avian excavators are the primary cavity producers in North America (77\% of nesting cavities), but not elsewhere (26\% in Eurasia and South America; 0\% in Australasia). We studied survivorship of 2805 nest cavities and found similar persistence of cavities created by woodpeckers and those created by decay in Canada, but low persistence of woodpecker‐excavated cavities in Poland and Argentina. Outside of North America, the ephemeral nature of many woodpecker cavities may render most cavity‐using vertebrates critically dependent on the slow formation of cavities by damage and decay. The future of most cavity‐using communities will therefore be highly dependent on changing forest policies to stem the current loss of old trees.},

	abstract = {Old boreal forests are considered quality habitats for birds associated with decaying and dead trees. However, the quantity and quality of these structural attributes in old forest stands are likely to be influenced by important latitudinal changes in tree species composition and productivity from the southern boreal mixed to the northern coniferous forests. We measured habitat occupancy of cavity and bark nesting birds in old forests when the boreal forest landscape shifts from a mixed to a dominant coniferous matrix in the Clay Belt of Québec and Ontario, a region where paludification dominates. Using playback calls, songs, and recent woodpeckers’ foraging signs on trees, we measured the occurrence and foraging habitat use of 11 bird species associated with deadwood in 86 unmanaged forest stands along a forest age gradient in both mixed and coniferous stands. In coniferous stands dominated by black spruce, deadwood birds showed a modal distribution in response to the aging of black spruce forests that reached a peak in stands of 160years and then declined. Unproductive paludified stands, which made up more than 40\% of our study area, were associated with a significantly lower species richness of deadwood birds. At the opposite, although they represented less than 4\% of the forest cover in our study area, old boreal mixedwood forests ({\textgreater}90years) were highly utilized habitats by deadwood birds. Structural diversity of trees (diversity of degradation stages and diameter of trees) was the variable that best explained species richness of this functional group of birds whereas at the individual species level, the quantity and quality of dead trees (degradation and size) in stands best explained species occurrence and abundance of foraging signs. Conservation efforts for deadwood birds should focus on old productive stands of both mixed and coniferous composition. However, our study pinpoints old mixedwood stand as habitats of special concern given their disproportionate importance for deadwood birds in northern boreal forests.},

	abstract = {Climate change, including directional shifts in weather averages and extremes and increased interannual weather variation, is influencing demography and distributions for many bird species. The Ouachita Mountains ecoregion in southeast Oklahoma and west-central Arkansas contains 2 populations of the Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Dryobates borealis, RCW), a federally endangered, cooperatively breeding species. Since this region is at the RCW’s northwestern range periphery, ecological thresholds likely are limiting for the species. Therefore, populations in this region may be more sensitive to climate change-associated weather variation and unpredictability. We used 26 years of nesting data (1991–2016) from the 2 RCW populations to determine if interannual weather variation has affected nesting phenology and productivity. For each population, we used daily temperature and precipitation data for 3 periods (30 and 60 days before nesting; 40 days overlapping the nesting period) to determine how weather influences median nesting date and average clutch size and numbers of fledglings. In a separate analysis, we used shorter time windows with individual nests as replicates to determine how discrete weather events (e.g., minimum and maximum temperatures and intense precipitation events) affect nest success and partial brood loss. For both Oklahoma and Arkansas populations, warmer early spring temperatures generally advanced nesting and increased clutch size and fledgling number. However, the effects of average precipitation varied depending on the amount and duration of precipitation in different time periods. At the nest level, most variables reflecting discrete temperature and precipitation events were unrelated to nest success and brood loss, suggesting that factors other than weather (e.g., habitat quality and predation) more strongly influenced the nesting output of individual RCW broods. Our results indicate RCWs are responding to interannual weather variation in complex and variable ways. However, warming trends may generally be having positive effects on the species at the northwestern edge of its range.• Climate change is influencing distributions and demography for many bird species. Understanding effects on populations at the edge of species’ ranges will be crucial for adapting management to prevent climate-caused declines and extinctions.• For the endangered Red-cockaded Woodpecker, we used 26 years of nest monitoring data to evaluate how interannual climate variation has affected nesting timing and productivity at the northwestern edge of the species’ range.• Warmer temperatures in early spring generally advanced Red-cockaded Woodpecker nesting dates and increased nest productivity. Precipitation effects were variable, depending on the amount and duration of rainfall in different time periods before and during the nesting season.• Although climate effects on Red-cockaded Woodpecker nesting ecology appear complex, conditions may be changing in ways that increase nest productivity at the northwestern edge of the species’ range. Managing habitat in this part of the range may become increasingly important to Red-cockaded Woodpecker conservation as climate change continues.},

It is the largest woodpecker in this region and the only species that forages primarily by excavating; only pileateds are capable of creating large cavities in hard snags and decadent live trees. A wide array of species, including many that are of management concern in the Pacific Northwest, use old pileated nest and roost cavities. In addition, pileateds provide foraging opportunities for other species, accelerate decay processes and nutrient cycling, and may facilitate inoculation by heart-rot fungi and mediate insect outbreaks. Because of the potential keystone role of pileated woodpeckers in Pacific Northwest forests, it may be appropriate to give special attention to their habitat needs in forest management plans and monitoring activities.},

	abstract = {Optimal reproductive performance occurs when birds time reproduction to coincide with peak food availability. Deviation from optimal timing, or mismatch, can affect productivity, though birds may mediate some mismatch effects by altering their incubation behavior. We studied the consequences of nesting timing (i.e., clutch initiation relative to an index of spring start) on productivity across the breeding range of American kestrels (Falco sparverius) in the United States and southern Canada, and associations between nesting timing, incubation behavior, and hatching asynchrony. We used observations from long-term nest box monitoring, remote trail cameras, and community-scientist-based programs to obtain data on clutch initiation, productivity, incubation, and hatching synchrony. Kestrels that initiated clutches after the extended spring index (SI-x, start of spring estimate) had higher rates of nest failure and fewer nestlings than earlier nesters, and effects of nesting timing on productivity were strongest in the Northeast. In contrast, kestrels in the Southwest experienced a more gradual decline in productivity across the season. Spatial effects may be the result of regional differences in growing seasons and temporal nesting windows (duration of nesting season). Specifically, resource availability in the Northeast was highly peaked during the breeding season, potentially resulting in shorter nesting windows. Conversely, resource curves were more prolonged in the Southwest, and growing seasons are becoming longer with climate change, potentially resulting in longer nesting windows. We found an inverse relationship between nesting timing and the onset of male incubation. Males from breeding pairs that initiated clutches after SI-x began incubation sooner than males from breeding pairs that initiated clutches before SI-x. Early-onset of male incubation was positively associated with hatching asynchrony, creating increased age variation in developing young. In sum, nesting phenology relative to the SI-x has consequences for American kestrels’ productivity, and these consequences vary across space. The early onset of incubation may act as a potential adaptive behavior to advance the average hatch date and spread out energetic demands. Given the effects of nesting timing on productivity, kestrels are likely to be sensitive to climate-driven advances in growing seasons and vulnerable to phenological mismatch, particularly in the Northeast.},

	abstract = {Many studies in recent years have demonstrated long-term temporal trends in biological parameters that can only be explained by climate change. Bird phenology has received great attention, as it studies one of the most conspicuous, popular, and easily observable phenomena in nature. There are many studies of long-term changes in spring arrival dates, most of which concur with earlier records from the last few decades. However, few data are available for autumn departures or length of stays. Furthermore, existing data offer an equivocal picture. In this study, we analysed a huge database of about 44 000 records for five trans-Saharan bird species (Ciconia ciconia, Cuculus canorus, Apus apus, Hirundo rustica and Luscinia megarhynchos). Data were collected from over 1300 sites around Spain during the period 1944–2004. Common spring arrival patterns were found in all species. Spring arrival dates have tended to advance since the mid-1970s. Current dates are similar to those from the 1940s (except for C. ciconia). Thus, the advance of spring migration over the last three decades could be seen as a return to the initial timing of arrival dates, after abnormally delayed arrivals during the 1970s. A strong negative relationship with temperature in Spain at arrival time was observed in all species. A negative relationship with the Sahel Index (a measurement of precipitation in the African Sahel area during the rainy season) for the previous year was also found in C. canorus, A. apus and H. rustica. Regarding autumn departures, all species showed common interdecadal fluctuations, but only H. rustica is leaving earlier Spain at present. All species departed earlier in years that had higher temperatures during their reproductive period. However, only for H. rustica the relation between Spanish temperatures at departure time and the last sightings of individuals was significant. A heterogeneous temporal response for the length of stay was also found: C. ciconia increased, A. apus did not change and H. rustica decreased its stay. This is the first study, based on an extensive bird phenology observational network covering a large region, that shows the most complete and thorough analysis available for the Mediterranean region.},

	abstract = {Structural complexity generated by forest development processes and tree species compositional changes provide key habitat features for vertebrate communities that rely upon tree size and decay processes for foraging, denning or nesting. Complexity of forest structure in old stands could not only be key for harboring increased taxonomic species diversity but also greater functional diversity through more complexity in networks of tree cavity dependent species. Using a nest web approach that hierarchically links cavity-bearing trees with cavity formation agents (natural decay processes and avian excavators) and cavity users (non-excavator species), we compared network characteristics of nest webs along a time since fire gradient in a naturally disturbed boreal mixedwood forest landscape in eastern North America. Since 2003, twelve 24 to 40 ha plots ranging from 61 to more than 245 years after fire were surveyed at the Lake Duparquet Research and Teaching Forest in Abitibi, Quebec, Canada to detect active nesting, and denning cavities. We found that network complexity both in terms of number of vertebrate species and number of interactions among species, increased along the age gradient and was significantly higher in the older stands than predicted by chance. Whereas cavity-nesting communities in old forests used a higher diversity of tree species over a wide range of decay stages, trembling aspen remained a key cavity-bearing tree throughout the age gradient. Woodpeckers were the main cavity formation agents whereas less than 1\% of cavities originated from natural decay. The structural development of older forests is thus a driver for functional diversity in cavity-using vertebrate communities through higher interaction richness in nest webs, among cavity-bearing trees, excavators and non-excavating users. The pivotal contribution of the entire gradient of old forest cover types to the overall complexity of nest webs in the boreal mixedwood zone is also a key for the resilience of the cavity-using vertebrate community to natural disturbances. We discuss how such resilience may be compromised by even-aged industrial timber harvesting with short rotations that shifts the age structure of boreal landscapes toward regenerating and young pole forests whereas old forest cover types become below their historical range of variability.},

            Weather and ecological factors are known to influence breeding phenology and thus individual fitness. We predicted concordance between weather conditions and annual variation in phenology within a community of eight resident, cavity-nesting bird species over a 17-year period. We show that, although clutch initiation dates for six of our eight species are correlated with local daily maximum temperatures, this common driver does not produce a high degree of breeding synchrony due to species-specific responses to conditions during different periods of the preceding winter or spring. These “critical temperature periods” were positively associated with average lay date for each species, although the interval between critical periods and clutch initiation varied from 4–78 days. The ecological factors we examined (cavity availability and a food pulse) had an additional influence on timing in only one of our eight focal species. Our results have strong implications for understanding heterogeneous wildlife responses to climate change: divergent responses would be expected within communities where species respond to local conditions within different temporal windows, due to differing warming trends between winter and spring. Our system therefore indicates that climate change could alter relative breeding phenology among sympatric species in temperate ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Alien plant species are stressors to ecosystems and indicators of reduced ecosystem integrity. The magnitude of the stress reflects not only the quantity of aliens present, but also the quality of their interactions with native ecosystems. We develop an Index of Alien Impact (IAI) to estimate the collective ecological impact of in situ alien species. IAI summarizes the frequency of occurrence and potential ecological impact (Invasiveness-Impact Score (Ii)) of individual alien species for all aliens present in a particular location or community type. A component metric, Ii, is based on ecological species traits (life history, ecological amplitude, and ability to alter ecosystem processes) that reflect mechanisms, which can increase impact to ecosystem structure and function. While Iiis less complex than some other multi-metric rankings of alien impact, it compares well to these metrics and to qualitative judgments. IAI can be adapted for different ecological settings by modifying the set of species traits incorporated in Iito reflect properties likely to breach biotic and abiotic barriers or alter ecosystem function in a particular region or community type of interest. To demonstrate our approach, we created versions of IAI and Ii, applicable to the diverse streamside vegetation of a river basin (19,631 km2) spanning low-elevation arid to mesic montane habitats in eastern Oregon, USA. In this demonstration effort, we (1) evaluate relationships of IAI to metrics describing invasion level, and (2) illustrate the potential utility of IAI for prioritizing alien species management activities and informing restoration goals.},

	abstract = {Few invaded ecosystems are free from habitat loss and disturbance, leading to uncertainty whether dominant invasive species are driving community change or are passengers along for the environmental ride. The “driver” model predicts that invaded communities are highly interactive, with subordinate native species being limited or excluded by competition from the exotic dominants. The “passenger” model predicts that invaded communities are primarily structured by noninteractive factors (environmental change, dispersal limitation) that are less constraining on the exotics, which thus dominate. We tested these alternative hypotheses in an invaded, fragmented, and fire-suppressed oak savanna. We examined the impact of two invasive dominant perennial grasses on community structure using a reduction (mowing of aboveground biomass) and removal (weeding of above- and belowground biomass) experiment conducted at different seasons and soil depths. We examined the relative importance of competition vs. dispersal limitation with experimental seed additions. Competition by the dominants limits the abundance and reproduction of many native and exotic species based on their increased performance with removals and mowing. The treatments resulted in increased light availability and bare soil; soil moisture and N were unaffected. Although competition was limiting for some, 36 of 79 species did not respond to the treatments or declined in the absence of grass cover. Seed additions revealed that some subordinates are dispersal limited; competition alone was insufficient to explain their rarity even though it does exacerbate dispersal inefficiencies by lowering reproduction. While the net effects of the dominants were negative, their presence restricted woody plants, facilitated seedling survival with moderate disturbance (i.e., treatments applied in the fall), or was not the primary limiting factor for the occurrence of some species. Finally, the species most functionally distinct from the dominants (forbs, woody plants) responded most significantly to the treatments. This suggests that relative abundance is determined more by trade-offs relating to environmental conditions (long-term fire suppression) than to traits relating to resource capture (which should most impact functionally similar species). This points toward the passenger model as the underlying cause of exotic dominance, although their combined effects (suppressive and facilitative) on community structure are substantial.},

However, the mechanisms underlying the positive plant diversity effects on soil carbon storage are poorly understood. We explored this relationship using long-term data from a grassland biodiversity experiment (The Jena Experiment) and radiocarbon (14C) modelling. Here we show that higher plant diversity increases rhizosphere carbon inputs into the microbial community resulting in both increased microbial activity and carbon storage. Increases in soil carbon were related to the enhanced accumulation of recently fixed carbon in high-diversity plots, while plant diversity had less pronounced effects on the decomposition rate of existing carbon. The present study shows that elevated carbon storage at high plant diversity is a direct function of the soil microbial community, indicating that the increase in carbon storage is mainly limited by the integration of new carbon into soil and less by the decomposition of existing soil carbon.},

	abstract = {The capacity of a landscape or ecosystem to provide multiple socio-economic and ecological benefits to society is referred to as multifunctionality. While this topic is receiving growing attention in politics and research, the concept continues to lack implementation partly due to varying conceptualizations and assessments of multifunctionality. To analyze how multifunctionality is conceptualized, characterized and quantified in scientific publications, we reviewed 101 studies that used quantitative methods to assess landscape or ecosystem multifunctionality. On average, 7.9 ± 4.7 ecosystem functions and services were considered, covering Provisioning (19\%), Regulating (30\%), Cultural (16\%) and Supporting (35\%) service categories. The studies ranged from micro-scale experiments to global analyses. Different methods were used to aggregate multifunctionality into a single metric (e.g. the number of ecosystem functions and services above a certain threshold, the average value of ecosystem functions and services, the sum of ecosystem functions and services). The interpretation of multifunctionality and the way it is operationalized varied largely among the studies: 42 studies assessed ecological and socio-economic variables in equal shares and often integrated stakeholders (33\%). 59 studies focused on ecological variables only and did not include stakeholders except for one study (1.7\%). Based on these findings, we discuss the implications of the conceptual and methodological ambiguity within multifunctionality assessments. We present the strengths and limitations of current approaches and provide recommendations for future multifunctionality assessments.},

We present a global meta-analysis of 199 articles reporting 1041 field studies that in total describe the impacts of 135 alien plant taxa on resident species, communities and ecosystems. Across studies, alien plants had a significant effect in 11 of 24 different types of impact assessed. The magnitude and direction of the impact varied both within and between different types of impact. On average, abundance and diversity of the resident species decreased in invaded sites, whereas primary production and several ecosystem processes were enhanced. While alien N-fixing species had greater impacts on N-cycling variables, they did not consistently affect other impact types. The magnitude of the impacts was not significantly different between island and mainland ecosystems. Overall, alien species impacts are heterogeneous and not unidirectional even within particular impact types. Our analysis also reveals that by the time changes in nutrient cycling are detected, major impacts on plant species and communities are likely to have already occurred.},

Introduced to North America and promoted at various times as a crop, an ornamental, and an erosion prevention tool, its negative impacts have been varied and severe in the United States. Dense populations overtop and smother crops and native vegetation, alter nitrogen cycles, and have the potential to affect air quality. Kudzu is winter-deciduous in North America with stems re-growing each season. In Canada, growth occurs from May until September, long enough for production of viable seed. Although widely believed to be intolerant of winter temperatures typical in eastern Canada, underground structures may be able to withstand temperatures as low as-30°C, and northward range expansion is predicted by climate change models. Dispersal in North America is primarily through intentional planting by humans, with clonal propagation and limited seed production and germination contributing to local population expansion. Only one population is known in Canada, near Leamington, Ontario. Once established, kudzu is difficult to eliminate or control without repeated actions. Efforts to prevent the movement and sale of kudzu in Canada, along with early detection and rapid response, monitoring, and education, offer potential strategies for control. Depending on the age, size and location of the population, herbicides, burning, mowing and grazing can be effective control measures.},

Hiking is becoming an important touristic attraction, but negative impacts may arise on trails. We aim to evaluate plant biodiversity along eight hiking trails located inside Special Areas of Conservation in two islands with different levels of population density and touristic activity (São Miguel and Flores). Along each trail, 3 plots of 5 × 5 m were used to evaluate the vegetation at every 500 m. Effects of distance to the trail border, altitude, trail, and island, were evaluated by: (i) diversity measures; (ii) floristic composition (different life forms; different biogeographic/conservation status); and (iii) identifying indicator species. Bayesian models run in WinBUGS and the R package “Indicspecies” were used. In total, 111 plant taxa were found, with: (i) highest species richness and diversity in the plots closer to the trail; (ii) highest evenness at the lowest altitude class; (iii) a reduction in the proportion of introduced species with increasing altitude; (iv) a variation in life forms’ composition between and within trails (with the altitude); and (v) the presence of indicator species associated to one altitude, one trail, or one island. The results showed a slight impact on vegetation from the presence of the trails, although with no major changes in the community composition. Presently, factors like the type of land use in areas surrounding the trails may have a deeper effect on plant biodiversity than trail use by visitors.},

	abstract = {We distributed a 16-question survey concerning noxious weed abundance, impacts, and management to livestock producers grazing on privately owned or leased grazing lands in Montana. The noxious weeds most commonly reported as being present on respondents’ grazing units were Canada thistle [Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop.] (64\% of grazing units) and leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula L.) (45\% of grazing units), and these species also reportedly caused the greatest reductions in livestock forage. Houndstongue (Cynoglossum officinale L.) was more prevalent than either spotted knapweed (Centaurea stoebe L.) or diffuse knapweed (Centaurea diffusa Lam.) (39\% vs. 32\% and 10\%, respectively, of grazing units), but collectively C. stoebe and C. diffusa were reported to cause greater forage reductions than C. officinale. The top three strategies used to manage noxious weeds were chemical control, grazing, and biological control. Combining survey responses with forage-loss models derived from field data for C. stoebe and E. esula, we estimated the combined cost of noxious weed management and forage losses on privately owned rangeland to be \$3.54 ha−1 yr−1, or \$7,243 annually for an average size grazing unit (i.e., 2,046 ha [5,055 ac]). Our estimates of economic losses are lower than many estimates from previous studies, possibly because we focused only on direct costs related to private grazing land, while other studies often consider indirect impacts. Nonetheless, our estimates are substantial; for example, our estimated loss equates to 24\% of the average per-hectare lease rate for Montana grazing land.},

	abstract = {Invasive alien plants (IAPs) have become a serious threat to biodiversity, agriculture and socio-economic development. Several aspects, including the ecological and economic impacts of IAPs have been explored in the recent past, however, perceptions of ecosystem services (ES) and ecosystem disservices (EDS) have not been well studied. IAPs affect the lives of local people both positively (providing ES) and negatively (providing EDS). IAPs in this region have not been studied through the aspects of ES and EDS that integrate the views and perceptions of local communities. Keeping in view this research gap, the present study was conducted in the Mirzapur district (Uttar Pradesh, India) where IAPs are widely distributed. In five sites covering a rural to urban gradient with increasing distance from forest, we randomly selected 100 respondents–20 from each of the five sites for the survey. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect respondents’ perceptions on ES and EDS supplied by IAPs in their local habitats. The questionnaire was designed to obtain data on awareness and knowledge, perceptions of ES and EDS, attitudes toward management, and socio-demographic information. Results indicated that 95\% of respondents were familiar with at least one of the 12 IAPs identified as being important in the region. Ipomea carnea and Stylosanthes hamata were the most and least frequently cited plants, respectively. Medical use and reduction in soil fertility were most perceived as ES and EDS, respectively. The value of Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (Spearman’s ρ = 0.487, p {\textgreater} 0.05) indicates a non-significant correlation between ranks of ES and EDS cited by respondents. Older and less educated people were more aware of the impacts of IAPs. Uprooting was the most commonly used management practice to control the invasion of plant species. People’s attitudes toward the management of IAPs seem to indicate that they prefer to eradicate species that have direct harmful effects on human health and biodiversity. This study provides inputs for incorporating people’s perceptions into the control and management of IAPs in the forest region.},

Invasive alien plants species (IAPS) are considered to be one of the major drivers of biodiversity loss and thereby altering the ecosystem services and socio-economic conditions through different mechanisms. Although the ecological impacts of IAPS are well documented, there is a dearth of studies regarding their economic quantification, livelihood considerations, biotechnological prospects (phytoremediation, bioenergy, phyto-synthesis of nanoparticles, biomedical, industrial applications etc.) and human health risk assessments of IAPS. In this context, the current panoramic review aimed to investigate the environmental, socio-ecological and health risks posed by IAPS as well as the compounded impact of IAPS with habitat fragmentation, climate and land use changes. To this end, the need of an integrated trans-disciplinary research is emphasized for the sustainable management of IAPS. The management prospects can be further strengthened through their linkage with geo-spatial technologies (remote sensing and GIS) by mapping and monitoring the IAPS spread. Further, the horizon of IAPS management is expanded to ecological indicator perspectives of IAPS, biosecurity, and risk assessment protocols with critical discussion. Moreover, positive as well as negative implications of the IAPS on environment, health, ecosystem services and socio-economy (livelihood) are listed so that a judicious policy framework could be developed for the IAPS management in order to mitigate the human health implications.},

The environmental economics approach to PES tries to force ecosystem services into the market model, with an emphasis on efficiency. The ecological economics approach, in contrast, seeks to adapt economic institutions to the physical characteristics of ecosystem services prioritizing ecological sustainability and just distribution and requiring a transdisciplinary approach. This paper summarizes the results of a participatory “atelier” workshop held in Costa Rica. We developed a set of principles (the Heredia Declaration) for PES systems and report on evolving initiatives in several countries. We discuss how the distinction between ecosystem goods (which are stock-flow resources) and ecosystem services (which are fund-service resources) and the physical characteristics of the fund-services affect the appropriate institutional form for PES. We conclude that PES systems represent an important way to effectively manage fund-service resources as public goods, and that this represents a significant departure from conventional market institutions.},

	abstract = {Global change, such as exotic invasions, dramatically affects ecosystem functioning. However, the mechanisms behind the impacts are often unclear and despite extensive experimental work, we know little about the importance of biodiversity loss as a component of global change effects in real-world ecosystems. We disentangled several mechanisms by which an exotic invader affected ecosystem functioning in East African drylands in Kenya and Ethiopia. We used structural equation modelling to separate direct effects of a woody invader Prosopis juliflora on a range of ecosystem functions from indirect effects mediated through changes in biodiversity (plant species richness) and ecosystem functioning (herbaceous biomass). We analysed effects on ecosystem functions linked to soil biogeochemical cycling and transfer of energy between trophic levels. We found that the mean size of individual indirect effects mediated by biodiversity and herbaceous biomass was about twice as large as the mean size of individual direct effects of Prosopis on ecosystem functions, showing that indirect effects are an important component of the invader’s overall environmental impacts. Changes in both herbaceous biomass and biodiversity were approximately equally important as drivers of indirect effects, indicating that we need to expand our view of indirect effects to consider a wider range of mechanisms. Simple univariate models failed to capture some Prosopis invader effects because positive direct effects on soil stability and predatory invertebrates were counteracted by negative indirect effects on biodiversity or biomass loss. The majority of effects were similar in both study systems. Suggestions that woody invaders are able to increase certain ecosystem functions may therefore have arisen because these negative indirect effects were not considered. Synthesis. Our study indicates that successful management of exotic invasions is likely to require not only control of the invader but also restoration of diverse and productive herbaceous communities as they are important for many ecosystem functions. This highlights the importance of biodiversity as a driver of ecosystem functioning also in real-world systems.},

	abstract = {I examine a number of problems that need to be identified and accounted for when examining the relationships between diversity and ecosystem function. Among these are measures of diversity and complexity in ecosystems: species richness, diversity indices, functional groups, keystone species, connectance, etc, all of which may be difficult to relate to ecosystem function. Several important distinctions, when testing diversity–function relationships empirically, are discussed: Diversity of functional groups, diversity within functional groups vs. total diversity; manipulating variables such as body-size distributions vs. manipulating diversity per se; effects of diversity vs. effects of biomass; and diversity–function relations under stable vs. changing conditions or perturbations. It is argued that for the management and development of sustainable ecosystems, it is probably more important to understand the linkages between key species or functional groups and ecosystem function, rather than focusing on species diversity. This is because there are possible mechanistic relations between what species do in ecosystems and ecosystem function. Diversity, being an abstract and aggregated property of the species in the context of communities and ecosystems, lacks such direct relations to ecosystem functions.},

	abstract = {Biotic invaders are species that establish a new range in which they proliferate, spread, and persist to the detriment of the environment. They are the most important ecological outcomes from the unprecedented alterations in the distribution of the earth's biota brought about largely through human transport and commerce. In a world without borders, few if any areas remain sheltered from these immigrations. The fate of immigrants is decidedly mixed. Few survive the hazards of chronic and stochastic forces, and only a small fraction become naturalized. In turn, some naturalized species do become invasive. There are several potential reasons why some immigrant species prosper: some escape from the constraints of their native predators or parasites; others are aided by human-caused disturbance that disrupts native communities. Ironically, many biotic invasions are apparently facilitated by cultivation and husbandry, unintentional actions that foster immigrant populations until they are self-perpetuating and uncontrollable. Whatever the cause, biotic invaders can in many cases inflict enormous environmental damage: (1) Animal invaders can cause extinctions of vulnerable native species through predation, grazing, competition, and habitat alteration. (2) Plant invaders can completely alter the fire regime, nutrient cycling, hydrology, and energy budgets in a native ecosystem and can greatly diminish the abundance or survival of native species. (3) In agriculture, the principal pests of temperate crops are nonindigenous, and the combined expenses of pest control and crop losses constitute an onerous “tax” on food, fiber, and forage production. (4) The global cost of virulent plant and animal diseases caused by parasites transported to new ranges and presented with susceptible new hosts is currently incalculable. Identifying future invaders and taking effective steps to prevent their dispersal and establishment constitutes an enormous challenge to both conservation and international commerce. Detection and management when exclusion fails have proved daunting for varied reasons: (1) Efforts to identify general attributes of future invaders have often been inconclusive. (2) Predicting susceptible locales for future invasions seems even more problematic, given the enormous differences in the rates of arrival among potential invaders. (3) Eradication of an established invader is rare, and control efforts vary enormously in their efficacy. Successful control, however, depends more on commitment and continuing diligence than on the efficacy of specific tools themselves. (4) Control of biotic invasions is most effective when it employs a long-term, ecosystem-wide strategy rather than a tactical approach focused on battling individual invaders. (5) Prevention of invasions is much less costly than post-entry control. Revamping national and international quarantine laws by adopting a “guilty until proven innocent” approach would be a productive first step. Failure to address the issue of biotic invasions could effectively result in severe global consequences, including wholesale loss of agricultural, forestry, and fishery resources in some regions, disruption of the ecological processes that supply natural services on which human enterprise depends, and the creation of homogeneous, impoverished ecosystems composed of cosmopolitan species. Given their current scale, biotic invasions have taken their place alongside human-driven atmospheric and oceanic alterations as major agents of global change. Left unchecked, they will influence these other forces in profound but still unpredictable ways.},

We report an alarming temporal trend in plant invasions in the Pacific Northwest over the past 100 years whereby counties highest in native species richness appear increasingly invaded over time. Despite the possibility of some increased awareness and reporting of native and exotic plant species in recent decades, historical records show a significant, consistent long-term increase in exotic species (number and frequency) at county, state and regional scales in the Pacific Northwest. Here, as in other regions of the country, colonization rates by exotic species are high and extirpation rates are negligible. The rates of species accumulation in space in multi-scale vegetation plots may provide some clues to the mechanisms of the invasion process from local to national scales.},

At subglobal scales, that is, within any defined area less extensive than the globe, species richness will increase when the number of nonnative species becoming naturalized is greater than the number of native species becoming extinct. Determining whether this has occurred is usually difficult because detailed records of species extinctions and naturalizations are rare; these records often exist, however, for oceanic islands. Here we show that species richness on oceanic islands has remained relatively unchanged for land birds, with the number of naturalizations being roughly equal to the number of extinctions, and has increased dramatically for vascular plants, with the number of naturalizations greatly exceeding the number of extinctions. In fact, for plants, the net number of species on islands has approximately doubled. We show further that these patterns are robust to differences in the history of human occupation of these islands and to the possibility of undocumented species extinctions. These results suggest that species richness may be increasing at subglobal scales for many groups and that future research should address what consequences this may have on ecological processes.},

	abstract = {• Premise of the study: Invasive plant species are typically thought to pose a large threat to native biodiversity, and local-scale studies typically confirm this view. However, plant invaders rarely cause regional extirpations or global extinctions, causing some to suggest that invasive species’ influence on native biodiversity may not be so dire. We aim to synthesize the seemingly conflicting literature in plant invasion biology by evaluating the effects of invasive plant species across spatial scales. • Methods: We first conducted a meta-analysis on the effects of invasive plants on the species richness of invaded communities across a range of spatial extents. We then discuss studies that consider the role of invasive plants on regional spatial scales for which such meta-analyses are not possible. Finally, we develop a conceptual framework to synthesize the influence of invasive species across spatial scales by explicitly recognizing how invasive species alter species-occupancy distributions. • Key results: We found a negative relationship between the spatial extent of the study and the effect size of invasive plants on species richness. Our simulation models suggest that this result can occur if invaders, either proportionately or disproportionately, reduce the occupancy of common species to a greater degree than rare species. • Conclusions: Future studies should consider the influence of invaders on the abundance and occupancy-level changes in native species to inform how invasive plants will influence native species richness relationships across spatial scales. This approach will allow greater predictive ability for forecasting changes in biodiversity in the face of anthropogenic biological invasions and will inform invasive species management and restoration.},

	abstract = {Alien invasive species can affect large areas, often with wide-ranging impacts on ecosystem structure, function, and services. Prunus serotina is a widespread invader of European temperate forests, where it tends to form homogeneous stands and limits recruitment of indigenous trees. We hypotesized that invasion by P. serotina would be reflected in the nutrient contents of the native species' leaves and in the respiration of invaded plots as efficient resource uptake and changes in nutrient cycling by P. serotina probably underly its aggressive invasiveness. We combined data from 48 field plots in the forest of Compiègne, France, and data from an experiment using 96 microcosms derived from those field plots. We used general linear models to separate effects of invasion by P. serotina on heterotrophic soil and litter respiration rates and on canopy foliar nutrient content from effects of soil chemical properties, litter quantity, litter species composition, and tree species composition. In invaded stands, average respiration rates were 5.6\% higher for soil (without litter) and 32\% higher for soil and litter combined. Compared to indigenous tree species, P. serotina exhibited higher foliar N (+24.0\%), foliar P (+50.7\%), and lower foliar C:N (−22.4\%) and N:P (−10.1\%) ratios. P. serotina affected foliar nutrient contents of co-occuring indigenous tree species leading to decreased foliar N (−8.7 \%) and increased C:N ratio (+9.5\%) in Fagus sylvatica, decreased foliar N:P ratio in Carpinus betulus (−13.5\%) and F. sylvatica (−11.8\%), and increased foliar P in Pinus sylvestris (+12.3\%) in invaded vs. uninvaded stands. Our results suggest that P. serotina is changing nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon cycles to its own advantage, hereby increasing carbon turnover via labile litter, affecting the relative nutrient contents in the overstory leaves, and potentially altering the photosynthetic capacity of the long-lived indigenous broadleaved species. Uncontrolled invasion of European temperate forests by P. serotina may affect the climate change mitigation potential of these forests in the long term, through additive effects on local nutrient cycles.},

Major advances include the identification of different invasion stages and invasiveness dimensions (geographic range, habitat specificity, local abundance) and the identification of appropriate comparators while accounting for propagule pressure and year of introduction. Developments in phylogenetic and functional trait research bear great promise for better understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Global patterns are emerging with propagule pressure, disturbance, increased resource availability, and climate matching as major invasion drivers, but species characteristics also play a role. Biotic interactions with resident communities shape invasion outcomes, with major roles for species diversity, enemies, novel weapons, and mutualists. Mounting evidence has been found for rapid evolution of invasive aliens and evolutionary responses of natives, but a mechanistic understanding requires tighter integration of molecular and phenotypic approaches. We hope the open questions identified in this review will stimulate further research on the ecology and evolution of alien plants.},

Release from these specialist enemies is also thought by some to lead to the evolution of increased competitive ability, driven by a decrease in the plant's resource allocation to consumer defense and an increase in allocation to size or fecundity. Here, we discuss a new theory for invasive success – the “novel weapons hypothesis”. We propose that some invaders transform because they possess novel biochemical weapons that function as unusually powerful allelopathic agents, or as mediators of new plant–soil microbial interactions. Root exudates that are relatively ineffective against their natural neighbors because of adaptation, may be highly inhibitory to newly encountered plants in invaded communities. In other words, the novel weapons of some plant invaders provide them with an advantage that may arise from differences in the regional coevolutionary trajectories of plant communities. Furthermore, the selective advantage of possessing a novel weapon may result in rapid evolution of that weapon – for example, the production of greater quantities of allelopathic or antimicrobial root exudates. Direct selection of competitive traits provides an alternative to the “grow versus defend” trade-offs that underpin the theory of the evolution of increased competitive ability.},

	abstract = {One of the most cited hypotheses explaining the inordinate success of a small proportion of introduced plants that become pests is the ‘natural enemies hypothesis’. This states that invasive introduced plants spread rapidly because they are liberated from their co-evolved natural enemies. This hypothesis had not been properly tested until recently. Previous reviews on this topic have been narrative and vote counting in nature. In this review, we carried out quantitative synthesis and meta-analysis using existing literature on plants and their herbivores to test the different components of the enemy release hypothesis. We found supporting evidence in that (1) insect herbivore fauna richness is significantly greater in the native than introduced ranges, and the reduction is skewed disproportionally towards specialists and insects feeding on reproductive parts; and (2) herbivore damage levels are greater on native plants than on introduced invasive congeners. However, herbivore damage levels are only marginally greater for plants in native than in introduced ranges, probably due to the small numbers of this type of study. Studies quantifying herbivore impacts on plant population dynamics are too scarce to make conclusions for either comparison of plants in native vs introduced ranges or of co-occurring native and introduced congeners. For future research, we advocate that more than two-way comparisons between plants in native and introduced ranges, or native and introduced congeners are needed. In addition, the use of herbivore exclusions to quantify the impacts of herbivory on complete sets of population vital rates of native vs introduced species are highly desirable. Furthermore, three-way comparisons among congeners of native plants, introduced invasive, and introduced non-invasive plants can also shed light on the importance of enemy release. Finally, simultaneously testing the enemy release hypothesis and other competing hypotheses will provide significant insights into the mechanisms governing the undesirable success of invasive species.},

Many studies have tested the predictions of the ERH using the community approach (native and non-native species studied in the same habitat) or the biogeographical approach (species studied in their native and non-native range), but results are highly variable, possibly due to large variety of study systems incorporated. We therefore focused on one specific system: plants and their herbivorous insects. We performed a systematic review and compiled a large number (68) of datasets from studies comparing herbivorous insects on native and non-native plants using the community or biogeographical approach. We performed a meta-analysis to test the predictions from the ERH for insect diversity (number of species), insect load (number of individuals) and level of herbivory for both the community and biogeographical approach. For both the community and biogeographical approach insect diversity was significantly higher on native than on non-native plants. Insect load tended to be higher on native than non-native plants at the community approach only. Herbivory was not different between native and non-native plants at the community approach, while there was too little data available for testing the biogeographical approach. Our metaanalysis generally supports the predictions from the ERH for both the community and biogeographical approach, but also shows that the outcome is importantly determined by the response measured and approach applied. So far, very few studies apply both approaches simultaneously in a reciprocal manner while this is arguably the best way for testing the ERH.},

Despite the demonstrated importance of enemies to host population dynamics, studies of the ERH are split – biogeographical analyses primarily show a reduction in the diversity of enemies in the introduced range compared with the native range, while community studies imply that NIS are no less affected by enemies than native species in the invaded community. A broad review of the invasion literature implies at least eight non-exclusive explanations for this enigma. In addition, we argue that the ERH has often been accepted uncritically wherever (i) NIS often appear larger, more fecund, or somehow ‘better’ than either congeners in the introduced region, or conspecifics in the native range; and (ii) known enemies are conspicuously absent from the introduced range. However, all NIS, regardless of their abundance or impact, will lose natural enemies at a biogeographical scale. Given the complexity of processes that underlie biological invasions, we argue against a simple relationship between enemy ‘release’ and the vigour, abundance or impact of NIS.},

	abstract = {Much as Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring was a call to action against the pesticides that were devastating bird populations, Charles S. Elton’s classic The Ecology of Invasions by Animals and Plants sounded an early warning about an environmental catastrophe that has become all too familiar today—the invasion of nonnative species. From kudzu to zebra mussels to Asian long-horned beetles, nonnative species are colonizing new habitats around the world at an alarming rate thanks to accidental and intentional human intervention. One of the leading causes of extinctions of native animals and plants, invasive species also wreak severe economic havoc, causing \$79 billion worth of damage in the United States alone.Elton explains the devastating effects that invasive species can have on local ecosystems in clear, concise language and with numerous examples. The first book on invasion biology, and still the most cited, Elton’s masterpiece provides an accessible, engaging introduction to one of the most important environmental crises of our time.Charles S. Elton was one of the founders of ecology, who also established and led Oxford University’s Bureau of Animal Population. His work has influenced generations of ecologists and zoologists, and his publications remain central to the literature in modern biology."History has caught up with Charles Elton’s foresight, and The Ecology of Invasions can now be seen as one of the central scientific books of our century."—David Quammen, from the Foreword to Killer Algae: The True Tale of a Biological Invasion},

	abstract = {Research Highlights: Urban ecosystems are claimed to be more invaded than natural vegetation. Despite numerous studies, the patterns of alien species occurrence in urban forests are rarely linked to invasion ecology hypotheses. Background and Objectives: We assumed that patterns of invasion level (i.e., neophyte richness) and neophyte ecological success (cover) are context-dependent, i.e., depend on the type of vegetation, and that hypotheses connected with empty niche and biotic acceptance will have the strongest support in urban forests. We also tested biotic resistance, habitat filtering, disturbance, resource availability, and environmental heterogeneity hypotheses. Materials and Methods: Using a random forest algorithm, we tested the importance of factors related to invasion ecology hypotheses in a dataset of urban forest vegetation plots (n = 120). We studied seven types of forest plant communities occurring in Poznań (W Poland) and we assessed the vegetation’s taxonomic and functional composition. Results: We found that models of alien species richness and cover explained 28.5\% and 35.0\% of variance, respectively. Vegetation type was of the highest importance in both cases, suggesting that the occurrence of alien plant species is context-dependent. Resource availability and disturbance ecological indicator values were also of high importance. Conclusions: Our study supported resource availability and habitat filtering hypotheses as explanations of the level of invasion and ecological success of alien species in an urban forest, with partial support for the disturbance hypothesis. Our study revealed that predictors of invasion level are context-dependent, as patterns of alien species richness and cover differed among vegetation types. We highlight context-dependence of alien species invasion patterns in different vegetation types due to the habitat-forming role of dominant tree species and different availability of resources and disturbance levels, as well as different pools of native species. Thus, prevention and management of biological invasions in urban forests should account for forest vegetation type.},

We review different strategies, including specific experimental and observational approaches, for detecting and quantifying the ecological impacts of alien species. These include a four-way experimental plot design for comparing impact studies of different organisms. Furthermore, we identify hypothesis-driven parameters that should be measured at invaded sites to maximize insights into the nature of the impact. We also present strategies for recognizing high-impact species.

Few studies have incorporated social dimensions of invasive alien species (IAS) management. In this study, we surveyed visitors (N=1166) to Cumberland Island National Seashore, GA, USA, to measure their knowledge of, attitudes toward, and preferences for various IAS management options. Multinomial logistic regression, two-step cluster analysis, and the Potential for Conflict Index were used to determine factors that predict support for IAS control, identify subgroups of visitors with unique management preferences, and evaluate the level of consensus among these distinct groups. Results showed that, although knowledge and perceived threat scores were related to management preferences, environmental attitude orientations were the best indicators of support for IAS control. Absolute ecocentric visitors (typically younger, less educated individuals with less experience in parks) believed that all living things have a right to coexist without disruption and favored a hands-off management approach. Adaptive ecocentric visitors (typically older, more educated individuals with more experience in parks) believed that some degree of human interference is necessary to maintain ecosystem integrity and favored hands-on management. Despite these different perspectives, adaptive on-site control of invasive species was viewed as the most acceptable and least controversial management option across all visitor subgroups. This study may inform IAS management practices by providing a framework for identifying stakeholder characteristics and synthesizing public preferences to minimize conflict and highlight ecologically beneficial and socially acceptable outcomes.},

L'outil de base en la matière est une liste des plantes nuisibles. Dans cet article, nous proposons une liste pour le Québec constituée grâce à une approche qualitative innovante basée sur 1) l'adoption de critères d'évaluation explicites, 2) la prise en compte de l'ensemble des types de nuisance, 3) l'utilisation de données scientifiques crédibles, 4) la constitution d'un panel d'experts diversifié comprenant des utilisateurs potentiels de la liste, 5) l'encadrement des membres du panel par une approche d'aide à la décision et 6) l'instauration du débat pour l'évaluation du caractère nuisible des plantes. Au total, 87 des 908 taxons de plantes vasculaires exotiques naturalisées au Québec ont été retenus par le panel d'experts comme plantes nuisibles, soit 9,6 \% de l'ensemble. Les deux tiers des plantes désignées comme nuisibles le sont, à des degrés divers, pour les productions agricoles, horticoles ou forestières. Suivent, dans l'ordre, les nuisances pour la biodiversité ou le maintien des fonctions écosystémiques, celles pour la santé, celles pour l'horticulture ornementale ou l'aménagement paysager et celles pour les activités de loisir. Il a été difficile de statuer sur la nuisance pour la biodiversité, la plupart des espèces exotiques n'ayant pas fait l'objet d'études approfondies à cet égard. En définitive, l'adoption de critères faisant consensus a eu pour effet de réduire fortement (presque par un facteur de 3) le nombre de taxons d'une liste qu'on aurait pu constituer à partir d'opinions d'experts sollicitées sur une base individuelle, sans critères précis. Bien que cette liste ne soit pas définitive et qu'elle doive être interprétée avec prudence, nous croyons que l'approche proposée ici est supérieure, quant à sa rigueur, aux autres approches qualitatives développées à ce jour et que sa performance est au moins équivalente à celle des approches semi-quantitatives ou quantitatives fréquemment utilisées, comme le Australian Weed Risk Assessment.},

These collapses in top predator populations are commonly associated with dramatic increases in the abundance of smaller predators. Known as "mesopredator release," this trophic interaction has been recorded across a range of communities and ecosystems. Mesopredator outbreaks often lead to declining prey populations, sometimes destabilizing communities and driving local extinctions. We present an overview of mesopredator release and illustrate how its underlying concepts can be used to improve predator management in an increasingly fragmented world. We also examine shifts in North American carnivore ranges during the past 200 years and show that 60\% of mesopredator ranges have expanded, whereas all apex predator ranges have contracted. The need to understand how best to predict and manage mesopredator release is urgentmesopredator outbreaks are causing high ecological, economic, and social costs around the world.},

	abstract = {The problem of feral and stray cat predation is an old one and the effects are evident, however, the consequences are highly underestimated. Studies that analyze these effects are limited and offer no clear description. It is essential to provide a detailed review regarding cat predation and outline the dangers and possible solutions. Felines are highly adaptable and very effective predators. Feral cats have played part in driving countless bird and mammal species to extinction. Cat predation is especially worrying on small islands as potential prey may lack evolved defensive mechanisms to avoid predators. As soon as an invasive species is first introduced to the new area they begin an exponential reproduction and thus, disperse quickly in a new ecosystem. Upon the first successful introduction, invasive species either occupy an available niche or outcompete a previous inhabitant of the niche. Domestic cats proved to be successful in this regard as they managed to reproduce, disperse and outcompete other species in no time. On top of that, feral and stray cats carry diseases that may further decline wildlife populations. T. gondii antibodies were found in species such as mouflon, red deer, fallow deer, roe deer and wild boar. This is worrying as game meat consumption around the world has increased over the last decades and thus Toxoplasmosis has become a real threat for humans as well. Other diseases carried and transmitted by feral and stray cats include rabies, feline leukemia and cat scratch. Due to the fact that cats have been closely associated with humans for centuries, discussing the methods of cat control is controversial. There are two main methods talked about among the public – Trap Neuter Release (TNR) and catch – remove. TNR is favored by many animal welfare organizations since it is believed to gradually decrease cat population while at the same time relieve cats of mating and parenting stress. Conservationists, on the other hand, argue in favor of eradication methods as it is believed to be the only fast and effective solution. However, despite the disagreement, both sides agree that it is crucial that cats are kept indoors and are equipped with bell collars. This thesis provides a summary of the problem, the management and the solutions developed to reduce feral and stray cats in order to mitigate the problems they have caused.},

	abstract = {Accidental introductions of nonindigenous invasive species impair ecosystems, increase the risk of native species extinctions, and cause substantial economic damages on a worldwide basis. Despite the magnitude of the problem, very little economic analysis has been focused on this topic to date. This manuscript develops an optimal control model of the management of a nonindigenous species stock following its introduction and establishment. We find that the influence of changes in ecological and human factors (such as the invader's intrinsic growth rate, carrying capacity, and the effectiveness of invasive species management technologies) on the optimal level of management are analytically (mathematically) ambiguous in sign and depend on the values of other parameters and variables. To estimate actual numerical solutions to the model and conduct sensitivity analyses, we construct a case study illustration based on invasive plant species on arid lands. The illustration shows that the optimal level of management effort is sensitive to biological and ecological factors (the stock's intrinsic rate of growth, the carrying capacity afforded the invasive species, and the form of the invader's growth function) that are species- and site-specific as well as uncertain given currently available scientific information. This highlights the need for better collaboration and information transfer between economists and scientists interested in this topic. Given that resources for addressing nonindigenous species threats typically are quite constrained, and complete eradication in a particular area is often technically infeasible, the model provides useful insight on optimal levels of ongoing management and how they may vary according to bioeconomic factors.},

Understanding and reducing their impacts is a global conservation priority. We review knowledge about the impacts and management of feral cats in Australia, and identify priorities for research and management. In Australia, the most well understood and significant impact of feral cats is predation on threatened mammals. Other impacts include predation on other vertebrates, resource competition, and disease transmission, but knowledge of these impacts remains limited. Lethal control is the most common form of management, particularly via specifically designed poison baits. Non-lethal techniques include the management of fire, grazing, food, and trophic cascades. Managing interactions between these processes is key to success. Given limitations on the efficacy of feral cat management, conservation of threatened mammals has required the establishment of insurance populations on predator-free islands and in fenced mainland enclosures. Research and management priorities are to: prevent feral cats from driving threatened species to extinction; assess the efficacy of new management tools; trial options for control via ecosystem management; and increase the potential for native fauna to coexist with feral cats.},

They represent different forms of control, namely the initial release of infected predators on the one hand and culling as well as trapping, infecting, and returning predators on the other hand. Combinations of different control methods have been proposed to complement their respective strengths in reducing predator numbers and thus protecting endangered prey. Here, we formulate and analyze an eco-epidemiological model, provide analytical results on the optimal control problem, and use a forward-backward sweep method for numerical simulations.

	abstract = {We have been collaborating since 1992 in studies on southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis) as part of a program to define factors, which may be responsible for limiting the growth of the southern sea otter population. We previously demonstrated Toxoplasma gondii in sea otters. We postulated that cat feces containing oocysts could be entering the marine environment through storm run-off or through municipal sewage since cat feces are often disposed down toilets by cat owners. The present study examined the sporulation of T. gondii oocysts in seawater and the survival of sporulated oocysts in seawater. Unsporulated oocysts were placed in 15 ppt artificial seawater, 32 ppt artificial seawater or 2\% sulfuric acid (positive control) at 24 C in an incubator. Samples were examined daily for 3 days and development monitored by counting 100 oocysts from each sample. From 75 to 80\% of the oocysts were sporulated by 3 days post-inoculation under all treatment conditions. Groups of 2 mice were fed 10,000 oocysts each from each of the 3 treatment groups. All inoculated mice developed toxoplasmosis indicating that oocysts were capable of sporulating in seawater. Survival of sporulated oocysts was examined by placing sporulated T. gondii oocysts in 15 ppt seawater at room temperature 22-24 C (RT) or in a refrigerator kept at 4 C. Mice fed oocysts that had been stored at 4C or RT for 6 months became infected. These results indicate that T. gondii oocysts can sporulate and remain viable in seawater for several months.},

	abstract = {Macroecological approaches can provide valuable insight into the epidemiology of globally distributed, multi-host pathogens. Toxoplasma gondii is a zoonotic protozoan that infects any warm-blooded animal, including humans, in almost every ecosystem worldwide. There is substantial geographical variation in T. gondii prevalence in wildlife populations and the mechanisms driving this variation are poorly understood. We implemented Bayesian phylogenetic mixed models to determine the association between species’ ecology, phylogeny and climatic and anthropogenic factors on T. gondii prevalence. Toxoplasma gondii prevalence data were compiled for free-ranging wild mammal species from 202 published studies, encompassing 45 079 individuals from 54 taxonomic families and 238 species. We found that T. gondii prevalence was positively associated with human population density and warmer temperatures at the sampling location. Terrestrial species had a lower overall prevalence, but there were no consistent patterns between trophic level and prevalence. The relationship between human density and T. gondii prevalence is probably mediated by higher domestic cat abundance and landscape degradation leading to increased environmental oocyst contamination. Landscape restoration and limiting free-roaming in domestic cats could synergistically increase the resiliency of wildlife populations and reduce wildlife and human infection risks from one of the world's most common parasitic infections.},

Yet, there is a paucity of information on the impact of cat predation in urban areas, where most cats are likely to be present. 2 We quantified the minimum number of animals killed annually by cats in a 4.2-km2 area of Bristol, UK, by asking owners to record prey animals returned home by their pets. The potential impact of cat predation on prey species was estimated by comparing the number of animals killed with published estimates of prey density and annual productivity. 3 Predator density was 229 cats/km2. 4 Five mammal, 10 bird and one amphibian prey species were recorded. Mean predation rate was 21 prey/cat/annum. The most commonly recorded prey species was the wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus. 5 Predation on birds was greatest in spring and summer, and probably reflected the killing of juvenile individuals. For three prey species (house sparrow Passer domesticus, dunnock Prunella modularis, robin Erithacus rubecula), estimated predation rates were high relative to annual productivity, such that predation by cats may have created a dispersal sink for juveniles from more productive neighbouring areas. The impact of cats on these species therefore warrants further investigation.},

	abstract = {The overpopulation of domestic cats (Felis catus) presents a serious concern for wildlife conservationists, animal welfare advocates, public health officials, and community members alike. In cities, free-ranging, unowned cats often form high-density groups (commonly called ‘colonies’) around human provisioned food sources. While previous diet studies have primarily utilized morphology-based methods, molecular techniques offer a higher resolution alternative. In this study, we used next-generation sequencing techniques to examine the diet composition of feral cats living in five Trap-Neuter-Return colonies located in urban parks on Staten Island, a borough of New York City. We hypothesized that (1) cats living in urban colonies would still consume natural prey despite being regularly fed and (2) that the composition of taxa represented in the diet of each colony would vary, possibly due to differences in prey availability across sites. In total, 16 vertebrate prey taxa were identified in the diet, 13 at the genus level and 3 at the family level. Despite being regularly fed, 58.2\% of cat scats contained DNA from natural prey. The diet composition of the cat colonies differed depending on the land cover composition surrounding the colony with the frequency of native prey positively correlated with the proportion of green space and that of non-native prey with developed land cover types. The use of molecular techniques combined with environmental DNA methods offers a promising, non-invasive approach to assessing the diet and consequently, impact of a highly abundant and non-native predator on the persistence of wildlife communities in cities.},

	abstract = {While there is intense debate regarding the impact of domestic cat populations on wildlife, its resolution is hindered by the lack of quite basic information. Domestic cats are generalist and obligate predators that receive supplementary food, and their population density reflects that of humans more than the density of their prey. In such a predator–prey system there is the potential for cat populations to have negative impacts on avian assemblages, which may be indicated by negative correlations between cat density and avian species richness and density. Here we report on the nature of such correlations across urban areas in Britain both for groups of species classified regarding their vulnerability to cat predation and individual species. Taking the availability of green space into account, we find negative relationships between cat densities and the number of bird species breeding in urban 1 km × 1 km squares. These relationships are particularly strong among groups of species that are vulnerable to cat predation. We find positive correlations between cat and avian densities; these have low explanatory power and shallow slopes among the species groups that are particularly vulnerable to cat predation. Evidence that the densities of individual species that are vulnerable to cat predation are negatively correlated with cat densities is equivocal, with at least half the species showing no marked pattern, and the remainder exhibiting contrasting patterns. Our results appear not to be confounded by the density of nest-predating corvids (carrion crow, magpie, and jay), as the density of these species was not strongly negatively correlated with avian species richness or density. The general lack of marked negative correlations between cat and avian densities at our focal spatial scale may be a consequence of consistently high cat densities in our study areas (minimum density is 132 cats per square kilometre), and thus uniformly high impacts of cat populations on urban avian assemblages.},

Understanding and reducing their impacts is a global conservation priority. We review knowledge about the impacts and management of feral cats in Australia, and identify priorities for research and management. In Australia, the most well understood and significant impact of feral cats is predation on threatened mammals. Other impacts include predation on other vertebrates, resource competition, and disease transmission, but knowledge of these impacts remains limited. Lethal control is the most common form of management, particularly via specifically designed poison baits. Non-lethal techniques include the management of fire, grazing, food, and trophic cascades. Managing interactions between these processes is key to success. Given limitations on the efficacy of feral cat management, conservation of threatened mammals has required the establishment of insurance populations on predator-free islands and in fenced mainland enclosures. Research and management priorities are to: prevent feral cats from driving threatened species to extinction; assess the efficacy of new management tools; trial options for control via ecosystem management; and increase the potential for native fauna to coexist with feral cats.},

Predation is the strongest deleterious effect of cats on wildlife, inducing a direct negative impact on population size and dynamics, breeding success and changes in species assemblages. Direct predation is not the only damaging impact on native wildlife, since cats can be responsible for other poorly-documented underlying ecological impacts, like competition, hybridization, disease transmission, ecological process alteration, and behavioral change. Here, we pinpoint relevant examples of these ecological impacts, by searching for accurate data from published literature. We used electronic databases covering most of the world islands where the effects of cats were documented. Knowledge of these impacts can be of great importance to preserve insular ecosystem functions and persistence of endangered native species. We emphasize that direct predation processes should not be the only factor considered in the management of invasive cats on islands.},

	abstract = {As part of a comparative study of agricultural impacts on wildlife, modifications to the point count method were evaluated for surveying birds in, and adjacent to, cropland during the breeding season (May to early July) in Ontario. Location in the field, observation direction and distance, number of visits, and number of study sites per farm were examined using point counts of 5-minute duration in 1989 and 10-minute duration in 1990. Bird species number and abundance were not significantly different between point counts conducted from field-edge and field-interior (100 m or less from the edge) locations at the same study site (median field size = 6 ha). At each field-edge location, semicircular counts detected significantly fewer, but still about 85 percent of species and 80 percent of individuals detected in circular counts. We attributed the poor performance of circular counts to poor visibility through wooded field-edges, poor habitat quality, and an edge-effect on bird activity. Limited-distance (within 100 m of observer) point counts detected significantly fewer, and only 59 percent and 69 percent of species and individuals detected with unlimited-distance (but still on farm) point counts per study site in 1989 and 1990. Species number of each study site was still increasing significantly for all point count methods after three visits in 1989 and four visits in 1990. Bird abundance at each site was not significantly different among visits in 1989 or among the last three of four visits in 1990. We argue these results reflect spatial dynamics in the distribution of birds and species in cropland throughout the breeding season. Our study farms appeared to be well-sampled by field-edge, semicircular, unlimited-distance point counts at a sampling intensity of one study site per 26 ha based on comparisons with point counts from a larger number of study sites, search (walk-about) surveys of study sites, and noncrop areas on farms. Relevance of our results to recommended point count standards is discussed.},

	url = {https://archipel.uqam.ca/3342/},
	abstract = {La forêt boréale mixte de l'est du Canada constitue une zone de transition entre la forêt boréale résineuse et la forêt décidue tempérée. Cette zone est composée d'une riche population d'oiseaux cavicoles, incluant sept espèces de pics. Les perturbations humaines (agriculture et industrie forestière) ont beaucoup modifié cet écosystème en 
réduisant considérablement la quantité et la superficie de forêts matures ainsi que la quantité d'arbres de grand calibre, vivants ou morts, requis pour l'excavation de cavités par les pics. Deux aspects de cette problématique ont été traités dans ce mémoire. Le premier chapitre vise à caractériser les besoins des oiseaux utilisateurs de cavités en déterminant quelles essences d'arbres contribuent à la présence de chicots de grand calibre (dhp ≥ 20 cm) et à étudier les caractéristiques de la végétation qui affectent la sélection de l'habitat par les pics à l'échelle locale (rayon de 250 m) et à l'échelle du paysage (rayon de 1 km). Les rôles écologiques (soit espèces clé et/ou parapluie) de ces oiseaux ont également été étudiés. Le deuxième chapitre porte davantage sur les besoins alimentaires du Grand Pic. Les facteurs importants qui distinguent les arbres sélectionnés lors de sa quête alimentaire ainsi que les distributions temporelle et spatiale des marques d'alimentation ont été étudiées. L'aire d'étude se situe en Abitibi, au nord-ouest du Québec, dans la sapinière à bouleaux blancs. Afin de détecter la présence de pics et de hiboux cavicoles, un dispositif de 230 points d'appels a été élaboré le long des routes dans différents milieux forestiers. Dans le but de quantifier les arbres morts et vivants disponibles à l'échelle locale, des transects de végétation ont été effectués (1000 m²). Ces derniers ont aussi permis de caractériser les arbres utilisés pour l'excavation de cavités par les pics ainsi que par le Grand Pic (Dryocopus pileatus) lors de son alimentation. Des analyses géomatiques ont été menées pour déterminer les caractéristiques du paysage associées à la présence des pics. Nos résultats indiquent que le Pic flamboyant (Colaptes auratus) et le Pic maculé (Sphyrapicus varius) sont les deux espèces les plus abondantes dans notre aire d'étude tandis que le Grand Pic, le Pic à dos noir (Picoides arcticus) et le Pic à dos rayé (P. dorsalis) se font les plus rares. La probabilité d'occurrence pour la majorité des pics est davantage reliée aux attributs de l'échelle locale qu'à ceux de l'échelle du paysage. Le peuplier faux-tremble (Populus tremuloides) est l'essence la plus souvent excavée lors de la création de cavités par les pics et elle est aussi l'essence la plus représentée dans la catégorie des arbres de grand calibre. De plus, la majorité des cavités ont été excavées dans des arbres de grand calibre, et ce pour toutes les espèces de pics y compris celles qui creusent de petites cavités. Pour ces raisons, le peuplier faux-tremble est une espèce d'arbre d'intérêt faunique clé en forêt boréale mixte aménagée d'Abitibi. La présence de la Petite Nyctale (Aegolius acadicus) est associée de façon significative à la présence du Grand Pic mais pas à celle du Pic flamboyant. Cette association suggère que le Grand Pic serait une espèce clé de voûte (keystone) par la création de grande cavités en forêt boréale mixte. Selon l'indice proposé par Fleishman,la Petite Nyctale représente parmi les espèces cavicoles suivies dans cette étude celle qui est la plus propice à être désignée espèce parapluie. Le Grand Pic tend à s'alimenter sur les plus gros arbres disponibles. Il s'alimente majoritairement sur le sapin baumier (Abies balsamea) et sur le peuplier faux-tremble. Presque toutes les excavations d'alimentation observées se retrouvent sur la partie inférieure des arbres. Aucune essence ou diamètre
d'arbre ne semble être toutefois favorisé lors de la réalimentation année après année. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ MOTS-CLÉS DE L’AUTEUR : Excavateurs primaires de cavités, Utilisateurs secondaires de cavité, Peuplier faux-tremble, Grand Pic, Arbres morts.},

	title = {Qualité des parcelles d'habitat résiduel des paysages aménagés en forêt boréale mixte pour la reproduction et l'alimentation du pic maculé ({Sphyrapicus} varius)},
	url = {https://archipel.uqam.ca/5517/},
	abstract = {Dans plusieurs écosystèmes, les pics sont considérés comme des espèces clés. Cette désignation provient principalement de leur capacité à excaver des cavités qui seront ensuite disponibles pour plusieurs animaux cavicoles incapables de creuser leur propre cavité. De plus, leur sensibilité à la perte d'attributs forestiers, comme le bois mort et les arbres de gros diamètre, en font de bons bio-indicateurs de la qualité de l'habitat et de la biodiversité. Dans notre aire d'étude, le Pic maculé (Sphyrapicus varius) représente l'excavateur fournissant le plus grand nombre de cavités et les utilisateurs secondaires de petite taille sont grandement liés à la disponibilité des cavités créées par cette espèce. La sensibilité du Pic maculé à la perte de substrats de nidification, la perte de forêt mature et la fragmentation ont déjà été relevées dans la littérature scientifique. La présente étude a donc pour but d'évaluer la qualité des parcelles résiduelles linéaires de forêt mature qui ont été épargnées par la coupe forestière, pour les besoins écologiques du Pic maculé. Cette étude s'inscrit dans une évaluation de l'importance du maintien de ces parcelles résiduelles de forêts âgées ({\textgreater} 80 ans) alors que la réglementation québécoise ne garantit pas leur protection à long terme. Le premier chapitre compare la disponibilité et l'utilisation des substrats de nidification et d'alimentation du Pic maculé entre les parcelles de forêts âgées d'un paysage aménagé par la coupe et la forêt âgée d'un paysage sous régime de perturbations naturelles. Les données proviennent essentiellement d'un inventaire des arbres de 10 cm et plus de diamètre à hauteur de poitrine (dhp) dans des quadrats de 0,04 hectare (ha). Ces quadrats ont été disposés de façon systématique dans les sites des deux paysages, mais également autour d'arbres de nidification actifs. Les analyses montrent que la densité de substrats de nidification est similaire entre les deux types de paysages. Par contre, les parcelles résiduelles du paysage aménagé sont les hôtes d'une plus forte infection par un champignon (Phellinus tremulae) qui facilite l'excavation des substrats par le Pic maculé. De plus, les peupliers faux-tremble (Populus tremuloides) de gros diamètres sont davantage présents dans les quadrats situés autour des substrats de nidification que dans les quadrats systématiques situés dans les sites d'étude et ce, pour les deux types de paysages. Enfin, le Pic maculé utilise davantage le sapin baumier (Abies balsamea), l'aulne rugueux (Alnus rugosa) et les saules (Salix sp.) comme substrats d'alimentation dans le paysage aménagé. Le deuxième chapitre évalue dans les mêmes paysages la qualité de l'habitat au moyen de mesures directes portant sur les paramètres de l'activité reproductrice et de l'activité d'alimentation du Pic maculé pendant la saison de reproduction. Ces données ont été recueillies en effectuant, pendant quatre étés, le suivi de nids actifs à l'aide d'une caméra fixée à une pôle télescopique. Nous avons également effectué des suivis du comportement d'alimentation des oisillons par les adultes à l'aide d'un télescope et d'une caméra. Ces suivis nous ont permis de comparer la fréquence à laquelle les adultes nourrissent les jeunes et la grosseur des bols alimentaires qu'ils rapportent au nid. Nous avons également fait le suivi des trajectoires utilisées par les adultes lorsqu'ils recherchent la nourriture dans le milieu. Les résultats montrent que 1) le succès reproducteur, 2) la fréquence d'alimentation des jeunes, 3) la grosseur des bols alimentaires rapportés aux jeunes ainsi que 4) les patrons de déplacement des adultes pour rechercher la nourriture, sont tous similaires entre les deux types de paysages. Dans l'ensemble, les forêts résiduelles dans le territoire aménagé représentent un habitat de bonne qualité pour répondre aux besoins écologiques du Pic maculé, notamment par leur disponibilité en substrats d'alimentation et de nidification. De plus, cette étude suggère que l'activité reproductrice du Pic maculé dans les forêts résiduelles du paysage aménagé peut contribuer au maintien de populations locales dans cet environnement. Elle indique également par la productivité élevée qui y est observée, que les forêts résiduelles des paysages aménagés ne sont pas des habitats "fuites" (Pulliam, 1988) pour le Pic maculé, mais qu'au contraire ils peuvent contribuer de manière positive au maintien de populations locales de cette espèce dans notre secteur d'étude. Enfin, cette étude montre que le rôle fonctionnel du Pic maculé quant à sa capacité à creuser des cavités utilisables par d'autres espèces est maintenu dans les forêts âgées résiduelles de paysages aménagés.

	abstract = {Forest dynamics following a partial cut conducted in the early 1950s in the Lac Édouard Experimental Forest in the Mauricie National Park, Quebec, Canada, were studied. Changes in vegetation were analyzed for the period between 1946 and 2001 in 109 mesic stands of the sugar maple – yellow birch bioclimatic domain. Three cutting intensities were considered: 1) low intensity, 15–30\% of the basal area; 2) moderate intensity, 30–45\% of the basal area; and 3) uncut. More than fifty years following cutting, the original relative proportion of the deciduous and softwood species was maintained. The relative proportion of basal area occupied by softwood species relative to the total basal area varied only from 2.0\% to 7.4\%. Red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) basal area increased in forest types Cornus (Co) and Oxalis-Cornus (O-Co) whereas balsam fir basal area decreased. In the Viburnum-Oxalis (Vi-O) forest type, sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) basal area increased and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britt.) decreased. Cutting areas were not invaded by competition species such as mountain maple (Acer spicatum Lamb.). In the Co and O-Co forest types, the regeneration density is probably sufficient to maintain the current cover type. In the Vi-O forest type, where moderate partial cutting was conducted, the deciduous component could substantially increase. Stands reacted positively to partial cutting. The increased growth of residual stems and the arrival of new stems resulted in 2001 total basal areas that were equal to or larger than those observed before cutting (1946).

The functions in the vegan package contain tools for diversity analysis, ordination methods and tools for the analysis of dissimilarities. Together with the labdsv package, the vegan package provides most standard tools of descriptive community analysis. Package ade4 provides an alternative comprehensive package, and several other packages complement vegan and provide tools for deeper analysis in specific fields. Package https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BiodiversityR provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for a large subset of vegan functionality.

The vegan package is developed at GitHub (https://github.com/vegandevs/vegan/). GitHub provides up-to-date information and forums for bug reports. Most important changes in vegan documents can be read with news(package="vegan") and vignettes can be browsed with browseVignettes("vegan"). The vignettes include a vegan FAQ, discussion on design decisions, short introduction to ordination and discussion on diversity methods.

Used macrohabitats were those in which woodpeckers were detected at playback stations. Used microhabitats corresponded to sites showing signs of foraging (i.e., excavated cavities). Pileated Woodpeckers responded to vegetation structure at both scales sampled. Macrohabitats used by woodpeckers had relatively low percentages of mixed shade-intolerant hardwood stands, coniferous stands, and stands of relatively low stem density and tree height, but included high percentages of 51- to 90-year-old stands. Microhabitats used by woodpeckers were characterized most strongly by a high density of large snags but also by a high density of small-diameter snags and a low density of shade-intolerant hardwood trees and coniferous trees [Formula: see text]30 cm diameter at breast height. The concordance between the observed and predicted use of micro- and macro-habitat plots was independent of spatial scale (logistic regression, χ

	abstract = {In the absence of sufficient data from directed studies of old-growth forests in the Acadian Forest Region (AFR), we must rely on a general knowledge of forest ecology and natural succession, population biology, disturbance dynamics, and palynological evidence to understand the probable extent of old-growth, late-successional forest types before European settlement, their role in the biological diversity of Acadian forests, and the silvicultural prescriptions required to maintain a component of such old growth (OG) on the landscape. The structural features of representative Acadian old growth can be understood from the few remaining stands of such forest in the AFR and from studies in the closely related forest types of the Great Lakes  St. Lawrence Forest Region of Canada and other eastern North American temperate-zone forests. Several hundred years of land clearing for agriculture and timber harvesting has eliminated most of the old-growth forests in the Maritime provinces of Canada. Nevertheless, our limited knowledge of OG suggests that, when the average age of the dominant and co-dominant trees of the typical late-successional species associations of the AFR has reached about 150 years, such forests generally appear to have attained most of the structural features commonly associated with old-growth forests (e.g., standing and fallen, dead and dying trees in various stages of decay, a layered, multi-age canopy structure). What little OG remains is largely restricted to small, isolated stands, often associated with steep gorges that were inaccessible to harvesting or areas that were otherwise protected or avoided being harvested. Late-successional, old-growth forest types dominated by relatively shade-tolerant, long-lived species such as sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.), beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.), eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carr.), and red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) and with a significant component of eastern white pine (Pinus strobus L.) and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britt.) often represent the final stages of forest stand development. Such forests may be considered archetypical of OG in the AFR. Forests dominated by these tree species mixtures tend to regenerate naturally in forest canopy gaps left by small-scale disturbances created by fallen individual trees or small groups of trees, rather than the catastrophic, stand-replacing disturbances normally associated with boreal forests. Our objectives were (i) to describe some of the remaining old-growth forest types and their extent in the AFR, (ii) to present some perspectives on their role in biodiversity conservation, and (iii) to present a basis for developing strategies for conservation, management, and restoration. Forest-resource inventories (FRI) suggest that as little as 15\% of present forest cover across the Maritimes is in forest older than 100 years, but our preliminary ground surveys based on this database suggest far less than that is true old-growth forest. Based on expected patterns of ecological succession, disturbance dynamics, and stand development following catastrophic natural disturbance intervals of about 1000 years, and from what the geological record tells us about forest cover before European settlement, we can project that as much as 50\% of Maritime forest landscape may have been dominated by late-successional old-growth forest types over the 40005000 years before European settlement. Recent genetic studies suggest that these old-growth forests were probably a rich source of the genetic diversity required by these tree species to adapt to the environmental (climatic) changes that have characterized the North American continent over the past 2 million years of its glacial history.

	abstract = {Structural complexity generated by forest development processes and tree species compositional changes provide key habitat features for vertebrate communities that rely upon tree size and decay processes for foraging, denning or nesting. Complexity of forest structure in old stands could not only be key for harboring increased taxonomic species diversity but also greater functional diversity through more complexity in networks of tree cavity dependent species. Using a nest web approach that hierarchically links cavity-bearing trees with cavity formation agents (natural decay processes and avian excavators) and cavity users (non-excavator species), we compared network characteristics of nest webs along a time since fire gradient in a naturally disturbed boreal mixedwood forest landscape in eastern North America. Since 2003, twelve 24 to 40 ha plots ranging from 61 to more than 245 years after fire were surveyed at the Lake Duparquet Research and Teaching Forest in Abitibi, Quebec, Canada to detect active nesting, and denning cavities. We found that network complexity both in terms of number of vertebrate species and number of interactions among species, increased along the age gradient and was significantly higher in the older stands than predicted by chance. Whereas cavity-nesting communities in old forests used a higher diversity of tree species over a wide range of decay stages, trembling aspen remained a key cavity-bearing tree throughout the age gradient. Woodpeckers were the main cavity formation agents whereas less than 1\% of cavities originated from natural decay. The structural development of older forests is thus a driver for functional diversity in cavity-using vertebrate communities through higher interaction richness in nest webs, among cavity-bearing trees, excavators and non-excavating users. The pivotal contribution of the entire gradient of old forest cover types to the overall complexity of nest webs in the boreal mixedwood zone is also a key for the resilience of the cavity-using vertebrate community to natural disturbances. We discuss how such resilience may be compromised by even-aged industrial timber harvesting with short rotations that shifts the age structure of boreal landscapes toward regenerating and young pole forests whereas old forest cover types become below their historical range of variability.},

	abstract = {Conceptual confusion revolves around how to define, assess, and overcome land, ecosystem, and landscape degradation. Common elements link degradation and recovery processes, offering ways to advance local, regional, and global initiatives to reduce degradation and promote the recovery of ecosystems and landscapes in forest biomes. Biophysical attributes of degradation and recovery can be measured, but the relevance of selected attributes across scales is subject to values that determine preferred states. Degradation defined in the context of a resilience-based approach is a state where the capacity for regeneration is greatly reduced or lost, recovery is arrested, core interactions and feedbacks are broken, and human intervention is required to initiate a trajectory of recovery. Another approach combines degradation and recovery processes through the concept of recovery debt, the cumulative lost benefits incurred, relative to a target state during phases of degradation and recovery. Degradation and recovery can also be described in terms of societal willingness to invest in improved management or restoration. Interventions can facilitate recovery to new stable or persistent states that provide multiple social and ecological benefits at land, ecosystem, and landscape scales. Multiple trajectories of recovery, as well as historic and ongoing chronic environmental change, might, however, mean that recovery to an original reference state is not possible.},

However, the effects of different intensities of extreme climatic events on vegetation phenology remain poorly understood. Using a long-term solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence dataset, we investigated the response of vegetation phenology to extreme temperatures and precipitation events of different intensities across the Tibetan Plateau (TP) from 2000 to 2018. We found that the effect of maximum temperature exposure days (TxED) and minimum temperature exposure days (TnED) on the start of the growing season (SOS) was initially delayed and shifted to advance along the increasing temperature gradients. However, the response of the end of the growing season (EOS) to TxED and TnED shifted from an advance to a delay with increasing temperature gradients until the temperature thresholds were reached, above which thresholds produced an unfavorable response to vegetation growth and brought the EOS to an early end. The corresponding maximum and minimum temperature thresholds were 10.12 and 2.54°C, respectively. In contrast, cumulative precipitation (CP) was more likely to advance SOS and delay EOS as the precipitation gradient increased, but the advance of SOS is gradually weakening. Four vegetation types (i.e., forest, shrubland, meadow, and steppe) showed similar trends in response to different climates, but the optimal climatic conditions varied between the vegetation types. Generally, meadow and steppe had lower optimal temperatures and precipitation than forest and shrubland. These findings revealed the divergent responses of vegetation phenology to extreme climate events of different intensities, implying that the SOS will continue to advance with warming, whereas the EOS may undergo a partial transformation from delayed areas to advanced areas with continued warming.},

Here we report an Illumina short-read 369X coverage, draft de novo heterozygous genome sequence of V. riparia Michx. ‘Manitoba 37’ with the size of {\textasciitilde}495 Mb for 69,616 scaffolds and a N50 length of 518,740 bp. Using RNAseq data, 40,019 coding sequences were predicted and annotated. Benchmarking with Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) analysis of predicted gene models found 96\% of the complete BUSCOs in this assembly. The assembly continuity and completeness were further validated using V. riparia ESTs, BACs, and three de novo transcriptome assemblies of three different V. riparia genotypes resulting in \&gt;98\% of respective sequences/transcripts mapping with this assembly. Alignment of the V. riparia assembly and predicted CDS with the latest V. vinifera ‘PN40024’ CDS and genome assembly showed 99\% CDS alignment and a high degree of synteny. An analysis of plant transcription factors indicates a high degree of homology with the V. vinifera transcription factors. QTL mapping to V. riparia ‘Manitoba 37’ and V. vinifera PN40024 has identified genetic relationships to phenotypic variation between species. This assembly provides reference sequences, gene models for marker development and understanding V. riparia’s genetic contributions in grape breeding and research.},

Despite the importance of V. berlandieri for European viticulture, only a few accessions have so far been exploited for breeding rootstocks. In most cases, these vines were only used because they were available in Europe at that time. The genetic variability of the species is certainly much larger. To preserve and evaluate genetic diversity in V. berlandieri, grape berries from 86 individual vines were collected in September 2005 from a large range of natural stands in Texas, United States. The collection locations were found in 13 counties and across a distribution from N 31° 23’ to N 29° 43’ and W 100° 2’ to W 97° 26’.

	abstract = {Dead and decaying trees may be a limited resource for woodpeckers in managed forests, especially for species that rely on dead wood for nesting and foraging. Whereas recent nest web studies greatly increased our understanding of nest tree use by woodpeckers, knowledge on woodpeckers foraging requirements is much less developed. We quantified and compared tree selection patterns and foraging behavior of six bark-foraging woodpeckers – downy woodpecker (Picoides pubescens), hairy woodpecker (Picoides villosus), American three-toed woodpecker (Picoides dorsalis), black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), yellow-bellied sapsucker (Sphyropicus varius) and pileated woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus) – that co-occur in eastern boreal forests of North America. A total of 271 observation bouts and more than 600 foraging trees were recorded at three study sites characterized as mixedwood, conifer, and burn. Our results show that dead wood represents an important foraging substrate for most bark-foraging woodpeckers in Canadian eastern boreal forests. However, significant differences in individual species were found with regard to substrate use patterns, foraging behavior and associated prey. Woodpeckers were categorized according to their selection for specific stages of tree degradation, with the yellow-bellied sapsucker and the pileated woodpecker representing opposite ends of this gradient. The black-backed woodpecker showed the highest use of dead wood and was very specific in its tree selection by using mostly recently dead trees. We emphasize that providing foraging substrates for most woodpecker species not only requires maintaining dead wood but also paying heed to the underlying dynamics of dead wood (e.g. recruitment and degradation) in managed boreal forest landscapes.},

We developed a resource selection function (RSF), validated by a resampling procedure, and compared selection ratios for significant predictors.

	abstract = {Among boreal forest bird species, the three-toed woodpecker (Picoidestridactylus)is closely associated with old-growth forests ({\textgreater}120 years), and possibly the most negatively affected by long-term changes induced by commercial forestry in eastern Canada. Part of this conflict is related to the woodpecker's use of standing dead trees as nesting sites. Moreover, this woodpecker's foraging behavior and its choice of feeding and drumming substrates may increase its vulnerability in managed forests. We describe foraging behavior of three-toed woodpeckers, and characterize foraging and drumming trees used by this species in Quebec's black spruce (Picea mariana) forests. During summer (May-Jul) and mid-winter (Jan-Feb), birds of both sexes used a highly specialized feeding technique consistent with searching for bark beetles (Coleoptera: Scolytidae). Snags were highly preferred over live trees as foraging substrates. Snags used for foraging had a greater diameter at breast height (dbh) and were less deteriorated than paired nearest available snags. When live trees were selected for foraging, they also had a greater dbh but were more deteriorated than nearest available live trees. Thus, only a limited number of trees had all characteristics preferred by foraging woodpeckers, probably as a result of the ecology of its phloem-boring prey. Snags also were highly preferred over live trees as drumming substrates. Drumming snags differed from paired nearest available snags by having a broken top, less bark cover, and a lower deterioration class, which probably provided better acoustic towers for territorial birds. Given the extensive use of snags with different characteristics for foraging and drumming by three-toed woodpeckers, models estimating snag requirements for this species based only on nesting requirements are probably of limited use to maintain populations in managed areas. Wildlife habitat management objectives that specifically require the maintenance and renewal of snags in early decaying stages found in old-growth forests are essential to the conservation of this woodpecker species in managed forests.},

We examined the response of both European three-toed woodpecker subspecies Picoides tridactylus tridactylus and P. tr. alpinus to different amounts of dead wood in a boreal and a sub-Alpine coniferous forest landscape in central Sweden and Switzerland, respectively. Habitat variables were measured by fieldwork in forests with breeding woodpeckers (n=10+12) and in control forests without breeding woodpeckers (n=10+12) in the same landscape. Logistic regression analyses revealed steep thresholds for the amount of dead standing trees and the probability of three-toed woodpecker presence in both Sweden and Switzerland. The probability of the presence of three-toed woodpeckers increased from 0.10 to 0.95 when snag basal area increased from 0.6 to 1.3 m2ha−1 in Switzerland and from 0.3 to 0.5 m2ha−1 in central Sweden. In Switzerland, a high road network density was negatively correlated to the presence of woodpeckers (r=−0.65, p=0.0007). The higher volumes of dead wood in Switzerland, where population trends are more positive, than in central Sweden, where the population is declining, would suggest that the volumes of dead wood in managed forests in Sweden are too low to sustain three-toed woodpeckers in the long-term. In terms of management implications, we suggest a quantitative target of at least 5\% of standing trees in older forests being dead over at least 100 ha large forest areas. This corresponds about to ⩾1.3 m2ha−1 (basal area) or ⩾15 m3ha−1 (volume), still depending on site productivity.},

	abstract = {Breeding birds in North America’s eastern and boreal forests have experienced significant population declines in recent decades due largely to habitat loss. The North American Great Lakes coastal zone provides critical stopover and breeding habitat for millions of migratory and resident birds with diverse life history traits. Extensive human land use in this region has resulted in significant forest loss. To understand how functional and taxonomic diversity of breeding bird communities have been affected by agriculture and urbanization in this region, we calculated measures of functional diversity, Shannon’s diversity index, and species richness along a gradient of human land use intensity. We analyzed bird survey data collected at 2982 locations within 1 km of the shoreline where upland forest was the dominant habitat. We used hierarchical partitioning to determine the extent to which spatial confounding factors (i.e., broad climatic and biogeographic gradients across the five Great Lakes) accounted for observed differences in diversity measures, and then used fourth-corner analysis to describe the relationship between species, functional traits, and land cover types. Although spatial confounding factors accounted for some variation, functional evenness, species richness, and Shannon’s diversity index declined significantly with increasing human land use. Species negatively associated with increasing human land use were those that eat primarily invertebrates by foraging on foliage or bark (75\%) and species categorized as long-distance migrants (58\%), which suggests increased vulnerability of forest-dependent species to habitat modification and reductions in habitat availability. Functional evenness declined with increasing human land use, while other measures of functional diversity (functional dispersion and Rao’s quadratic entropy) remained relatively constant. Understanding the disconnect between functional and taxonomic diversity of bird assemblages and quantifying the degree of resilience of functional community properties is critical for predicting long-term effects of both habitat loss and ecological restoration on biodiversity and ecosystem function.},

A more promising approach is to quantify the contributions of alpha and beta diversity to regional diversity (the ABR approach) using additive partitioning. We applied this approach to four local–regional relationships based on data from 583 arboreal beetle species collected in a hierarchically nested sampling design. All four local–regional relationships exhibited proportional sampling, yet the ABR approach indicated that each was produced by a different combination of alpha and beta richness. Using the results of the ABR analysis, we also analysed the scale dependence of alpha and beta using a hierarchical linear model. Alpha diversity contributed less than expected to regional diversity at the finest spatial scale and more than expected at the broadest spatial scale. A switch in relative dominance from beta to alpha diversity with increasing spatial scale suggested scale transitions in ecological processes. Analysing the scale dependence of diversity components using the ABR approach furthers our understanding about the additivity of species diversity in biological communities.},

	abstract = {There is growing concern over rates of global species diversity loss and its implications on healthy ecosystem functioning. While positive relationships between tree species diversity and forest biomass production have been observed, forests are structurally complex, consisting of understorey vegetation layers that also contribute to ecosystem functioning as they often account for the majority of species richness. However, relationships between understorey vegetation diversity and function are largely unexplored. Further, few studies have simultaneously assessed how both overstorey and understory vegetation interact and contribute to overall ecosystem function. By analysing Canada's National Forest Inventory data base using structural equation modelling, we explored the relationships between species richness and above-ground biomass production across forest vegetation strata while accounting for potentially confounding factors, including climate, physical site characteristics and forest ageing. We found positive relationships between species richness and biomass production across all forest vegetation layers, but the relationship was strongest for the overstorey layer. Species richness of the understorey tree, shrub and herb layers was positively related to overstorey species richness. However, overstorey biomass had a negative effect on the biomass production of all understorey layers. Our results suggest that resource filtering by overstorey trees might have reduced the strength of the positive diversity–productivity relationships in the forest understorey, supporting previous hypotheses that the magnitude and direction of diversity–productivity relationships is context specific and dependent on the conditions of the surrounding environment. Further, heterogeneity in understory resources, as affected by the overstorey, may promote niche complementarity as the main mechanism driving diversity–productivity relationships in understorey vegetation.},

Here, we integrate phylogenies and traits to evaluate the effects of elevational diversity on above-ground biomass across forest strata and spatial scales. Community-weighted means of height and leaf phosphorous concentration and functional diversity in specific leaf area exhibited positive correlations with tree biomass, suggesting that both positive selection effects and complementarity occur. However, high shrub biomass is associated with greater dissimilarity in seed mass and multidimensional trait space, while species richness or phylogenetic diversity is the most important predictor for herbaceous biomass, indicating that species complementarity is especially important for understory function. The strength of diversity-biomass relationships increases at larger spatial scales. We conclude that strata- and scale- dependent assessments of community structure and function are needed to fully understand how biodiversity influences ecosystem function.},

However, the quantity and quality of these structural attributes in old forest stands are likely to be influenced by important latitudinal changes in tree species composition and productivity from the southern boreal mixed to the northern coniferous forests. We measured habitat occupancy of cavity and bark nesting birds in old forests when the boreal forest landscape shifts from a mixed to a dominant coniferous matrix in the Clay Belt of Québec and Ontario, a region where paludification dominates. Using playback calls, songs, and recent woodpeckers’ foraging signs on trees, we measured the occurrence and foraging habitat use of 11 bird species associated with deadwood in 86 unmanaged forest stands along a forest age gradient in both mixed and coniferous stands. In coniferous stands dominated by black spruce, deadwood birds showed a modal distribution in response to the aging of black spruce forests that reached a peak in stands of 160years and then declined. Unproductive paludified stands, which made up more than 40\% of our study area, were associated with a significantly lower species richness of deadwood birds. At the opposite, although they represented less than 4\% of the forest cover in our study area, old boreal mixedwood forests ({\textgreater}90years) were highly utilized habitats by deadwood birds. Structural diversity of trees (diversity of degradation stages and diameter of trees) was the variable that best explained species richness of this functional group of birds whereas at the individual species level, the quantity and quality of dead trees (degradation and size) in stands best explained species occurrence and abundance of foraging signs. Conservation efforts for deadwood birds should focus on old productive stands of both mixed and coniferous composition. However, our study pinpoints old mixedwood stand as habitats of special concern given their disproportionate importance for deadwood birds in northern boreal forests.},

	abstract = {Widespread tree mortality associated with drought has been observed on all forested continents and global change is expected to exacerbate vegetation vulnerability. Forest mortality has implications for future biosphere–atmosphere interactions of carbon, water and energy balance, and is poorly represented in dynamic vegetation models. Reducing uncertainty requires improved mortality projections founded on robust physiological processes. However, the proposed mechanisms of drought-induced mortality, including hydraulic failure and carbon starvation, are unresolved. A growing number of empirical studies have investigated these mechanisms, but data have not been consistently analysed across species and biomes using a standardized physiological framework. Here, we show that xylem hydraulic failure was ubiquitous across multiple tree taxa at drought-induced mortality. All species assessed had 60\% or higher loss of xylem hydraulic conductivity, consistent with proposed theoretical and modelled survival thresholds. We found diverse responses in non-structural carbohydrate reserves at mortality, indicating that evidence supporting carbon starvation was not universal. Reduced non-structural carbohydrates were more common for gymnosperms than angiosperms, associated with xylem hydraulic vulnerability, and may have a role in reducing hydraulic function. Our finding that hydraulic failure at drought-induced mortality was persistent across species indicates that substantial improvement in vegetation modelling can be achieved using thresholds in hydraulic function.
The mechanisms underlying drought-induced tree mortality are not fully resolved. Here, the authors show that, across multiple tree species, loss of xylem conductivity above 60\% is associated with mortality, while carbon starvation is not universal.},

	abstract = {More frequent drought episodes are expected to cause higher mortality in isohydric tree species such as pines, because individuals close their stomata early during drought in order to maintain constant needle water potentials. It has been suggested that trees delay the ensuing carbon starvation by actively storing carbon at the expense of growth (“bet hedging”). Because such a strategy is only adaptive in drought‐prone regions, we hypothesise that the degree of carbon “bet hedging” should differ between ecotypes. We repeatedly measured the allocation of biomass, starch and soluble sugars to needles, stem and roots in seedlings of nine populations of Pinus sylvestris and Pinus nigra along a gradient from Central Europe to the Mediterranean. During two consecutive growing seasons, seedlings grown from seed were exposed to factorial combinations of 4 months of drought (D1, D2) and ambient/elevated CO2 (aCO2/eCO2). Drought‐stressed pine seedlings did neither increase starch concentrations, nor change biomass production or experience lower mortality under eCO2 compared to aCO2. By the end of D2, seedlings from drier origin had accumulated more starch but at the same time also more biomass than seedlings from wetter origin. Surprisingly, seedlings acclimatised to dry conditions after D1 so that mortality dropped to zero and drought effects on needle starch (P. sylvestris) and overall starch (P. nigra), respectively, disappeared after D2. Synthesis. The absence of a trade‐off between carbon storage (starch) and growth (biomass), and the patterns of mortality observed in seedlings growing under combined drought and eCO2 do not support the theory of carbon “bet hedging” in isohydric Pinus sylvestris and Pinus nigra. Results suggest that reduced growth and acclimatisation minimised seedling mortality in the second year. Acclimatisation might thus enable pine seedlings to resist a moderate increase in summer drought frequency expected in the future.},

We completely darkened and subsequently released seedlings of two deciduous and two evergreen temperate tree species for varying periods. NSCs were measured in all major organs, allowing assessment of whole-seedling NSC balances. NSCs decreased fast in darkness, but seedlings survived species-specific whole-seedling starch concentrations as low as 0.4-0.8\% per dry matter (DM), and sugar (sucrose, glucose and fructose) concentrations as low as 0.5-2.0\% DM. After re-illumination, the refilling of NSC pools began within 3 wk, while the resumption of growth was delayed or restricted. All seedlings had died after 12 wk of darkness, and starch and sugar concentrations in most tissues were lower than 1\% DM. We conclude that under the applied conditions, tree seedlings can survive several weeks with very low NSC reserves probably also using alternative C sources like lipids, proteins or hemicelluloses; lethal C starvation cannot be assumed, if NSC concentrations are higher than the minimum concentrations found in surviving seedlings; and NSC reformation after re-illumination occurs preferentially over growth.},

	abstract = {Drought-related tree die-off episodes have been observed in all vegetated continents. Despite much research effort, however, the multiple interactions between carbon starvation, hydraulic failure and biotic agents in driving tree mortality under field conditions are still not well understood. We analysed the seasonal variability of non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) in four organs (leaves, branches, trunk and roots), the vulnerability to embolism in roots and branches, native embolism (percentage loss of hydraulic conductivity (PLC)) in branches and the presence of root rot pathogens in defoliated and non-defoliated individuals in a declining Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) population in the NE Iberian Peninsula in 2012, which included a particularly dry and warm summer. No differences were observed between defoliated and non-defoliated pines in hydraulic parameters, except for a higher vulnerability to embolism at pressures below -2 MPa in roots of defoliated pines. No differences were found between defoliation classes in branch PLC. Total NSC (TNSC, soluble sugars plus starch) values decreased during drought, particularly in leaves. Defoliation reduced TNSC levels across tree organs, especially just before (June) and during (August) drought. Root rot infection by the fungal pathogen Onnia P. Karst spp. was detected but it did not appear to be associated to tree defoliation. However, Onnia infection was associated with reduced leaf-specific hydraulic conductivity and sapwood depth, and thus contributed to hydraulic impairment, especially in defoliated pines. Infection was also associated with virtually depleted root starch reserves during and after drought in defoliated pines. Moreover, defoliated and infected trees tended to show lower basal area increment. Overall, our results show the intertwined nature of physiological mechanisms leading to drought-induced mortality and the inherent difficulty of isolating their contribution under field conditions.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims The relationship between plant carbon economy and drought responses of co-occurring woody species can be assessed by comparing carbohydrate (C) dynamics following drought and rain periods, relating these dynamics to species' functional traits. We studied nine woody species coexisting in a continental Mediterranean shrubland that experienced severe drought effects followed by rain. Methods We measured total non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) and soluble sugars (SS) in roots and stems during drought and after an autumn rain pulse in plants exhibiting leaf loss and in undefoliated ones. We explored whether their dynamics were related to foliage recovery and functional traits (height [H], specific leaf area [SLA], wood density [WD]). Key Results During drought, NSC concentrations were overall lower in stems and roots of plants experiencing leaf loss, while SS decreases were smaller. Roots had higher NSC concentrations than stems. After the rain, NSC concentrations continued to decrease, while SS increased. Green foliage recovered after rain, particularly in plants previously experiencing higher leaf loss, independently of NSC concentrations during drought. Species with lower WD tended to have more SS during drought and lower SS increases after rain. In low-WD species, plants with severe leaf loss had lower NSC relative to undefoliated ones. No significant relationship was found between H or SLA and C content or dynamics. Conclusions Our community-level study reveals that, while responses were species-specific, C stocks overall diminished in plants affected by prolonged drought and did not increase after a pulse of seasonal rain. Dynamics were faster for SS than NSC. We found limited depletion of SS, consistent with their role in basal metabolic, transport and signalling functions. In a scenario of increased drought under climate change, NSC stocks in woody plants are expected to decrease differentially in coexisting species, with potential implications for their adaptive abilities and community dynamics.},

	abstract = {Gas exchange, growth, water transport and carbon (C) metabolism diminish during drought according to their respective sensitivities to declining water status. The timing of this sequence of declining physiological functions may determine how water and C relations compromise plant survival. In this paper, we test the hypothesis that the degree of asynchrony between declining C supply (photosynthesis) and C demand (growth and respiration) determines the rate and magnitude of changes in whole-plant non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) during drought. Two complementary experiments using two tree species (Eucalyptus globulus Labill. and Pinus radiata D. Don) with contrasting drought response strategies were performed to (i) assess changes in radial stem growth, transpiration, leaf water potential and gas exchange in response to chronic drought, and (ii) evaluate the concomitant impacts of these drought responses on the temporal patterns of NSC during terminal drought. The three distinct phases of water stress were delineated by thresholds of growth cessation and stomatal closure that defined the 'carbon safety margin' (i.e., the difference between leaf water potential when growth is zero and leaf water potential when net photosynthesis is zero). A wider C safety margin in E. globulus was defined by an earlier cessation of growth relative to photosynthesis that reduced the demand for NSC while maintaining C acquisition. By contrast, the narrower C safety margin in P. radiata was characterized by a synchronous decline in growth and photosynthesis, whereby growth continued under a declining supply of NSC from photosynthesis. The narrower C safety margin in P. radiata was associated with declines in starch concentrations after ∼ 90 days of chronic drought and significant depletion of starch in all organs at mortality. The observed divergence in the sensitivity of drought responses is indicative of a potential trade-off between maintaining hydraulic safety and adequate C availability.},

	abstract = {Plants store large amounts of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC). While multiple functions of NSC have long been recognized, the interpretation of NSC seasonal dynamics is often based on the idea that stored NSC is a reservoir of carbon that fluctuates depending on the balance between supply via photosynthesis and demand for growth and respiration (the source–sink dynamics concept). Consequently, relatively high NSC concentrations in some plants have been interpreted to reflect excess supply relative to demand. An alternative view, however, is that NSC accumulation reflects the relatively high NSC levels required for plant survival; an important issue that remains highly controversial. Here, we assembled a new global database to examine broad patterns of seasonal NSC variation across organs (leaves, stems, and belowground), plant functional types (coniferous, drought-deciduous angiosperms, winter deciduous angiosperms, evergreen angiosperms, and herbaceous) and biomes (boreal, temperate, Mediterranean, and tropical). We compiled data from 121 studies, including seasonal measurements for 177 species under natural conditions. Our results showed that, on average, NSC account for 10\% of dry plant biomass and are highest in leaves and lowest in stems, whereas belowground organs show intermediate concentrations. Total NSC, starch, and soluble sugars (SS) varied seasonally, with a strong depletion of starch during the growing season and a general increase during winter months, particularly in boreal and temperate biomes. Across functional types, NSC concentrations were highest and most variable in herbaceous species and in conifer needles. Conifers showed the lowest stem and belowground NSC concentrations. Minimum NSC values were relatively high (46\% of seasonal maximums on average for total NSC) and, in contrast to average values, were similar among biomes and functional types. Overall, although starch depletion was relatively common, seasonal depletion of total NSC or SS was rare. These results are consistent with a dual view of NSC function: whereas starch acts mostly as a reservoir for future use, soluble sugars perform immediate functions (e.g., osmoregulation) and are kept above some critical threshold. If confirmed, this dual function of NSC will have important implications for the way we understand and model plant carbon allocation and survival under stress.},

	abstract = {Carbon (C) storage is considered a key component to plant survival under drought and shade, although the combined effects of these factors on survival remain poorly understood. We investigated how drought and shade alter the C dynamics and survival of tree seedlings, and whether drought limits the access to or usage of stored C. We experimentally applied two levels of soil humidity (well-watered versus drought, the latter induced by dry-down) and light availability (light versus complete darkness) on 1-year-old seedlings of Acer pseudoplatanus L. for 3 months. We quantified the survival, biomass, growth rate and non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) of seedlings at their time of death or at the end of the experiment for those that survived. We found that the soil dried out faster when drought was combined with light than when it was combined with complete darkness. Seedlings subjected to both drought and light showed reduced growth and reached 100\% mortality earlier than any other treatment, with the highest NSC concentrations at the time of death. Seedlings exposed to both drought and complete darkness died significantly earlier than seedlings exposed to complete darkness only, but had similar NSC concentrations at time of their death, suggesting that drought accelerated the use of stored C under complete darkness. Complete darkness significantly reduced seedling growth and whole-plant NSC concentrations regardless of soil humidity, while root NSC concentrations were significantly more reduced when complete darkness was combined with drought conditions. Thus, the C dynamics in A. pseudoplatanus seedlings under complete darkness was not hindered by drought, i.e., the access and use of stored C was not limited by drought. The contrasting growth and C storage responses driven by drought under light versus complete darkness are consistent with a key role of the drought progression in the C dynamics of trees.},

	abstract = {Stored non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) have been proposed as a key determinant of drought resistance in plants. However, the evidence for this role is controversial, as it comes mostly from observational, short-term studies. Here, we take advantage of a long-term experimental throughfall reduction to elucidate the response of NSC to increased drought 14 years after the beginning of the treatment in three Mediterranean resprouter trees (Quercus ilex L., Arbutus unedo L. and Phillyrea latifolia L.). In addition, we selected 20 Q. ilex individuals outside the experimental plots to directly assess the relationship between defoliation and NSC at the individual level. We measured the seasonal course of NSC concentrations in leaves, branches and lignotuber in late winter, late spring, summer, and autumn 2012. Total concentrations of NSC were highest in the lignotuber for all species. In the long-term drought experiment we found significant depletion in concentrations of total NSC in treatment plots only in the lignotuber of A. unedo. At the same time, A. unedo was the only species showing a significant reduction in BAI under the drought treatment during the 14 years of the experiment. By contrast, Q. ilex just reduced stem growth only during the first 4 years of treatment and P. latifolia remained unaffected over the whole study period. However, we found a clear association between the concentrations of NSC and defoliation in Q. ilex individuals sampled outside the experimental plots, with lower total concentrations of NSC and lower proportion of starch in defoliated individuals. Taken together, our results suggest that stabilizing processes, probably at the stand level, may have been operating in the long-term to mitigate any impact of drought on NSC levels, and highlight the necessity to incorporate long-term experimental studies of plant responses to drought.},

However, we largely lack knowledge on how drought effects on new assimilate allocation differ between species with different drought sensitivities and how these effects are modified by interspecific competition. We assessed the fate of (13) C labelled assimilates in above- and belowground plant organs and in root/rhizosphere respired CO2 in saplings of drought-tolerant Norway maple (Acer platanoides) and drought-sensitive European beech (Fagus sylvatica) exposed to moderate drought, either in mono- or mixed culture. While drought reduced stomatal conductance and photosynthesis rates in both species, both maintained assimilate transport belowground. Beech even allocated more new assimilate to the roots under moderate drought compared to non-limited water supply conditions, and this pattern was even more pronounced under interspecific competition. Even though maple was a superior competitor compared to beech under non-limited soil water conditions, as indicated by the changes in above- and belowground biomass of both species in the interspecific competition treatments, we can state that beech was still able to efficiently allocate new assimilate belowground under combined drought and interspecific competition. This might be seen as a strategy to maintain root osmotic potential and to prioritise root functioning. Our results thus show that beech tolerates moderate drought stress plus competition without losing its ability to supply belowground tissues. It remains to be explored in future work if this strategy is also valid during long-term drought exposure.},

	abstract = {Plants are sessile organisms that, once germinated, have to cope with in situ environmental conditions for the rest of their life span. These conditions may be favourable for growth and development but may also be constraining or even harmful for their survival. Hence plants must employ available resources most strategically to optimize growth and development and to avoid stress and reduce harm or damage. In this context carbon (C) plays a central role as it is one of the most abundant and most versatile elements involved in plant metabolism. During photosynthesis carbon dioxide (CO2) is taken up from the air and converted to nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC) that serve as both energy carrier and as a building block for anabolic processes like growth, defence or exchanges with other organisms (Hartmann \& Trumbore, 2016). The partitioning of the primary products of photosynthesis into different functional pools is termed carbon (C) allocation and has been subject of investigations for many decades. For example, early botanists studied plant allocation responses as changes in growth patterns following manipulations like branch removal (Hartig, 1878). Several conceptual frameworks were developed decades ago to describe plant allocation strategies in terms of a functional equilibrium between aboveground and belowground organ biomass (Brouwer, 1963). Allocation has also been described as a trade-off in resource partitioning between different functional sinks, like growth and defence in the presence of herbivores and pathogens (Herms \& Mattson, 1992). Mooney (1972) stated almost 50 years ago that ‘through a quantitative understanding of how different plants gain and allocate their resources it will be possible tomake predictions as to their success in any given physical environment in combination with any competitor and predator’. Understanding how C allocation is regulated is thus key for predicting plant responses to environmental changes (Dietze et al., 2014) and consequences for ecosystem functioning (Br€ uggemann et al., 2011). Yet, almost 50 years after Mooney (1972) our knowledge of the regulatorymechanisms ofC allocation is still poor due the complexity in assessing important C allocation components, in particular fluxes among metabolic processes, like photosynthesis, respiration or root exudation, and between different biomass pools, like primary and secondary metabolites (Poorter et al., 2012).},

	abstract = {Drought reduces the carbon (C) assimilation of trees and decouples aboveground from belowground carbon fluxes, but little is known about the response of drought-stressed trees to rewetting. This study aims to assess dynamics and patterns of C allocation in beech saplings under dry and rewetted soil conditions. In October 2010, 5-year-old beech saplings from a forest site were transplanted into 20 l pots. In 2011, the saplings were subjected to different levels of soil drought ranging from non-limiting water supply (control) to severe water limitation with soil water potentials of less than -1.5 MPa. As a physiologically relevant measure of drought, the cumulated soil water potential (i.e., drought stress dose (DSD)) was calculated for the growing season. In late August, the saplings were transferred into a climate chamber and pulse-labeled with (13)C-depleted CO2 (δ(13)C of -47‰). Isotopic signatures in leaf and soil respiration were repeatedly measured. Five days after soil rewetting, a second label was applied using 99 atom\% (13)CO2. After another 12 days, the fate of assimilated C in each sapling was assessed by calculating the (13)C mass balance. Photosynthesis decreased by 60\% in saplings under severe drought. The mean residence time (MRT) of recent assimilates in leaf respiration was more than three times longer than under non-limited conditions and was positively correlated to DSD. Also, the appearance of the label in soil respiration was delayed. Within 5 days after rewetting, photosynthesis, MRT of recent assimilates in leaf respiration and appearance of the label in soil respiration recovered fully. Despite the fast recovery, less label was recovered in the biomass of the previously drought-stressed plants, which also allocated less C to the root compartment (45 vs 64\% in the control). We conclude that beech saplings quickly recover from extreme soil drought, although transitional after-effects prevail in C allocation, possibly due to repair-driven respiratory processes.},

	abstract = {The ongoing climate change is characterized by increased temperatures and altered precipitation patterns. In addition, there has been an increase in both the frequency and intensity of extreme climatic events such as drought. Episodes of drought induce a series of interconnected effects, all of which have the potential to alter the carbon balance of forest ecosystems profoundly at different scales of plant organization and ecosystem functioning. During recent years, considerable progress has been made in the understanding of how aboveground parts of trees respond to drought and how these responses affect carbon assimilation. In contrast, processes of belowground parts are relatively underrepresented in research on climate change. In this review, we describe current knowledge about responses of tree roots to drought. Tree roots are capable of responding to drought through a variety of strategies that enable them to avoid and tolerate stress. Responses include root biomass adjustments, anatomical alterations, and physiological acclimations. The molecular mechanisms underlying these responses are characterized to some extent, and involve stress signaling and the induction of numerous genes, leading to the activation of tolerance pathways. In addition, mycorrhizas seem to play important protective roles. The current knowledge compiled in this review supports the view that tree roots are well equipped to withstand drought situations and maintain morphological and physiological functions as long as possible. Further, the reviewed literature demonstrates the important role of tree roots in the functioning of forest ecosystems and highlights the need for more research in this emerging field.},

	abstract = {Abstract Understanding physiological processes involved in drought‐induced mortality is important for predicting the future of forests and for modelling the carbon and water cycles. Recent research has highlighted the variable risks of carbon starvation and hydraulic failure in drought‐exposed trees. However, little is known about the specific responses of leaves and supporting twigs, despite their critical role in balancing carbon acquisition and water loss. Comparing healthy (non‐defoliated) and unhealthy (defoliated) Scots pine at the same site, we measured the physiological variables involved in regulating carbon and water resources. Defoliated trees showed different responses to summer drought compared with non‐defoliated trees. Defoliated trees maintained gas exchange while non‐defoliated trees reduced photosynthesis and transpiration during the drought period. At the branch scale, very few differences were observed in non‐structural carbohydrate concentrations between health classes. However, defoliated trees tended to have lower water potentials and smaller hydraulic safety margins. While non‐defoliated trees showed a typical response to drought for an isohydric species, the physiology appears to be driven in defoliated trees by the need to maintain carbon resources in twigs. These responses put defoliated trees at higher risk of branch hydraulic failure and help explain the interaction between carbon starvation and hydraulic failure in dying trees.},

	abstract = {Adverse health effects of exposure to particles have been described in numerous epidemiological studies. Health endpoints thoroughly studied are all cause and cause-specific mortality, and hospital admissions. Older studies focussed on associations with PM10 (then named fine particles). During the last decade, PM2.5 was increasingly emphasised, and the term “fine particles” was restricted to this size fraction. Currently, ultrafine particles (UF, PM0.1) are discussed to be another important fraction which should be characterised by particle number instead of particle mass. However, data on UF exposure and health effects are still limited. The mechanisms by which particles influence human health are only poorly understood. Under discussion is the role of particle size and particle composition. The risk assessment of coarse particles (i.e. the size fraction between 2.5 and 10μm) suffers from inconsistent findings. The question of causality is not completely answered. However, it is widely accepted that PM is some kind of container including components which are toxicologically relevant and others which might be seen mainly as indicators. Thus, the local mix may influence the toxicological potency of PM, and results from studies carried out in one region may not necessarily be consistent with results gained elsewhere. Recently, reanalyses of epidemiological studies performed by the Health Effects Institute (HEI) qualitatively confirmed the original results. New insight in the influence of socioeconomic factors extended the knowledge on health effects of particles. To some extent, the slope of the dose response relationships from time-series analyses needed downward adjustment due to some problems with statistical analysis programmes. Nevertheless, the whole body of knowledge supports the role of PM as a type of air pollution with great influence on human health.},

Spotted bowerbirds, Chlamydera maculata, are atypical in having widely spaced display sites, bowers that are greatly diverged from those of closely related species, and extremely intense, aggressive displays. Results from the continuous monitoring of bowers show that (1) a few males account for the majority of matings, (2) the two most common decoration types, bones and glass, explain a large proportion of the variation in male mating success and (3) large inter-bower distances relate to low levels of decoration stealing and bower destruction. Components of male mating success, male ability to attract female visitors to the bower, and male courtship success correlate respectively with counts of bones and glass. Bones are spread widely around the bower and glass is placed close to it supporting the hypothesis that bones act to attract females towards the bower and glass functions later to stimulate females in the bower. This temporal sequencing of courtship functions represents a novel explanation for the evolution of complex male display traits.},

	abstract = {Despite strong selective pressures inherent in competition for mates, in species with non-resource-based mating systems males commonly engage in non-agonistic interactions with same-sex visitors at display arenas. Bowerbirds perform courtship dances on elaborate display structures — known as bowers — that are built and defended by one resident male. Several reports have suggested that bower owners tolerate the presence of specific male visitors at their display arenas, referred to here as ‘subordinates’. Subordinate males may learn the skills required for successful sexual signalling via prolonged social interactions at adults’ arenas, but little is known about whether courtship proficiency changes with experience and/or whether subordinates actively contribute to enhancing the resident male’s mating success. In this study, we investigated male-male associations in wild spotted bowerbirds (Ptilonorhynchus maculatus). We first sought to determine whether courtship behaviour differs based on bower ownership status. We then examined whether social interactions between bower owners and subordinate males may qualify as courtship coalitions. Our analysis of courtship postural components did not reveal differences in timing or relative occurrence of postural components between subordinate males and bower owners, whereas we found evidence that male-male associations in spotted bowerbirds may provide an example of rudimentary courtship coalitions. In particular, higher subordinate attendance is associated with lower destruction rates by neighbouring rivals and with overall higher mating success, and male pairs are stable in subsequent years. This study provides novel information about social dynamics among male bowerbirds, and further insights into the evolution of coalitionary behaviour in male displays.},

A model was constructed for the 1995–1996 water year and calibrated within ± 3 percent of the observed mean concentration of total phosphorus. It was found that runoff from urban areas contributed most to the loading of phosphorus to the stream. When the model was assessed by running it for the 1977–1978 water year, using water quality and land use data collected independently, agreement within ± 7 percent was obtained. The model was then used to forecast the impact of future urban development proposed for the watershed, in terms of phosphorus loading, and to evaluate the reduction in loading resulting from several urban best management practices (BMP). It was determined that phosphorus removal will have to be applied to all the urban runoff from the watershed to appreciably reduce stream phosphorus concentration. Of the BMP designs assessed, an infiltration pond system resulted in the greatest phosphorus load reduction, 50 percent from the 1995–1996 baseline.},

Written in the same engaging and lucid style as the previous editions, the authors explain the latest theoretical ideas using examples from micro-organisms, invertebrates and vertebrates. There are boxed sections for some topics and marginal notes help guide the reader. The book is essential reading for students of behavioural ecology, animal behaviour and evolutionary biology.  Key Features:  Long-awaited new edition of a field-defining textbook New chapters, illustrations and colour photographs New co-author Focuses on the influence of natural selection on behavior, and how animal societies reflect both cooperation and conflict among individuals  “The long-awaited update to a classic in this field is now here, presenting new direc­tions in thinking and addressing burning questions. Richly informed by progress in many other disciplines, such as sensory physiology, genetics and evolutionary theory, it marks the emergence of behav­ioural ecology as a fully fledged discipline….. This is a marvellous book, written in a lucid style. A must-read for those in the field, it is also a cornucopia of new thinking for anyone interested in evolution and behaviour.” Manfred Milinski, Nature, 2012},

	title = {Mate quality and mating decisions},
	abstract = {Apparent mate choice may be observed in the field even when there is no active choice (in the sense that there is discrimination between different potential mates). If females are passively attracted to a male advertisement cue, a mate's reproductive success will be an increasing function of the relative intensity of his cue. An ESS will consist of a state in which observed reproductive success depends on male phenotype because different phenotypes will have different optimar advertisenlent levels.
There may be difficulty in maintaining active mate choice if benefits of choice relate entirely to 'good genes' because of the costs of choice. whereas benefits (proportional to genetic variance) diminish towards zero with selection (depending on the extent of recurrent mutation), costs are unlikely ever to become negligible. Mate choice is therefore most likely to occur when benefits relate to environmentally-induced variation.
A mate choice model is proposed in which the two important variables are (i) the degree of variance in mate quality for each sex, and (ii) the costs of choice for each sex; equivalent to the costs of flnding an alternative mate. There are three ESSs: both sexes indiscriminate; one sex indiscriminate, one choosy; both sexes choosy to some degree. A prospective analysis suggests that if the ESS is for both sexes to show choice, one solution is that there will be assortative pairing for mate quality over a range of lower-quality individuals. Another solution is that one sex has choosy (high quality) individuals and less choosy (low quality) individuals, and the other sex has choosy (high quality) and indiscriminate (low quality) individuals.
There will commonly be conflict between the sexes over mating decisions (mate or not mate) in a given encounter. When males can achieve a mating by out-persisting a female (the sexual war of attrition), this conflict is likely to be resolved by difference in relative costs sustained during persistence. When males can more readily enforce matings on females (and females more readily resist) by increased investment in armament (the sexual arms race) the result is likely to be an equilibrium development of armament in each sex. In both models, one sex will usually win the conflict, depending on the characteristic asymmetries.
The greater the variance in mate quality of the opposite sex, the greater the relative benefits of mate choice. Because genetic variance may be small, the main contribution to variance in mate quality is likely to be environmental variance in ability to supply parental investment (PI). But as one sex increases its PI, it becomes more costly for individuals of the other sex to be choosy. Both costs and benefits ofchoice therefore increase with increasing PI of the opposite sex; this makes general predictions difficult. The intensity of selection for female choice may increase as male parental investment increases, in contrast to intermale competition. Assortative pairing for rn:de quaiity is perhaps most likely in a species with equal PI and low search costs. When males guard single females but contribute no PI, it may pay the male to be more choosy than the female.},

	abstract = {Males of many animals have more than a single exaggerated secondary sexual character, but inter-specific variability in the number of ornaments has never been explained. We examine three hypotheses that may account for the presence of multiple ornaments. First, the multiple message hypothesis proposes that each display reflects a single property of the overall quality of an animal. This is likely to be the case for ornaments that respond to condition on different time scales. Second, the redundant signal hypothesis suggests that each ornament gives a partial indication of condition. Females pay attention to several sex traits because in combination they provide a better estimate of general condition than does any single ornament. The redundant signal hypothesis predicts that (i) multiple ornaments should be particularly common among taxa with relatively uncostly and fine-tuned female choice, and (ii) females pay equal attention to the expression of all the secondary sex traits in order to obtain an estimate of overall male condition. Finally, the unreliable signal hypothesis argues that some ornaments are unreliable indicators of overall condition and are only maintained because they are relatively uncostly to produce and there is a weak female preference for them. This predicts that (i) multiple sexual ornaments should be particularly common in taxa with the most intense sexual selection (i.e. lekking and other polygynous taxa), and (ii) there should be more evidence for condition dependence in ornaments of species with single as opposed to multiple ornaments. Both the latter predictions are supported by data on feather ornaments in birds.},

Theory predicts that change in BEF relationships with increasing spatial scale will depend on variation in species composition across space (β-diversity), but empirical evidence for this is limited. Moreover, studies have not quantified the direct and indirect role the environment plays in costructuring ecosystem functioning across spatial scales. We used 14 temperate-forest plots 1.4 ha in size containing 18,323 trees to quantify scale-dependence between aboveground tree biomass and three components of tree-species diversity—α-diversity (average local diversity), γ-diversity (total diversity), and β-diversity. Using structural-equation models, we quantified the direct effects of each diversity component and the environment (soil nutrients and topography), as well as indirect effects of the environment, on tree biomass across 11 spatial extents ranging from 400 to 14,400 m2. Our results show that the relationship between β-diversity and tree biomass strengthened with increasing spatial extent. Moreover, β-diversity appeared to be a stronger predictor of biomass than α-diversity and γ-diversity at intermediate to large spatial extents. The environment had strong direct and indirect effects on biomass, but, in contrast to diversity, these effects did not strengthen with increasing spatial extent. This study provides some of the first empirical evidence that β-diversity underpins the scaling of BEF relationships in naturally complex ecosystems.},

Biodiversity–ecosystem functioning (BEF) research has provided compelling evidence for a positive effect of biodiversity on ecosystem functions and services at the local (α-diversity) scale, but we largely lack empirical evidence on how the loss of between-patch β-diversity affects biodiversity and multifunctionality at the landscape scale (γ-diversity). Here, we present a novel concept and experimental framework for elucidating BEF patterns at α-, β-, and γ-scales in real landscapes at a forest management-relevant scale. We examine this framework using 22 temperate broadleaf production forests, dominated by Fagus sylvatica. In 11 of these forests, we manipulated the structure between forest patches by increasing variation in canopy cover and deadwood. We hypothesized that an increase in landscape heterogeneity would enhance the β-diversity of different trophic levels, as well as the β-functionality of various ecosystem functions. We will develop a new statistical framework for BEF studies extending across scales and incorporating biodiversity measures from taxonomic to functional to phylogenetic diversity using Hill numbers. We will further expand the Hill number concept to multifunctionality allowing the decomposition of γ-multifunctionality into α- and β-components. Combining this analytic framework with our experimental data will allow us to test how an increase in between patch heterogeneity affects biodiversity and multifunctionality across spatial scales and trophic levels to help inform and improve forest resilience under climate change. Such an integrative concept for biodiversity and functionality, including spatial scales and multiple aspects of diversity and multifunctionality as well as physical and environmental structure in forests, will go far beyond the current widely applied approach in forestry to increase resilience of future forests through the manipulation of tree species composition.},

Over time, species richness (α) and landscape heterogeneity are prone to increase and lead to greater between-site diversity (β). However, post-fire salvage logging can reduce β-diversity, both directly and through its influence on succession. The as-yet understudied response of land snails to long-term habitat modification after wildfires and forest management is important for decision-making in forest restoration and conservation. We expected to detect differences in land snails and diversity in both the short and long term and between treatments in a natural park in the Mediterranean Basin. However, our results showed that post-fire management was a non-significant variable for snail community diversity, the exception being open-habitat endemic species. Plant succession and leaf litter cover were the main variables that shaped snail diversity and abundance over time after fires. Eighteen years after a fire, the land snail diversity had improved and the community composition had diversified, irrespective of the post-fire treatment, but threatened species disappeared and the total snail numbers had notably declined. To preserve threatened open-habitat species, prescribed fires and livestock grazing are recommended in combination with mature areas that can act as shelters where forest snails can recover from future disturbances.},

Geographic regions rich in surface waters are also prone to agricultural and urban development and so may become increasingly eutrophic as the population rises. Here we develop C budgets of highly eutrophic lakes. These analyses show that lakes undergoing eutrophication can become atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) sinks because of the CO2 disequilibrium caused by extreme primary production. C budgets of such lakes show they absorb both landscape and atmospheric C, converting it into lake sediments and passing additional dissolved organic C (DOC) downstream. Eutrophication may cause a reversal in the role played by oligotrophic lakes by promoting atmospheric C sequestration as sediment and DOC. This means that as eutrophication increases from agriculture and urbanization, the expected large CO2 evasion to the atmosphere by natural lakes will decline substantially and inland C sequestration and enrichment of DOC in waters flowing to the sea will be augmented. Thus, we suggest that the global C role of eutrophication is worthy of future consideration because it represents an interface between 2 large, converging environmental problems, whose interaction may reverse the role of lakes in the global C cycle.},

            Burial in sediments removes organic carbon (OC) from the short-term biosphere-atmosphere carbon (C) cycle, and therefore prevents greenhouse gas production in natural systems. Although OC burial in lakes and reservoirs is faster than in the ocean, the magnitude of inland water OC burial is not well constrained. Here we generate the first global-scale and regionally resolved estimate of modern OC burial in lakes and reservoirs, deriving from a comprehensive compilation of literature data. We coupled statistical models to inland water area inventories to estimate a yearly OC burial of 0.15 (range, 0.06–0.25) Pg C, of which {\textasciitilde}40\% is stored in reservoirs. Relatively higher OC burial rates are predicted for warm and dry regions. While we report lower burial than previously estimated, lake and reservoir OC burial corresponded to {\textasciitilde}20\% of their C emissions, making them an important C sink that is likely to increase with eutrophication and river damming.},

We used floating static gas chambers to assess diffusive fluxes of methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrous oxide (N2O) from the air–water interface of three beaver ponds (0.05–8 ha) in Rhode Island from fall 2012 to summer 2013. Gas flux was based on linear changes of gas concentrations in chambers over 1 h. Our results show that these beaver ponds generated considerable CH4 and CO2 emissions. Methane flux (18–556 mg m-2 d-1) showed no significant seasonal differences, but the shallowest pond generated significantly higher CH4 flux than the other ponds. Carbon dioxide flux (0.5–22.0 g m-2 d-1) was not significantly different between sites, but it was significantly higher in the fall, possibly due to the degradation of fresh leaves. Nitrous oxide flux was low (0–2.4 mg m-2 d-1). Overall, CH4 and CO2 comprised most of the global warming potential, 61 and 38\%, respectively. The shallowness of the beaver ponds may have limited the time needed for CH4 oxidation to CO2 before CH4 escaped to the atmosphere. Beaver dams also increase the aerial extent of hydric soils, which may transform riparian areas from upland GHG sinks to wetland GHG sources thereby changing the net global warming potential. Further studies tracking the pattern and conditions of beaver pond creation and abandonment will be essential to understanding their role as GHG sources.},

In this article, we provide an overview of the consequences of browning in relation to ecosystem services, outline what the underlying drivers and mechanisms of browning are, and speciﬁcally focus on exploring potential mitigation measures to locally counteract browning. These topical concepts are discussed with a focus on Scandinavia, but are of relevance also to other regions. Browning is of environmental concern as it leads to, e.g., increasing costs and risks for drinking water production, and reduced ﬁsh production in lakes by limiting light penetration. While climate change, recovery from acidiﬁcation, and land-use change are all likely factors contributing to the observed browning, managing the land use in the hydrologically connected parts of the landscape may be the most feasible way to counteract browning of natural waters.},

Using a 93 lake dataset of reliably dated sediment cores (OC burial of 9 to 318 g m–2 y–1), we demonstrate the applicability of this approach in a variety of lake types. We validate our estimated rates of OC burial against (1) measured whole-lake accumulation from the sum of multiple area-weighted sediment cores, (2) single central-basin cores adjusted for sediment focusing, and (3) duplicate sediment cores taken in multiple locations and at different times (4-10 years apart) in 9 lakes.

The applicability of this approach to other lakes and regions requires knowledge of (1) atmospheric 210Pb flux, (2) an estimate of supported 210Pb activity, and (3) some understanding of typical sedimentation rates in the study lakes. This approach provides an accurate assessment of OC burial, with increased potential for greater spatial coverage in inland waters and improved ability to address questions focused on terrestrial–aquatic exchanges of organic carbon.},

Due to known limitations of ﬁre datasets, an analysis of changes in ﬁre-regime characteristics could not be easily undertaken. This paper presents ﬁre-regime trends nationally and within two zonation systems, the homogeneous ﬁre-regime zones and ecozones, for two time periods, 1959–2015 and 1980–2015. Nationally, trends in both area burned and number of large ﬁres (≥200 ha) have increased signiﬁcantly since 1959, which might be due to increases in lightning-caused ﬁres. Human-caused ﬁres, in contrast, have shown a decline. Results suggest that large ﬁres have been getting larger over the last 57 years and that the ﬁre season has been starting approximately one week earlier and ending one week later. At the regional level, trends in ﬁre regimes are variable across the country, with fewer signiﬁcant trends. Area burned, number of large ﬁres, and lightning-caused ﬁres are increasing in most of western Canada, whereas human-caused ﬁres are either stable or declining throughout the country. Overall, Canadian forests appear to have been engaged in a trajectory towards more active ﬁre regimes over the last half century.},

We show that streams and rivers in the US are supersaturated with carbon dioxide when compared with the atmosphere, emitting 97+/-32Tg carbon each year. We further show that regionally, carbon dioxide evasion from streams and rivers is positively correlated with annual precipitation, which we attribute to climatic regulation of stream surface area, and the flushing of carbon dioxide from soils. Scaling our analysis from the US to temperate rivers between 25°N and 50°N, we estimate a release of around 0.5Pg carbon to

We found burial rates increased significantly over the last century and are up to five times greater than previous estimates. Despite a correlation with temperature, warming alone did not explain the increase in burial, suggesting the importance of other drivers including atmospherically deposited reactive nitrogen. Upscaling mean lake burial rates for each time period to global northern forests yields up to 4.5 Pg C accumulated in the last 100 years—20\% of the total burial over the Holocene.

	abstract = {The widespread browning of northern lakes has been associated with long-term increases in dissolved organic carbon and color and should be linked to changes in surface water carbon dioxide, yet the long-term covariation in these three key carbon components of lake functioning remains to be assessed. We present long-term trends in dissolved organic carbon, color, and carbon dioxide from lakes, with generally positive but highly variable trends in organic carbon and a large degree of uncoupling with color and carbon dioxide. The highest rates of change in color and carbon dioxide were in lakes with greatest increasing dissolved organic carbon trends. Lakes with the lowest water retention times had greater increases and stronger coupling between all three parameters, coinciding with dominance of terrestrially derived carbon. These results suggest an uneven terrestrialization of northern lakes, where the increases and coupling in the three carbon components depends on hydrology and watershed connectivity.},

	abstract = {The concentrations of terrestrially derived dissolved organic carbon have been increasing throughout northern aquatic ecosystems in recent decades, but whether these shifts have an impact on aquatic carbon emissions at the continental scale depends on the potential for this terrestrial carbon to be converted into carbon dioxide. Here, via the analysis of hundreds of boreal lakes, rivers and wetlands in Canada, we show that, contrary to conventional assumptions, the proportion of biologically degradable dissolved organic carbon remains constant and the photochemical degradability increases with terrestrial influence. Thus, degradation potential increases with increasing amounts of terrestrial carbon. Our results provide empirical evidence of a strong causal link between dissolved organic carbon concentrations and aquatic fluxes of carbon dioxide, mediated by the degradation of land-derived organic carbon in aquatic ecosystems. Future shifts in the patterns of terrestrial dissolved organic carbon in inland waters thus have the potential to significantly increase aquatic carbon emissions across northern landscapes.},

Yet, despite the potential implications of shifting phenology for plant carbon uptake, the degree to which phenological changes affect overall plant growth and the partitioning between above- and below-ground biomass remains unclear. Here we use a 3-year experiment to quantify changes in root and shoot growth of three woody plant species (two common European tree species, Fagus sylvatica and Quercus robur, and one shrub Lonicera xylosteum) under spring and autumn warming. In both tree species, the magnitude—and in Quercus even the direction—of the effects of growing-season length on growth depends on whether the warming happened in spring or in autumn. Each day earlier leaf-out in response to warming resulted in total biomass increases of 0.8\%–2.5\%, whereas delayed senescence led to reductions of 0.2\%–2.1\%. Advances in leaf-out also led to increased root-to-shoot biomass ratios because root growth was proportionally more stimulated than shoot growth. In the shrub species, earlier leaf-out had no effect, while delayed senescence led to increases in root, but not shoot, biomass. Synthesis. The strong asymmetry between growth responses to spring versus autumn phenology demonstrates that growing-season length per se is a weak indicator of individual-level tree productivity.

	title = {Exponential nutrient loading: a new fertilization technique to improve seedling performance on competitive sites},
	abstract = {Reforestation efforts in Ontario have become increasingly more reliant on containerized planting stock since these seedlings are less costly to produce and plant than bare-root stock. Container seedlings, however, tend to be more susceptible to competing vegetation when planted on weed-prone sites often requiring release by chemical herbicides. We have developed cultural techniques to improve the competitiveness of containerized seedlings by promoting initial outplanting performance thus reducing the need for early vegetation control. The approach is based on two new preconditioning practices, exponential fertilization and nutrient loading, which induce a steady-state build up of nutrient reserves in seedlings for outplanting. Exponential nutrient loading integrates these practices with high dose fertilization inducing luxury consumption. Steady-state culture corresponds better with the competitive outplanting environment, since stable internal nutrient accumulation in the greenhouse phase conforms with steady-state nutrient uptake of natural exponentially growing vegetation in the ﬁeld, and exponential nutrient delivery to container-restricted root systems also better simulates nutrient ﬂux reached by expanding roots in a ﬁeld soil with constant nutrient availability. Combined with nutrient loading, the higher nutrient reserves and improved nutrient balance in seedlings contribute to enhanced stress resistance and increased growth performance. This paper reviews the theory and practice of exponential nutrient loading during seedling culture, presents results of growth and nutritional responses of seedlings planted on competitive sites, and suggests appropriate criteria for quality testing of nutrient loaded stock.},

Half of the amount of nutrients was premixed into the peat medium and the other half was applied as liquid (5fertigated) in the treatment (PF) commonly used in Finland. In two other treatments all nutrients, either totally (P-VN) or partly (P-N) in slow-release form, were premixed into the peat. Independently of the treatment, the largest proportion (60 to 80\%) of total N leached during May and June. During two growing seasons, the amounts of N leached from PF treatments (9 to 36 kg ha21) were as large as the amounts of N leached from P-VN and P-N treatments (24 to 46 kg ha21). Due to fertigations between container trays, however, the total N load per hectare was greatest in the PF treatments. In the soil water 0.5 meter beneath the container area, the N concentration varied from 10 to 60 mg l21. The morphological and chemical properties of the seedlings did not differ greatly between treatments.},

Our paper aims to bring together the minimum knowledge necessary for a plant biologist to set up such experiments and apply the environmental conditions that are appropriate to answer the questions of interest. We ﬁrst focus on the basic choices that have to be made with regard to the experimental setup (e.g. where are the plants grown; what rooting medium; what pot size). Second, we present practical considerations concerning the number of plants that have to be analysed considering the variability in plant material and the required precision. Third, we discuss eight of the most important environmental factors for plant growth (light quantity, light quality, CO2, nutrients, air humidity, water, temperature and salinity); what critical issues should be taken into account to ensure proper growth conditions in controlled environments and which speciﬁc aspects need attention if plants are challenged with a certain a-biotic stress factor. Finally, we propose a simple checklist that could be used for tracking and reporting experimental conditions.},

	abstract = {Leaf phenology is one of the most reliable bioindicators of ongoing global warming in temperate and boreal zones because it is highly sensitive to temperature variation. A large number of studies have reported advanced spring leaf‐out due to global warming, yet the temperature sensitivity of leaf‐out has significantly decreased in temperate deciduous tree species over the past three decades. One of the possible mechanisms is that photoperiod is limiting further advance to protect the leaves against potential damaging frosts. However, the “photoperiod limitation” hypothesis remains poorly investigated and experimentally tested. Here, we conducted a photoperiod‐ and temperature‐manipulation experiment in climate chambers on two common deciduous species in Europe: Fagus sylvatica (European beech, a typically late flushing species) and Aesculus hippocastanum (horse chestnut, a typically early flushing species). In agreement with previous studies, we found that the warming significantly advanced the leaf‐out dates by 4.3 and 3.7 days/°C for beech and horse chestnut saplings, respectively. However, shorter photoperiod significantly reduced the temperature sensitivity of beech only (3.0 days/°C) by substantially increasing the heat requirement to avoid leafing‐out too early. Interestingly, the photoperiod limitation only occurs below a certain daylength (photoperiod threshold) when the warming increased above 4°C for beech trees. In contrast, for chestnut, no photoperiod threshold was found even when the ambient air temperature was warmed by 5°C. Given the species‐specific photoperiod effect on leaf phenology, the sequence of the leaf‐out timing among forest tree species may change under future climate warming conditions. Nonphotoperiodic species may benefit from warmer springs by starting the growing season earlier than photoperiodic sensitive species, modifying forest ecosystem structure and functions, but this photoperiod limitation needs to be further investigated experimentally in numerous species.},

	abstract = {In temperate trees, the timings of plant growth onset and cessation affect biogeochemical cycles, water, and energy balance. Currently, phenological studies largely focus on specific phenophases and on their responses to warming. How differently spring phenology responds to the warming and cooling, and affects the subsequent phases, has not been yet investigated in trees. Here, we exposed saplings of Fagus sylvatica L. to warmer and cooler climate during the winter 2013–2014 by conducting a reciprocal transplant experiment between two elevations (1,340 vs. 371 m a.s.l., ca. 6°C difference) in the Swiss Jura mountains. To test the legacy effects of earlier or later budburst on the budset timing, saplings were moved back to their original elevation shortly after the occurrence of budburst in spring 2014. One degree decrease in air temperature in winter/spring resulted in a delay of 10.9 days in budburst dates, whereas one degree of warming advanced the date by 8.8 days. Interestingly, we also found an asymmetric effect of the warmer winter vs. cooler winter on the budset timing in late summer. Budset of saplings that experienced a cooler winter was delayed by 31 days compared to the control, whereas it was delayed by only 10 days in saplings that experienced a warmer winter. Budburst timing in 2015 was not significantly impacted by the artificial advance or delay of the budburst timing in 2014, indicating that the legacy effects of the different phenophases might be reset during each winter. Adapting phenological models to the whole annual phenological cycle, and considering the different response to cooling and warming, would improve predictions of tree phenology under future climate warming conditions.},

Previous studies have largely focused on the climate impact on spring phenology, and to date the processes underlying leaf senescence and their associated environmental drivers remain poorly understood. In this study, experiments with temperature gradients imposed during the summer and autumn were conducted on saplings of European beech to explore the temperature responses of leaf senescence. An additional warming experiment during winter enabled us to assess the differences in temperature responses of spring leaf‐out and autumn leaf senescence. We found that warming significantly delayed the dates of leaf senescence both during summer and autumn warming, with similar temperature sensitivities (6–8 days delay per °C warming), suggesting that, in the absence of water and nutrient limitation, temperature may be a dominant factor controlling the leaf senescence in European beech. Interestingly, we found a significantly larger temperature response of autumn leaf senescence than of spring leaf‐out. This suggests a possible larger contribution of delays in autumn senescence, than of the advancement in spring leaf‐out, to extending the growing season under future warmer conditions.},

	abstract = {Climate warming is currently advancing spring leaf‐out of temperate and boreal trees, enhancing net primary productivity (NPP) of forests. However, it remains unclear whether this trend will continue, preventing for accurate projections of ecosystem functioning and climate feedbacks. Several ecophysiological mechanisms have been proposed to regulate the timing of leaf emergence in response to changing environmental cues, but the relative importance of those mechanisms remains unclear. Here, we use 727,401 direct phenological observations of common European forest trees to examine the dominant controls on leaf‐out. Using the emerging mechanisms, we forecast future trajectories of spring arrival and evaluate the consequences for forest carbon dynamics. By representing hypothesized relationships with autumn temperature, winter chilling, and the timing of spring onset, we accurately predicted reductions in the advance of leaf‐out. There was a strong consensus between our empirical model and existing process‐based models, revealing that the advance in leaf‐out will not exceed 2 weeks over the rest of the century. We further estimate that, under a ‘business‐as‐usual’ climate scenario, earlier spring arrival will enhance NPP of temperate and boreal forests by 0.2 Gt per year at the end of the century. In contrast, previous estimates based on a simple degree‐day model range around 0.8 Gt. As such, the expected NPP is drastically reduced in our updated model relative to previous estimates—by a total of 25 Gt over the rest of the century. These findings reveal important environmental constraints on the productivity of broad‐leaved deciduous trees and highlight that shifting spring phenology is unlikely to slow the rate of warming by offsetting anthropogenic carbon emissions.},

	abstract = {Autumn senescence regulates multiple aspects of ecosystem function, along with associated feedbacks to the climate system. Despite its importance, current understanding of the drivers of senescence is limited, leading to a large spread in predictions of how the timing of senescence, and thus the length of the growing season, will change under future climate conditions. The most commonly held paradigm is that temperature and photoperiod are the primary controls, which suggests a future extension of the autumnal growing season as global temperatures rise. Here, using two decades of ground‐ and satellite‐based observations of temperate deciduous forest phenology, we show that the timing of autumn senescence is correlated with the timing of spring budburst across the entire eastern United States. On a year‐to‐year basis, an earlier/later spring was associated with an earlier/later autumn senescence, both for individual species and at a regional scale. We use the observed relationship to develop a novel model of autumn phenology. In contrast to current phenology models, this model predicts that the potential response of autumn phenology to future climate change is strongly limited by the impact of climate change on spring phenology. Current models of autumn phenology therefore may overpredict future increases in the length of the growing season, with subsequent impacts for modeling future CO2 uptake and evapotranspiration.},

	abstract = {The growing-season length of temperate and boreal trees has a strong effect on the global carbon cycle. Yet, a poor understanding of the drivers of phenological processes, such as autumn leaf senescence in deciduous trees, limits our capacity to estimate growing-season lengths under climate change. While temperature has been shown to be an important driver of autumn leaf senescence, carbon source–sink dynamics have been proposed as a mechanism that could help explain variation of this important process. According to the carbon sink limitation hypothesis, senescence is regulated by the interplay between plant carbon source and sink dynamics, so that senescence occurs later upon low carbon inputs (source) and earlier upon low carbon demand (sink). Here, we manipulated carbon source–sink dynamics in birch saplings (Betula pendula) to test the relevance of carbon sink limitation for autumn leaf senescence and photosynthetic decline in a widespread deciduous tree. Specifically, we conducted a gradient of leaf and bud removal treatments and monitored the effects on autumnal declines in net photosynthesis and the timing of leaf senescence. In line with the carbon sink limitation hypothesis, we observed that leaf removal tended to increase total leaf-level autumn photosynthesis and delayed the timing of senescence. Conversely, we did not observe an effect of bud removal on either photosynthesis or senescence, which was likely caused by the fact that our bud removal treatment did not considerably affect the plant carbon sink. While we cannot fully rule out that the observed effect of leaf removal was influenced by possible treatment-level differences in leaf age or soil resource availability, our results provide support for the hypothesis of carbon sink limitation as a driver of growing-season length and move the scientific field closer to narrowing the uncertainty in climate change predictions.},

Previous studies focused solely on the advanced stages of autumnal leaf senescence and claimed that climatic warming delays senescence, despite the fundamental differences among the stages of senescence. However, the timing of onset of leaf coloration (DLCO), the earliest visual sign of senescence, has been rarely studied. Our aim is to assess the response of DLCO to temperature across the Northern Hemisphere.Location: 30–75°N in the Northern Hemisphere.Time period: 2000–2018.Major taxa studied: Deciduous vegetation.Methods: We retrieved DLCO from high temporal-resolution satellite data, which was then validated by PhenoCam observations. We then investigated the temporal changes in DLCO and the relationship between DLCO and temperature by using DLCO from satellite data and ground phenological observations. We further estimated the timing of onset of autumnal decline in maximum canopy photosynthetic capacity, an indicator of leaf senescence earlier than DLCO, from FLUXNET CO2 fluxes data, and assessed its response to temperature.Results: DLCO was not significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) delayed between 2000 and 2018 in 94\% of the area. DLCO was positively correlated with pre-DLCO mean daily minimum temperature (Tmin) in only 9\% of the area, likely because of the overriding photoperiodic control, particularly for woody vegetation, whereas the end of leaf coloration (DLCE) was positively correlated with pre-DLCE mean Tmin over a larger area (34\%).Main conclusions: The coloration progress rate is more sensitive than its start date to temperature, indicating an extension of the duration of leaf senescence under warming. This study indicates that the leaf coloration onset was not responsive to climate warming and provides observational evidence of photoperiod control of autumnal leaf senescence at biome and continental scales.},

Here we experimentally studied spring and autumn phenology in four temperate trees in response to changes in bud albedo (white‐painted vs black‐painted buds), light conditions (nonshaded vs c. 70\% shaded), water availability (irrigated, control and reduced precipitation) and nutrients (low vs high availability). We found that higher bud albedo or shade delayed budburst (up to +12 d), indicating that temperature is sensed locally within each bud. Leaf senescence was delayed by high nutrient availability (up to +7 d) and shade conditions (up to +39 d) in all species, except oak. Autumn phenological responses to summer droughts depended on species, with a delay for cherry (+7 d) and an advance for beech (−7 d). The strong phenological effects of bud albedo and light exposure reveal an important role of microclimatic variation on phenology. In addition to the temperature and photoperiod effects, our results suggest a tight interplay between source and sink processes in regulating the end of the seasonal vegetation cycle, which can be largely influenced by resource availability (light, water and nutrients).},

	abstract = {Spring phenology of temperate forest trees has advanced substantially over the last decades due to climate warming, but this advancement is slowing down despite continuous temperature rise. The decline in spring advancement is often attributed to winter warming, which could reduce chilling and thus delay dormancy release. However, mechanistic evidence of a phenological response to warmer winter temperatures is missing. We aimed to understand the contrasting effects of warming on plants leaf phenology and to disentangle temperature effects during different seasons. With a series of monthly experimental warming by ca. 2.4°C from late summer until spring, we quantified phenological responses of forest tree to warming for each month separately, using seedlings of four common European tree species. To reveal the underlying mechanism, we tracked the development of dormancy depth under ambient conditions as well as directly after each experimental warming. In addition, we quantified the temperature response of leaf senescence. As expected, warmer spring temperatures led to earlier leaf‐out. The advancing effect of warming started already in January and increased towards the time of flushing, reaching 2.5 days/°C. Most interestingly, however, warming in October had the opposite effect and delayed spring phenology by 2.4 days/°C on average; despite six months between the warming and the flushing. The switch between the delaying and advancing effect occurred already in December. We conclude that not warmer winters but rather the shortening of winter, i.e., warming in autumn, is a major reason for the decline in spring phenology.},

However, the underlying mechanisms of autumn phenology responses to climate change have not been fully elucidated. The aims of this study were to determine whether brightening that was defined as the increase of surface solar radiation and warming during recent decades affect autumn phenology in opposite directions and explore the underlying mechanisms. Location: Central Europe. Time period: 1950–2016. Major taxa studied: Four dominant European tree species in central Europe: Aesculus hippocastanum, Betula pendula, Fagus sylvatica and Quercus robur. Methods: We investigated the temporal trends of leaf senescence, preseason temperature and radiation by separating the period of 1950–2016 into two sub-periods (1950–1982 and 1983–2016) and determined the relationship between temperature, radiation and leaf senescence using partial correlation analysis. Results: We found a significant warming and brightening trend after the 1980s in central Europe, yet this led to only slight delays in leaf senescence that cannot be explained by the well-known positive correlation between leaf senescence and autumn warming. Interestingly, we found opposite effects between warming (partial correlation coefficient, r =.37) and brightening (r = −.23) on leaf senescence. In addition, the temperature sensitivity of leaf senescence decreased with increasing radiation (−5.08 days/℃/108 J/m2). Main conclusions: The results suggested that brightening accelerated the leaf senescence dates, counteracting the warming-induced delays in leaf senescence, which may be attributed to photooxidative stress and/or sink limitation. This emphasizes the need to consider radiation to improve the performance of autumn phenology models. (Less)},

	abstract = {Leaf-out phenology plays a key role in ecosystem structure and functioning. Phenological changes have often been linked to climatic factors and have received considerable attention, with most studies focusing on trends of leaf-out phenology. Leaf-out variation (LOV), which reflects the stability of phenological responses, may also be affected by climate change, yet this has received less scientific attention. In this study, we examined spring LOV in response to climate change in China during the period 1963–2008 using in situ records of 15 species at 25 phenological observation sites across several climate zones and explored spatiotemporal changes of LOV and the underlying mechanisms. We observed a significant decrease of LOV toward higher latitudes (−0.2 ± 0.1 days⋅°N–1; P {\textless} 0.001) across all species. Temporally, we found that the LOV was significantly increased from the period 1963–1986 (6.9 ± 2.8 days) to the period 1987–2008 (7.9 ± 3.7 days, P {\textless} 0.05). Furthermore, the LOV changes between 1987–2008 and 1963–1986 were significantly smaller at high latitudes (average decrease of 1.0 day) than at low latitudes (average increase of 1.5 days). The spatial pattern of LOV is likely due to both increased heat requirements and greater temperature sensitivity at low latitudes compared with high latitudes. The temporal pattern of LOV is likely related to increased heat requirements for leaf-out during 1987–2008 when the average air temperature was higher. Our analysis indicated that the phenology response to climate change is reflected not only in the temporal trends for long time series but also in the variation of phenological dates. Results from this study improve our understanding of phenological responses to climate change and could be applied in the assessment of regional phenology changes to evaluate better the impacts of climate change on ecosystem structure and function.},

Refoliation took 48, 43, and 36 d for beech, oak and honeysuckle, respectively.

These results reveal an unexpected ability of second-cohort leaves of beech and oak to compensate for spring frost damage, and demonstrate that long-lived trees vary their autumnal phenology depending on preceding productivity.},

Using one million records of leaf phenology from four dominant temperate species in Europe, we investigated the temperature sensitivities of spring leaf unfolding and autumn leaf senescence (ST, advanced or delayed days per degree Celsius). The ST of spring phenology in all of the four examined species showed an increase and decrease during 1951–1980 and 1981–2013, respectively. The decrease in the ST during 1981–2013 appears to be caused by reduced accumulation of chilling units. As with spring phenology, the ST of leaf senescence of early successional and exotic species started to decline since 1980. In contrast, for late successional species, the ST of autumn senescence showed an increase for the entire study period from 1951 to 2013. Moreover, the impacts of rising temperature associated with global warming on spring leaf unfolding were stronger than those on autumn leaf senescence. The timing of leaf senescence was positively correlated with the timing of leaf unfolding during 1951–1980. However, as climate warming continued, the differences in the responses between spring and autumn phenology gradually increased, so that the correlation was no more significant during 1981–2013. Our results further suggest that since 2000, due to the decreased temperature sensitivity of leaf unfolding the length of the growing season has not increased any more. These finding needs to be addressed in vegetation models used for assessing the effects of climate change.},

As a result, the interspecific differences in spring phenology (IDSP) are expected to change with climate warming, which may, in turn, induce negative or positive ecological consequences. However, the temporal change of IDSP at large spatiotemporal scales remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed long‐term in‐situ observations (1951–2016) of six, coexisting temperate tree species from 305 sites across Central Europe and found that phenological ranking did not change when comparing the rapidly warming period 1984–2016 to the marginally warming period 1951–1983. However, the advance of leaf flushing was significantly larger in early‐flushing species EFS (6.7 ± 0.3 days) than in late‐flushing species LFS (5.9 ± 0.2 days) between the two periods, indicating extended IDSP. This IDSP extension could not be explained by differences in temperature sensitivity between EFS and LFS; however, climatic warming‐induced heat accumulation effects on leaf flushing, which were linked to a greater heat requirement and higher photoperiod sensitivity in LFS, drove the shifts in IDSP. Continued climate warming is expected to further extend IDSP across temperate trees, with associated implications for ecosystem function.},

Predicting leaf senescence dates (LSD) with high accuracy is thus a prerequisite for better understanding the climate–ecosystem interactions. However, modeling LSD at large spatial and temporal scales is challenging. In this study, first, we used 19972 site‐year records (848 sites and four deciduous tree species) from the PAN European Phenology network to calibrate and evaluate six leaf senescence models during the period 1980–2013. Second, we extended the spatial analysis by repeating the procedure across Europe using satellite‐derived end of growing season and a forest map. Overall, we found that models that considered photoperiod and temperature interactions outperformed models using simple temperature or photoperiod thresholds for Betula pendula, Fagus sylvatica and Quercus robur. On the contrary, no model displayed reasonable predictions for Aesculus hippocastanum. This inter‐model comparison indicates that, contrary to expectation, photoperiod does not significantly modulate the accumulation of cooling degree days (CDD). On the other hand, considering the carryover effect of leaf unfolding date could promote the models’ predictability. The CDD models generally matched the observed LSD at species level and its interannual variation, but were limited in explaining the inter‐site variations, indicating that other environmental cues need to be considered in future model development. The discrepancies remaining between model simulations and observations highlight the need of manipulation studies to elucidate the mechanisms behind the leaf senescence process and to make current models more realistic.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Our understanding of the natural variability of hydroclimate before the instrumental period (ca. 1900 CE in the United States) is largely dependent on tree-ring-based reconstructions. Large-scale soil moisture reconstructions from a network of tree-ring chronologies have greatly improved our understanding of the spatial and temporal variability in hydroclimate conditions, particularly extremes of both drought and pluvial (wet) events. However, certain regions within these large-scale network reconstructions in the US are modeled by few tree-ring chronologies. Further, many of the chronologies currently publicly available on the International Tree-Ring Data Bank (ITRDB) were collected in the 1980s and 1990s, and thus our understanding of the sensitivity of radial growth to soil moisture in the US is based on a period that experienced multiple extremely severe droughts and neglects the impacts of recent, rapid global change. In this study, we expanded the tree-ring network of the Ohio River valley in the US, a region with sparse coverage. We used a total of 72 chronologies across 15 species to examine how increasing the density of the tree-ring network influences the representation of reconstructing the Palmer Meteorological Drought Index (PMDI). Further, we tested how the sampling date and therefore the calibration period influenced the reconstruction models by creating reconstructions that ended in the year 1980 and compared them to reconstructions ending in 2010 from the same chronologies. We found that increasing the density of the tree-ring network resulted in reconstructed values that better matched the spatial variability of instrumentally recorded droughts and, to a lesser extent, pluvials. By extending the calibration period to 2010 compared to 1980, the sensitivity of tree rings to PMDI decreased in the southern portion of our region where severe drought conditions have been absent over recent decades. We emphasize the need of building a high-density tree-ring network to better represent the spatial variability of past droughts and pluvials. Further, chronologies on the ITRDB need updating regularly to better understand how the sensitivity of tree rings to climate may vary through time.},

	abstract = {Leaf senescence (LS) affects tree fitness, species distribution and ecosystem structure and functioning. The drivers of LS and the processes underlying it have been studied, but the studies have mainly focused on environmental cues and have mainly been based on statistical analyses using in situ data sets. Experimental investigation and field verification of the processes and drivers are thus urgently needed. We conducted a nutrient-addition experiment after a spring-warming experiment in which an 40-day range of leaf-out (LO) dates was induced in horse chestnut and beech saplings. We found that both increased nutrient supply and advanced LO date significantly affected the timing of LS, but their effects were opposite, as the former delayed and the latter advanced the senescence. The effects of nutrient supply and LO interacted species specifically. In chestnut, the delay of senescence caused by fertilization increased with the delay of LO and was thus stronger for individuals that flushed late in the spring. On the contrary, in beech the delay of senescence caused by fertilization decreased with the delay of LO and was insignificant for individuals with the latest LO. The experimental findings for beech were confirmed with mature trees at a regional scale. The interactive effect between nutrients and LO on senescence may be associated with variable sensitivity to photoperiod, growth sink limitation and/or direct effect of foliar nutrition on the timing of senescence. Our novel results show that the interactive effects of LO and nutrient supply on the timing of LS should be further addressed experimentally in forthcoming studies. It would also be interesting to consider our results in the further development of phenological models used in assessing effects of climatic change. The differences found in the present study between horse chestnut and beech suggest that the results found for one species cannot necessarily be generalized to other species, so studies with different temperate tree species are called for.},

	abstract = {Plant phenology is highly sensitive to climate change, and shifts in autumnal foliar senescence are critical for plant productivity and nutrient cycling. Global warming has delayed the timing of foliar senescence, but the response of autumnal foliar senescence to nonuniform seasonal warming remains poorly understood, with experimental evidence in trees especially scarce. We therefore conducted a field experiment on seasonally asymmetric warming on 2‐year‐old larch (Larix principis‐rupprechtii) seedlings in two hydrologically contrasting years (wet 2018 and dry 2019). Autumnal and year‐round warming significantly delayed the timing of foliar senescence by 6 and 7 d in 2018, the wet year, with corresponding temperature sensitivities of 6.73 ± 1.47 and 8.26 ± 1.00 d/°C, respectively. Interestingly, the dates of senescence did not change across the warming treatments in 2019, the dry year. However, there was no significant effect of summer warming on the timing of foliar senescence neither in the wet nor dry year. The delayed autumnal foliar senescence was responsible for an increase in biomass only in the wet year, 2018. In contrast, summer warming, but not autumnal warming, increased the mortality of the seedlings in both 2018 and 2019. These results suggest that the hydrological conditions substantially modify the response of autumnal phenology and growth to seasonal warming. Autumnal warming increases growth, whereas summer warming could cause carbon starvation/hydraulic failure, reduce growth, and lead to higher mortality. Our results suggest that the functioning, ecosystem services, and sustainability of forests in the future depend on the strength and pattern of nonuniform seasonal warming. This study can inspire new research in phenology and tree growth in experiments with asymmetric warming.},

How the timing of autumn leaf senescence in extra-tropical forests will change remains unclear because of the complex seasonal interaction of climate warming, earlier and enhanced vegetation activity, and the annual day-length cycle7–10. Here we use experiments, long-term ground observations, and satellite-based vegetation monitoring to show that early-season and late-season warming have opposite effects on the onset and progression of leaf senescence, with a reversal occurring at the year’s longest day (summer solstice). Across 84\% of the northern forest area, increased temperature and vegetation activity before the solstice led to an earlier senescence onset (10\% greenness loss) of, on average, –1.6 ± 0.1 days-per-°C, while warmer post-solstice temperatures did not affect senescence onset but reduced its speed (progression to 50\% greenness loss) by 0.8 ± 0.1 days-per-°C. Due to the earlier senescence onset, the day at which autumn temperature starts driving senescence progression has been shifting to ever earlier dates, between 1951—2015 at a rate of –0.20 ± 0.07 days per year. These developmental constraints suggest that senescence will start earlier but progress more slowly in the future, revealing Northern Hemisphere-wide compensation effects on trends in growing-season length, caused by enhanced pre-solstice vegetation activity. This new mechanistic insight improves our ability to model carbon uptake by extra-tropical forests under climate change.},

Experiments were performed in a common garden, with Belgian and Pyrenean provenances for Corylus avellana and Cornus sanguinea. In the Corylus taxa, a warmer spring resulted in a reduction in height and diameter growth. Remarkably, the reduced diameter increment was restored with full compensation in the following year. The height increment for Cornus sanguinea was larger upon a warmer summer–autumn, concurring with a later leaf senescence. Our results suggest that Corylus is more sensitive to spring warming, influencing growth negatively, whereas Cornus is more sensitive to summer–autumn warming, influencing height growth positively. These deviating responses can be explained, at least partly, by their diverging ecological niches, with the Corylus taxa being more shade-tolerant compared to Cornus sanguinea. The warm spring conditions advanced bud burst in all studied taxa, whereas the warm summer–autumn advanced leaf senescence but prolonged its duration in the Corylus taxa, as well as delayed this phenophase in Cornus sanguinea. Little to no after-effects of the temperature treatments were detected. Although Corylus avellana and Cornus sanguinea plants originated from similar origins, their growth and phenological responses in the common garden diverged, with Corylus being more stable and Cornus displaying more variation between the Belgian and Pyrenean provenances.},

Climatic warming has substantially advanced leaf‐out dates in temperate biomes worldwide, but its effect on the beginning and length of the TRP has not yet been explored, despite its direct relevance for phenology modeling. Using 1,551 species–site combinations of long‐term (1951–2016) in situ observations on six tree species (namely, Aesculus hippocastanum, Alnus glutinosa, Betula pendula, Fagus sylvatica, Fraxinus excelsior, and Quercus robur) in central Europe, we found that the advancing leaf‐out was accompanied by a shortening of the TRP. On average across all species and sites, the length of the TRP significantly decreased by 23\% (p {\textless} .05), from 60 ± 4 days during 1951–1965 to 47 ± 4 days during 2002–2016. Importantly, the average start date of the TRP did not vary significantly over the study period (March 2–5, DOY = 61–64), which could be explained by sufficient chilling over the study period in the regions considered. The advanced leaf‐out date with unchanged beginning of the TRP can be explained by the faster accumulation of the required heat due to climatic warming, which overcompensated for the retarding effect of shortening daylength on bud development. This study shows that climate warming has not yet affected the mean TRP starting date in the study region, implying that phenology modules in global land surface models might be reliable assuming a fixed TRP starting date at least for the temperate central Europe. Field warming experiments do, however, remain necessary to test to what extent the length of TRP will continue to shorten and whether the starting date will remain stable under future climate conditions.},

	abstract = {Abstract Climate models project warmer summer temperatures will increase the frequency and heat severity of droughts in temperate forests of Eastern North America. Hotter droughts are increasingly documented to affect tree growth and forest dynamics, with critical impacts on tree mortality, carbon sequestration and timber provision. The growing acknowledgement of the dominant role of drought timing on tree vulnerability to water deficit raises the issue of our limited understanding of radial growth phenology for most temperate tree species. Here, we use well-replicated dendrometer band data sampled frequently during the growing season to assess the growth phenology of 610 trees from 15 temperate species over 6 years. Patterns of diameter growth follow a typical logistic shape, with growth rates reaching a maximum in June, and then decreasing until process termination. On average, we find that diffuse-porous species take 16–18 days less than other wood-structure types to put on 50\% of their annual diameter growth. However, their peak growth rate occurs almost a full month later than ring-porous and conifer species (ca. 24 ± 4 days; mean ± 95\% credible interval). Unlike other species, the growth phenology of diffuse-porous species in our dataset is highly correlated with their spring foliar phenology. We also find that the later window of growth in diffuse-porous species, coinciding with peak evapotranspiration and lower water availability, exposes them to a higher water deficit of 88 ± 19 mm (mean ± SE) during their peak growth than ring-porous and coniferous species (15 ± 35 mm and 30 ± 30 mm, respectively). Given the high climatic sensitivity of wood formation, our findings highlight the importance of wood porosity as one predictor of species climatic sensitivity to the projected intensification of the drought regime in the coming decades.},

	abstract = {Limits to the growing season The length of the growing season in temperate forests has been increasing under recent climate change because of earlier leaf emergence and later leaf senescence. However, Zani et al. show that this trend might be reversed as increasing photosynthetic productivity begins to drive earlier autumn leaf senescence (see the Perspective by Rollinson). Using a combination of experimental, observational, and modeling studies based on European forest trees, the researchers conclude that leaf senescence will advance by 3 to 6 days by the end of the 21st century rather than lengthening by 1 to 3 weeks as current phenological models have predicted. In turn, this predicted phenological pattern will limit the capacity of temperate forests to mitigate climate change through carbon uptake. Science, this issue p. 1066; see also p. 1030 Physiological constraints on the growing season and productivity may limit the capacity of temperate forests to retain carbon. Changes in the growing-season lengths of temperate trees greatly affect biotic interactions and global carbon balance. Yet future growing-season trajectories remain highly uncertain because the environmental drivers of autumn leaf senescence are poorly understood. Using experiments and long-term observations, we show that increases in spring and summer productivity due to elevated carbon dioxide, temperature, or light levels drive earlier senescence. Accounting for this effect improved the accuracy of senescence predictions by 27 to 42\% and reversed future predictions from a previously expected 2- to 3-week delay over the rest of the century to an advance of 3 to 6 days. These findings demonstrate the critical role of sink limitation in governing the end of seasonal activity and reveal important constraints on future growing-season lengths and carbon uptake of trees.},

Overall, we observed a trend toward later EOS in 70\% of the pixels in Northern Hemisphere, with a mean rate of 0.18 ± 0.38 days yr−1. Warming preseason temperature was positively associated with the rate of EOS in most of our study area, except for arid/semi‐arid regions, where the precipitation sum played a dominant positive role. Interestingly, increased preseason insolation sum might also lead to a later date of EOS. In addition to the climatic effects on EOS, we found an influence of spring vegetation green‐up dates on EOS, albeit biome dependent.

This affects surface albedo, ecosystem carbon balance, and evapotranspiration, and the response of leaf phenology to climatic drivers has therefore received particular interest. However, despite considerable effort, models have failed to accurately reproduce phenology patterns, likely because mechanistic understanding is incomplete. Here, we show that earlier leaf flushing in response to a warm winter translated into earlier leaf senescence and even earlier leaf flushing in the following year. This legacy effect of winter warming on leaf phenology has important implications for understanding and modelling leaf phenology and its impact on ecosystem functioning, especially in relation to global warming, and is likely to open new research lines. Recent temperature increases have elicited strong phenological shifts in temperate tree species, with subsequent effects on photosynthesis. Here, we assess the impact of advanced leaf flushing in a winter warming experiment on the current year’s senescence and next year’s leaf flushing dates in two common tree species: Quercus robur L. and Fagus sylvatica L. Results suggest that earlier leaf flushing translated into earlier senescence, thereby partially offsetting the lengthening of the growing season. Moreover, saplings that were warmed in winter–spring 2009–2010 still exhibited earlier leaf flushing in 2011, even though the saplings had been exposed to similar ambient conditions for almost 1 y. Interestingly, for both species similar trends were found in mature trees using a long-term series of phenological records gathered from various locations in Europe. We hypothesize that this long-term legacy effect is related to an advancement of the endormancy phase (chilling phase) in response to the earlier autumnal senescence. Given the importance of phenology in plant and ecosystem functioning, and the prediction of more frequent extremely warm winters, our observations and postulated underlying mechanisms should be tested in other species.},

Plant phenology depends on temperature, and the current rapid climate change has revived interest in understanding and modeling the responses of plant phenology to the warming trend and the consequences thereof for ecosystems. Here, we review recent progresses in plant phenology and its interactions with climate change. Focusing on the start (leaf unfolding) and end (leaf coloring) of plant growing seasons, we show that the recent rapid expansion in ground‐ and remote sensing‐ based phenology data acquisition has been highly beneficial and has supported major advances in plant phenology research. Studies using multiple data sources and methods generally agree on the trends of advanced leaf unfolding and delayed leaf coloring due to climate change, yet these trends appear to have decelerated or even reversed in recent years. Our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the plant phenology responses to climate warming is still limited. The interactions between multiple drivers complicate the modeling and prediction of plant phenology changes. Furthermore, changes in plant phenology have important implications for ecosystem carbon cycles and ecosystem feedbacks to climate, yet the quantification of such impacts remains challenging. We suggest that future studies should primarily focus on using new observation tools to improve the understanding of tropical plant phenology, on improving process‐based phenology modeling, and on the scaling of phenology from species to landscape‐level.},

However, the effects of seasonally uneven climate warming—as is occurring in much of Europe, where the winter/spring months are warming twice as fast than the summer/autumn months—on autumn growth cessation (completion of overwintering buds) and leaf senescence, and possible carry-over effects between phenophases, remain under-investigated. We conducted experiments in which we exposed saplings of canopy and understory species to 4 °C warming in winter/spring, summer/autumn, or all year to disentangle how the timing of bud break, bud set completion, and leaf senescence is affected by seasonally uneven warming. All-year warming led to significantly delayed leaf senescence, but advanced bud set completion; summer/autumn warming only delayed leaf senescence; and winter/spring warming advanced both bud set and senescence. The non-parallel effects of warming on bud completion and leaf senescence show that leaf senescence alone is an inadequate proxy for autumn growth cessation in trees and counterintuitively suggest that continued uneven seasonal warming will advance cessation of primary growth in autumn, even when leaf senescence is delayed. Phenological responses to warming treatments (earlier spring onset, later autumn senescence) were more than twice as high in understory species than in canopy species, which can partly be explained by the absence of carry-over effects among phenophases in the former group. This underscores the need to consider differences among plant functional types when forecasting the future behaviour of ecosystems.},

              Aim
              Ongoing climate warming has been widely reported to delay autumn phenology, which in turn impacts carbon, water, energy and nutrient balances at regional and global scales. However, the underlying mechanisms of autumn phenology responses to climate change have not been fully elucidated. The aims of this study were to determine whether brightening that was defined as the increase of surface solar radiation and warming during recent decades affect autumn phenology in opposite directions and explore the underlying mechanisms.

              We investigated the temporal trends of leaf senescence, preseason temperature and radiation by separating the period of 1950–2016 into two sub‐periods (1950–1982 and 1983–2016) and determined the relationship between temperature, radiation and leaf senescence using partial correlation analysis.
            
            
              Results
              
                We found a significant warming and brightening trend after the 1980s in central Europe, yet this led to only slight delays in leaf senescence that cannot be explained by the well‐known positive correlation between leaf senescence and autumn warming. Interestingly, we found opposite effects between warming (partial correlation coefficient,

                r

              The results suggested that brightening accelerated the leaf senescence dates, counteracting the warming‐induced delays in leaf senescence, which may be attributed to photooxidative stress and/or sink limitation.

          Climate change is causing shifts in the growing seasons of plants1,2, affecting species performance and interactions3,4 as well as global carbon, water and nutrient cycles5,6. How the timing of autumn leaf senescence in extra-tropical forests will change remains unclear because of the complex seasonal interaction of climate warming, earlier and enhanced vegetation activity, and the annual day-length cycle7–10. Here we use experiments, long-term ground observations, and satellite-based vegetation monitoring to show that early-season and late-season warming have opposite effects on the onset and progression of leaf senescence, with a reversal occurring at the year’s longest day (summer solstice). Across {\textasciitilde}84\% of the northern forest area, increased temperature and vegetation activity before the solstice led to an earlier senescence onset (10\% greenness loss) of, on average, –1.6 ± 0.1 days-per-°C, while warmer post-solstice temperatures did not affect senescence onset but reduced its speed (progression to 50\% greenness loss) by 0.8 ± 0.1 days-per-°C. Due to the earlier senescence onset, the day at which autumn temperature starts driving senescence progression has been shifting to ever earlier dates, between 1951—2015 at a rate of –0.20 ± 0.07 days per year. These developmental constraints suggest that senescence will start earlier but progress more slowly in the future, revealing Northern Hemisphere-wide compensation effects on trends in growing-season length, caused by enhanced pre-solstice vegetation activity. This new mechanistic insight improves our ability to model carbon uptake by extra-tropical forests under climate change.},

              Plant phenology is highly sensitive to climate change, and shifts in autumnal foliar senescence are critical for plant productivity and nutrient cycling. Global warming has delayed the timing of foliar senescence, but the response of autumnal foliar senescence to nonuniform seasonal warming remains poorly understood, with experimental evidence in trees especially scarce. We therefore conducted a field experiment on seasonally asymmetric warming on 2‐year‐old larch (
              Larix principis
              ‐
              rupprechtii
              ) seedlings in two hydrologically contrasting years (wet 2018 and dry 2019). Autumnal and year‐round warming significantly delayed the timing of foliar senescence by 6 and 7 d in 2018, the wet year, with corresponding temperature sensitivities of 6.73 ± 1.47 and 8.26 ± 1.00 d/°C, respectively. Interestingly, the dates of senescence did not change across the warming treatments in 2019, the dry year. However, there was no significant effect of summer warming on the timing of foliar senescence neither in the wet nor dry year. The delayed autumnal foliar senescence was responsible for an increase in biomass only in the wet year, 2018. In contrast, summer warming, but not autumnal warming, increased the mortality of the seedlings in both 2018 and 2019. These results suggest that the hydrological conditions substantially modify the response of autumnal phenology and growth to seasonal warming. Autumnal warming increases growth, whereas summer warming could cause carbon starvation/hydraulic failure, reduce growth, and lead to higher mortality. Our results suggest that the functioning, ecosystem services, and sustainability of forests in the future depend on the strength and pattern of nonuniform seasonal warming. This study can inspire new research in phenology and tree growth in experiments with asymmetric warming.},

Yet, a poor understanding of the drivers of phenological processes, such as autumn leaf senescence in deciduous trees, limits our capacity to estimate growing-season lengths under climate change. While temperature has been shown to be an important driver of autumn leaf senescence, carbon source–sink dynamics have been proposed as a mechanism that could help explain variation of this important process. According to the carbon sink limitation hypothesis, senescence is regulated by the interplay between plant carbon source and sink dynamics, so that senescence occurs later upon low carbon inputs (source) and earlier upon low carbon demand (sink). Here, we manipulated carbon source–sink dynamics in birch saplings (
              Betula pendula
              ) to test the relevance of carbon sink limitation for autumn leaf senescence and photosynthetic decline in a widespread deciduous tree. Specifically, we conducted a gradient of leaf and bud removal treatments and monitored the effects on autumnal declines in net photosynthesis and the timing of leaf senescence. In line with the carbon sink limitation hypothesis, we observed that leaf removal tended to increase total leaf-level autumn photosynthesis and delayed the timing of senescence. Conversely, we did not observe an effect of bud removal on either photosynthesis or senescence, which was likely caused by the fact that our bud removal treatment did not considerably affect the plant carbon sink. While we cannot fully rule out that the observed effect of leaf removal was influenced by possible treatment-level differences in leaf age or soil resource availability, our results provide support for the hypothesis of carbon sink limitation as a driver of growing-season length and move the scientific field closer to narrowing the uncertainty in climate change predictions.},

              Autumn senescence regulates multiple aspects of ecosystem function, along with associated feedbacks to the climate system. Despite its importance, current understanding of the drivers of senescence is limited, leading to a large spread in predictions of how the timing of senescence, and thus the length of the growing season, will change under future climate conditions. The most commonly held paradigm is that temperature and photoperiod are the primary controls, which suggests a future extension of the autumnal growing season as global temperatures rise. Here, using two decades of ground‐ and satellite‐based observations of temperate deciduous forest phenology, we show that the timing of autumn senescence is correlated with the timing of spring budburst across the entire eastern United States. On a year‐to‐year basis, an earlier/later spring was associated with an earlier/later autumn senescence, both for individual species and at a regional scale. We use the observed relationship to develop a novel model of autumn phenology. In contrast to current phenology models, this model predicts that the potential response of autumn phenology to future climate change is strongly limited by the impact of climate change on spring phenology. Current models of autumn phenology therefore may overpredict future increases in the length of the growing season, with subsequent impacts for modeling future

However, although the progressive warming process is asymmetrical across seasons in temperate and boreal regions, the consistency of spring phenological response to nonuniform seasonal warming has not been well studied. Furthermore, the diﬀerent responses of budburst and leaf unfolding to seasonally uneven warming have not been fully explored. We investigated the responses of budburst and leaf unfolding in two-year-old larch (Larix principis-rupprechtii) seedlings to seasonally asymmetric warming treatments (with passive warming applied in open-top chambers) in northern China. We found that spring warming signiﬁcantly advanced budburst and leaf unfolding by 7 and 2 days, respectively; year-round warming advanced budburst by 4 days but had no impact on the timing of leaf unfolding. Summer and winter warming had no eﬀects on the timing and duration of spring phenophases. Notably, spring leaf unfolding was signiﬁcantly delayed, by 2 days, following an autumnal warming, i.e., there was a carry-over eﬀect (a 1-day delay in leaf senescence delayed leaf unfolding by 0.3 day in the next spring). The temperature sensitivities of budburst and leaf unfolding in the spring warming treatment (9.56 days/°C and 2.66 days/°C, respectively) were signiﬁcantly greater than those in the year-round warming treatment (6.43 days/°C and 0.66 days/°C, respectively). We also found a trade-oﬀ relationship between the durations of budburst and leaf unfolding in the spring and year-round warming treatments. Our demonstration of (i) diﬀerences in the magnitude of responses between budburst and leaf unfolding, and (ii) the carry-over eﬀect under non-uniform seasonal warming, should be incorporated into modeling simulations of spring phenological responses to future warming scenarios. Overall, our ﬁndings would have some critical implications for resistance and performance (e.g., frost damage risk and carbon uptake) in the seedling stage of plantation establishment under ongoing climate warming scenarios.},

	abstract = {▪ Abstract Nitrate is the major source of nitrogen (N) for plants growing in aerobic soils. However, the NO3− ion is also used by plants as a signal to reprogram plant metabolism and to trigger changes in plant architecture. A striking example is the way that a root system can react to a localized source of NO3− by activating the NO3− uptake system and proliferating lateral roots preferentially within the NO3−-rich zone. That roots are able to respond autonomously in this fashion implies the existence of local signaling pathways that are sensitive to local changes in the external NO3− concentration. On the other hand, long-range signaling pathways are also needed to modulate these responses according to the plant\&apos;s N status and to coordinate the allocation of resources between the root and the shoot. This review examines these signaling mechanisms and their interactions with sugar-sensing and hormonal response pathways.},

	abstract = {Climate-driven changes in phenology have widespread effects on ecological interactions and species’ abundances. Most predictions of changes in phenology and the consequences for ecology and conservation are based on research in temperate systems. Climate-driven changes in phenology are largely undocumented in subtropical regions, which host much of the world’s biodiversity. Factors important to regulating phenology in temperate systems (e.g. winter chilling requirements) are likely weak or absent in subtropical ecosystems; plant phenology in these regions could respond to climate differently than in the temperate zone. Here we examine flowering phenology data for 105 plant species based on herbarium specimens and photographs from 1911 to 2015 in the southern subtropical Nanling region in south China. Temperatures in this region warmed 0.3°C over the 105-year study period, and most plant species flowered earlier over time, although species varied substantially in the magnitude of phenological response to warming temperatures. Spring flowering times advanced in response to warming temperatures in late summer and early autumn and in early spring, with late summer and early autumn temperatures having almost twice as strong an effect on spring flowering times as early spring temperatures (−4.7 versus −2.5 days °C−1). This strong effect of late summer and early autumn temperatures is very different from temperate systems and has substantial implications for anticipating future changes in phenology. The temperatures in late summer and early autumn may affect spring phenology by accelerating bud formation or initial growth. Warming January temperature delayed summer flowering and advanced winter flowering. Increases in precipitation during April to June also tended to delay summer flowering. Autumn flowering species showed inconsistent responses to warming. These results highlight important differences between climate-driven changes in phenology in temperate and subtropical areas. Understanding these differences will be important in understanding the effects of climate change on vegetation phenology and ecosystem processes.},

              Aim
              The aims of this study were to evaluate the changes in the length of the time period between leaf‐out and flowering across temperate tree species, and associate these changes with potential physiological and environmental drivers to enhance mechanistic insight into these phenomena.
            
            
              Location
              Central Europe.
            
            
              Time period
              1980–2016.
            
            
              Major taxa studied
              Six temperate woody species.
            
            
              Methods
              Statistical analyses were carried out based on long‐term ground observations of both spring leaf‐out and flowering across temperate tree species during 1980–2016, a period characterized by rapid warming.
            
            
              Results
              
                The temperature sensitivity of flowering (−5.4 ± 0.04 days/℃, mean ± 
                SE
                ) was higher than that of leaf‐out (−4.6 ± 0.04 days/℃) across all species, regardless of whether leaf‐out occurred before or after flowering. This study postulates a hypothesis attributing the different temperature sensitivities to different thermal sensitivities, thermal requirements, and photoperiodic controls.
              
            
            
              Main conclusions
              The larger temperature sensitivity of flowering than leaf‐out resulted in an extended time period between flowering and leaf‐out in species that bloom before leafing out, but a shorter time period between these phenophases in species with the opposite strategy. We would like to emphasize the importance of changes in time period between different phenophases, and we recommend conducting experimental research to reveal the underlying mechanisms of plant phenology response to climate change, and to explore its potential ecological implications.},

Predicting leaf senescence dates (LSD) with high accuracy is thus a prerequisite for better understanding the climate–ecosystem interactions.

In this study, first, we used 19972 site‐year records (848 sites and four deciduous tree species) from the PAN European Phenology network to calibrate and evaluate six leaf senescence models during the period 1980–2013. Second, we extended the spatial analysis by repeating the procedure across Europe using satellite‐derived end of growing season and a forest map.

The CDD models generally matched the observed LSD at species level and its interannual variation, but were limited in explaining the inter‐site variations, indicating that other environmental cues need to be considered in future model development. The discrepancies remaining between model simulations and observations highlight the need of manipulation studies to elucidate the mechanisms behind the leaf senescence process and to make current models more realistic.},

            Climate models project warmer summer temperatures will increase the frequency and heat severity of droughts in temperate forests of Eastern North America. Hotter droughts are increasingly documented to affect tree growth and forest dynamics, with critical impacts on tree mortality, carbon sequestration and timber provision. The growing acknowledgement of the dominant role of drought timing on tree vulnerability to water deficit raises the issue of our limited understanding of radial growth phenology for most temperate tree species. Here, we use well-replicated dendrometer band data sampled frequently during the growing season to assess the growth phenology of 610 trees from 15 temperate species over 6 years. Patterns of diameter growth follow a typical logistic shape, with growth rates reaching a maximum in June, and then decreasing until process termination. On average, we find that diffuse-porous species take 16–18 days less than other wood-structure types to put on 50\% of their annual diameter growth. However, their peak growth rate occurs almost a full month later than ring-porous and conifer species (ca. 24 ± 4 days; mean ± 95\% credible interval). Unlike other species, the growth phenology of diffuse-porous species in our dataset is highly correlated with their spring foliar phenology. We also find that the later window of growth in diffuse-porous species, coinciding with peak evapotranspiration and lower water availability, exposes them to a higher water deficit of 88 ± 19 mm (mean ± SE) during their peak growth than ring-porous and coniferous species (15 ± 35 mm and 30 ± 30 mm, respectively). Given the high climatic sensitivity of wood formation, our findings highlight the importance of wood porosity as one predictor of species climatic sensitivity to the projected intensification of the drought regime in the coming decades.},

            Spring phenology of temperate forest trees has advanced substantially over the last decades due to climate warming, but this advancement is slowing down despite continuous temperature rise. The decline in spring advancement is often attributed to winter warming, which could reduce chilling and thus delay dormancy release. However, mechanistic evidence of a phenological response to warmer winter temperatures is missing. We aimed to understand the contrasting effects of warming on plants leaf phenology and to disentangle temperature effects during different seasons. With a series of monthly experimental warming by ca. 2.4°C from late summer until spring, we quantified phenological responses of forest tree to warming for each month separately, using seedlings of four common European tree species. To reveal the underlying mechanism, we tracked the development of dormancy depth under ambient conditions as well as directly after each experimental warming. In addition, we quantified the temperature response of leaf senescence. As expected, warmer spring temperatures led to earlier leaf‐out. The advancing effect of warming started already in January and increased towards the time of flushing, reaching 2.5 days/°C. Most interestingly, however, warming in October had the opposite effect and delayed spring phenology by 2.4 days/°C on average; despite six months between the warming and the flushing. The switch between the delaying and advancing effect occurred already in December. We conclude that not warmer winters but rather the shortening of winter, i.e., warming in autumn, is a major reason for the decline in spring phenology.},

              In temperate trees, the timings of plant growth onset and cessation affect biogeochemical cycles, water, and energy balance. Currently, phenological studies largely focus on specific phenophases and on their responses to warming. How differently spring phenology responds to the warming and cooling, and affects the subsequent phases, has not been yet investigated in trees. Here, we exposed saplings of
              Fagus sylvatica
              L. to warmer and cooler climate during the winter 2013–2014 by conducting a reciprocal transplant experiment between two elevations (1,340 vs. 371 m a.s.l., ca. 6°C difference) in the Swiss Jura mountains. To test the legacy effects of earlier or later budburst on the budset timing, saplings were moved back to their original elevation shortly after the occurrence of budburst in spring 2014. One degree decrease in air temperature in winter/spring resulted in a delay of 10.9 days in budburst dates, whereas one degree of warming advanced the date by 8.8 days. Interestingly, we also found an asymmetric effect of the warmer winter vs. cooler winter on the budset timing in late summer. Budset of saplings that experienced a cooler winter was delayed by 31 days compared to the control, whereas it was delayed by only 10 days in saplings that experienced a warmer winter. Budburst timing in 2015 was not significantly impacted by the artificial advance or delay of the budburst timing in 2014, indicating that the legacy effects of the different phenophases might be reset during each winter. Adapting phenological models to the whole annual phenological cycle, and considering the different response to cooling and warming, would improve predictions of tree phenology under future climate warming conditions.},

            Leaf phenology of temperate ecosystems is shifting in response to global warming. This affects surface albedo, ecosystem carbon balance, and evapotranspiration, and the response of leaf phenology to climatic drivers has therefore received particular interest. However, despite considerable effort, models have failed to accurately reproduce phenology patterns, likely because mechanistic understanding is incomplete. Here, we show that earlier leaf flushing in response to a warm winter translated into earlier leaf senescence and even earlier leaf flushing in the following year. This legacy effect of winter warming on leaf phenology has important implications for understanding and modelling leaf phenology and its impact on ecosystem functioning, especially in relation to global warming, and is likely to open new research lines.
          , 
            
              Recent temperature increases have elicited strong phenological shifts in temperate tree species, with subsequent effects on photosynthesis. Here, we assess the impact of advanced leaf flushing in a winter warming experiment on the current year’s senescence and next year’s leaf flushing dates in two common tree species:
              Quercus robur
              L. and
              Fagus sylvatica
              L. Results suggest that earlier leaf flushing translated into earlier senescence, thereby partially offsetting the lengthening of the growing season. Moreover, saplings that were warmed in winter–spring 2009–2010 still exhibited earlier leaf flushing in 2011, even though the saplings had been exposed to similar ambient conditions for almost 1 y. Interestingly, for both species similar trends were found in mature trees using a long-term series of phenological records gathered from various locations in Europe. We hypothesize that this long-term legacy effect is related to an advancement of the endormancy phase (chilling phase) in response to the earlier autumnal senescence. Given the importance of phenology in plant and ecosystem functioning, and the prediction of more frequent extremely warm winters, our observations and postulated underlying mechanisms should be tested in other species.},

	abstract = {Multidecadal ground and remote-sensing observations of Northern Hemisphere forests show that, at the decadal scale, autumn senescence dates and total net carbon assimilation are positively related, despite a negative relationship at the annual scale. This suggests that acclimation relieves the leaf longevity constraints. Leaf phenology is key for regulating total growing-season mass and energy fluxes. Long-term temporal trends towards earlier leaf unfolding are observed across Northern Hemisphere forests. Phenological dates also vary between years, whereby end-of-season (EOS) dates correlate positively with start-of-season (SOS) dates and negatively with growing-season total net CO\_2 assimilation ( A \_net). These associations have been interpreted as the effect of a constrained leaf longevity or of premature carbon (C) sink saturation—with far-reaching consequences for long-term phenology projections under climate change and rising CO\_2. Here, we use multidecadal ground and remote-sensing observations to show that the relationships between A \_net and EOS are opposite at the interannual and the decadal time scales. A decadal trend towards later EOS persists in parallel with a trend towards increasing A \_net—in spite of the negative A \_net–EOS relationship at the interannual scale. This finding is robust against the use of diverse observations and models. Results indicate that acclimation of phenology has enabled plants to transcend a constrained leaf longevity or premature C sink saturation over the course of several decades, leading to a more effective use of available light and a sustained extension of the vegetation CO\_2 uptake season over time.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Our understanding of the natural variability of hydroclimate before the instrumental period (ca. 1900 CE in the United States) is largely dependent on tree-ring-based reconstructions. Large-scale soil moisture reconstructions from a network of tree-ring chronologies have greatly improved our understanding of the spatial and temporal variability in hydroclimate conditions, particularly extremes of both drought and pluvial (wet) events. However, certain regions within these large-scale network reconstructions in the US are modeled by few tree-ring chronologies. Further, many of the chronologies currently publicly available on the International Tree-Ring Data Bank (ITRDB) were collected in the 1980s and 1990s, and thus our understanding of the sensitivity of radial growth to soil moisture in the US is based on a period that experienced multiple extremely severe droughts and neglects the impacts of recent, rapid global change. In this study, we expanded the tree-ring network of the Ohio River valley in the US, a region with sparse coverage. We used a total of 72 chronologies across 15 species to examine how increasing the density of the tree-ring network influences the representation of reconstructing the Palmer Meteorological Drought Index (PMDI). Further, we tested how the sampling date and therefore the calibration period influenced the reconstruction models by creating reconstructions that ended in the year 1980 and compared them to reconstructions ending in 2010 from the same chronologies. We found that increasing the density of the tree-ring network resulted in reconstructed values that better matched the spatial variability of instrumentally recorded droughts and, to a lesser extent, pluvials. By extending the calibration period to 2010 compared to 1980, the sensitivity of tree rings to PMDI decreased in the southern portion of our region where severe drought conditions have been absent over recent decades. We emphasize the need of building a high-density tree-ring network to better represent the spatial variability of past droughts and pluvials. Further, chronologies on the ITRDB need updating regularly to better understand how the sensitivity of tree rings to climate may vary through time.},

	abstract = {Reduction in size and tissue nutrient concentration is widely considered to increase seedling drought resistance in dry and oligotrophic plantation sites. However, much evidence indicates that increase in size and tissue nutrient concentration improves seedling survival in Mediterranean forest plantations. This suggests that the ecophysiological processes and functional attributes relevant for early seedling survival in Mediterranean climate must be reconsidered. We propose a ecophysiological conceptual model for seedling survival in Mediterranean-climate plantations to provide a physiological explanation of the frequent positive relationship between outplanting performance and seedling size and nutrient concentration. The model considers the physiological processes outlined in the plantation establishment model of Burdett (Can J For Res 20:415–427, 1990), but incorporates other physiological processes that drive seedling survival, such as N remobilization, carbohydrate storage and plant hydraulics. The model considers that seedling survival in Mediterranean climates is linked to high growth capacity during the wet season. The model is for container plants and is based on three main principles, (1) Mediterranean climates are not dry the entire year but usually have two seasons of contrasting water availability; (2) summer drought is the main cause of seedling mortality; in this context, deep and large roots is a key trait for avoiding lethal water stress; (3) attainment of large root systems in the dry season is promoted when seedlings have high growth during the wet season. High growth is achieved when seedlings can divert large amount of resources to support new root and shoot growth. Functional traits that confer high photosynthesis, nutrient remobilization capacity, and non-structural carbohydrate storage promote high growth. Increases in seedling size and nutrient concentration strongly affect these physiological processes. Traits that confer high drought resistance are of low value during the wet season because hinder growth capacity. We provide specific evidence to support the model and finally we discuss its implications and the factors that may alter the frequent increase in performance with increase in seedling size and tissue nutrient concentration.},

	abstract = {Les cultures traditionnelles en serre comportent une periode tardive d'endurcissement qui retarde l'irrigation et la fertilisation des semis de Picea mariana pour promouvoir l'endurcissement au froid. Puisque le prelevement de nutriments est limite sans supplementation de fertilisation, la croissance pendant la periode d'endurcissement peut conduire a une dilution interne des nutriments, une situation prejudiciable pour les performances au champ des plants. Nous avons examine si la fertilisation tardive, appliquee par des apports massifs peut contrebalancer la dilution et accroitre les reserves de nutriments dans les semis eleves conventionnellement ou les nutriments apportes avant l'endurcissement. On a teste un melange de fertilisant NPK liberant 0,12, 24 ou 48 mg d'azote par semis pendant 9 semaines apres le debourrement. Le poids sec des racines et des pousses s'est accru de 104 et 42 \% pendant l'endurcissement. Cependant la biomasse des semis a ete inchangee par une fertilisation tardive, mais le prelevement d'azote s'est accru de 44 a 167 \%, indiquant une consommation de luxe. Une supplementation en K evite une dilution en K des tissus, ce qui arrive souvent avec un apport important d'azote. Un essai a 13 semaines sur un sol pour essais biologiques, extrait d'une station boreale, a montre que la croissance et l'allocation des nutriments etaient significativement augmentees par de grandes reserves d'azote accumule apres des apports intensifs de nutriments. Environ 72 a 80 \% de N requis pour la croissance des nouvelles pousses provenaient du cycle interne, demontrant l'importance des apports pour augmenter les retranslocations. Un apport intermediaire (24 mg N) etait plus efficace pour promouvoir l'accumulation de N et la croissance des deux types de semis. La survie a ete reduite (30 \%) seulement pour la plus forte dose. Les resultats de cette etude ont demontre l'avantage potentiel de ces pratiques pour l'amelioration de la croissance des semis dans les stations forestieres du Nord.},

	abstract = {Forest restoration projects with Holm oak (Quercus ilex) have had limited success, mostly due to water stress after planting and poor plant quality. Recent studies indicated that large and nutrient rich plants perform better in Mediterranean areas, suggesting that late-season fertilization may improve plant quality and field performance. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of late-season fertilization on the quality of Holm oak seedlings, as determined by morphological, nutritional, and water relations analyses. We grew Holm oak nursery seedlings under 5 different late-season fertilization regimes and then analyzed morphological characteristics, nutritional status, and water relations parameters of the fertilization groups at the end of the nursery period. We also analyzed the effect of fertilization on nutritional status by use of vector nomograms. Our results indicated that late-season NPK fertilization improved shoot and root growth, and the overall nutritional status of seedlings. The lack of late-season fertilization leads to nutrient deficiency in plants, whilst the application of imbalanced fertilization treatments may trigger nutrient luxury consumption and nutrient dilution, pointing out the importance of NPK proportions in the fertilizer. Moreover, late-season fertilization with nitrogen might improve the drought resistance of seedling by enhancing their osmotic adjustment.},

	abstract = {Eucalyptus globulus is widely used in productive exotic plantations but the expansion of these plantations is limited by low temperatures, as its cold hardening capacity is limited (0.5 to 3.0 °C). It is not well understood how nursery fertilisation affects the field performance of plants. This led us to study the effect of three mineral nutrients (N, P and K) on both plant quality and frost tolerance. The experiment comprised eight growth treatments in which a high dose (H-) or a low dose (L-) of each nutrient was applied. Nitrogen was the nutrient that determined shoot growth, new root growth after transplanting (root egress), frost tolerance and field performance. Performance was better with treatment H-N than with treatment L-N, leaf nitrogen contents being 1.53 and 0.89\% respectively. The effects of phosphorus and potassium were not significant between treatments for any parameter. The exception was P which, when interacting with N, favoured root egress for the H-N treatment. It was concluded that nursery fertilisation offers a management tool for eucalyptus growers concerned with plant stock quality.RésuméEucalyptus globulus est largement utilisé dans des plantations exotiques productives, mais l’expansion de ces plantations est limitée par les basses températures, étant donné que l’endurcissement potentiel au froid de cette espèce est limité (0,5 à 3,0 °C).

Les effets du phosphore et du potassium n’ont été significatifs pour aucun des paramètres. L’exception a concerné le phosphore qui lorsqu’il était en interaction avec l’azote a favorisé l’émission de racines dans le traitement H-N.

	abstract = {Despite evidences that Holm oak has a high plasticity and great adaptability, there is limited or contradictory knowledge of the morphological and physiological variability of this species. Holm oak has been widely used for reforestation projects in Mediterranean areas, but has frequently shown poor field performance. We hypothesized that Holm oak has inter-population differences in physiological responses to abiotic stressors that could affect reforestation success. The influence of nursery culture on the characteristics of Holm oaks from different provenances has not been explored in depth. Thus, we studied the effect of nursery autumn fertilization on morphological traits, frost tolerance, root growth potential, and nutritional status of two Spanish provenances of Holm oak, La Alcarria (a region with inland Mediterranean climate) and Sierra Morena Occidental (a region with a warm coastal Mediterranean climate). There were significant differences between the provenances in frost tolerance, biomass allocation, and leaf nutrient content, suggesting a role of genetic factors. The leaves of seedlings from La Alcarria had less visual damage at −12°C than seedlings from the warmer provenance (45\% vs. 92\%). Seedlings from La Alcarria, compared to those from Sierra Morena, had higher leaf P concentration (0.17\% vs. 0.15\%), greater stem diameter (3.1 mm vs. 2.7 mm), lower shoot-to-root dry mass ratio (0.46 vs. 0.53), and lower slenderness (4.03 vs. 5.31). For both provenances, N autumn fertilization improved growth, root growth potential, cold hardiness, and nutritional status of seedlings. We suggest that forest reforestation programs should consider to a greater extent Holm oak provenances and their tolerances to different abiotic stressors.},

	abstract = {Holm oak (Quercus ilex ssp. ballota [Desf.] Samp) is one of the most important species in forest communities of the western Mediterranean Basin, but is very vulnerable to environmental stress during the first years of its life. In particular, summer drought and winter frosts limit the distribution, survival, and growth of Holm oak. These two stress factors can lead to plasmolysis and/or oxidative stress. We hypothesized that autumn fertilization with nitrogen (N) can improve plant tolerance to these abiotic stress factors and improve plant quality and therefore reforestation success. A 12-week autumn application of 30 or 60 mg N (plus 70 mg N applied to both treatments during the previous 28 weeks in the nursery, i.e. 100 and 130 mg N in total, respectively) improved overall growth, root growth capacity, frost tolerance, and nutritional status of plants relative to plants given 0.0 and 1.5 mg autumnal N, and had no negative effect on seedling response to water stress. A very small increment in N doses during the autumn (1.5 vs. 0.0 mg N) improved some morphological parameters, such as stem diameter (D) and shoot dry weight, and physiological parameters, such as total antioxidant activity. The highest autumnal N dose (60 mg) increased leaf nutrient content without decreasing the concentration, but had a tendency to reduce frost tolerance relative to seedlings given a lower autumnal N dose (30 mg).},

	abstract = {The planting environment of Mediterranean areas is highly challenging as summer drought and winter frost jeopardize survival, and soil infertility limits establishment success. We review the potential for seedling nutrient loading to alleviate these post-planting stresses. A growing body of evidence indicates that nitrogen (N) rich seedlings have improved field performance in Mediterranean environments, due to their ability to grow new roots rapidly and out-compete weeds. In addition, frost resistance during hardening is crucial for relatively cold inland nurseries; recent research shows a positive relationship between N and shoot frost resistance though a knowledge gap exists regarding the influence of nutrition on root frost resistance. Some new evidence also implicates phosphorus as an important driver of seedling response in the Mediterranean due to its influence on root growth and physiology. Nutrient status influences other functional attributes critical to survival in Mediterranean areas, such as drought tolerance, root hydraulic conductivity, and mycorrhization. In light of the apparent benefits of high nutrient reserves for seedling performance in Mediterranean areas, we also review techniques for nursery nutrient loading. Exponential fertilization can be applied when species’ growth patterns match this application regime. However, many Mediterranean species exhibit episodic growth indicating that constant or fall fertilization could be more effective in reaching loading. In particular, late-season fertilization has shown good potential to avert nutrient dilution in the fall and increase frost resistance. Several needs for future research are identified, with special emphasis on the necessity to match fertilization regimes to species ecological traits and planting conditions.},

The fertility treatments (mg N plant−1) were control (0), 25E, 100E, and 100C. Subsequently, 1-year-old plants were transplanted under simulated soil fertility gradients in a greenhouse to evaluate effects of nutrient loading and post-transplant fertility on seedling performance. Post-transplant fertility consisted of fertilizing plants at two rates (0 vs. 200 mg N plant−1). A water-soluble fertilizer 20-20-20 was supplied in both nursery and post-transplant experiments. Nutrient loading increased plant N content by 73\% in 100E and by 75\% in 100C relative to controls, although no significant differences were detected between constant and exponential fertilization regimes at the 100 mg N plant−1 rate. When transplanted, nutrient loading promoted post-transplant root growth relative to shoot, implicating potential to confer competitive advantage to loaded holm oak seedlings after trans-planting. In contrast, post-transplant fertility increased new shoot dry mass by 140\% as well as N, P and K content relative to controls. Results suggest that holm oak seedlings can be successfully nutrient loaded in the nursery at higher fertility rates, improving its potential to extend new roots, but alternative fertilization regimes and schedules that better fit nutrient availability to the growth rhythm and conservative strategy of this species must be tested.},

The resulting foliar concentrations of N were 11.0, 13.1 and 15.8 g kg−1, respectively. Seedling height (mean 26.0 cm) did not differ among treatments. The next spring, the seedlings were tested in two experiments. (1) The seedlings were transplanted into pots containing sandy soil in the greenhouse, where they were fertilized with either pure water or nutrient solution (22 mg N l−1). (2) The outplanting performance of the autumn-fertilized seedlings was tested on a sandy field. In the greenhouse experiment, the autumn fertilization level affected height growth and root egress of the seedlings significantly, but less than fertilization with a nutrient solution after planting. In the field experiment, during the first season after transplanting shoot growth of the seedlings increased with the level of autumn fertilization. After the second and third seasons, the seedling stem volume was highest with the highest level of autumn fertilization. These results suggest that, by improving the preplanting nutrient status of seedlings, the growth of shoot, stem diameter and root biomass can be enhanced after planting, especially on nutrient-poor soils. However, heavier autumn fertilization than that used here may yield a greater and more persistent increment in growth.},

Samp.), cork oak (Quercus suber L.), wild olive tree (Olea europaea L. ssp. europaea var. sylvestris) and lentisk tree (Pistacia lentiscus L.) are extensively used for such plantations. In order to determine the environmental factor that induces cold hardening most effectively and the mechanisms that are involved in this process, seven month-old nursery seedlings were taken to three growth chambers during the hardening phase and submitted to: 22/17oC (day/night) and decreasing photoperiod from 12 to 8 h (Ph chamber), 12 h photoperiod and decreasing temperature from 22/17oC to 8/3oC (T chamber); and progressive reductions in temperature and photoperiod (PhT chamber). The variation of morpho-physiological traits was assessed. Reducing the photoperiod by up to 8 h did not stop the growth in height and diameter. Air temperatures below 8oC reduced substantially height growth, mainly in Quercus species, but not diameter growth. Reducing the temperature proved much more effective for cold hardening than reducing the photoperiod. Low temperatures induced seedlings to accumulate non-structural carbohydrates (soluble sugars in the leaves and roots, and starch in the roots), and to improve cold hardiness. Differences among species were observed in cold hardiness, with Q. ilex {\textgreater} Q. suber ≥ P. lentiscus ≥ O. europaea. The maximum level of cold hardiness achieved in this experiment by Q. suber and Q. ilex was reached when seedlings accumulated 775-800 h8 (hours ≤ 8°C), 750 h8 in O. europaea and 725 h8 in P. lentiscus. Finally, measuring chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm) after a freezing test was useful in estimating the cold hardiness of these species, providing results in less than two days for plant quality purposes. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_},

	abstract = {In this study the effect of summer fertilization on the initiation of frost hardening of containerized second-year Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seedlings is studied. During the second growing season three different fertilization programs (water soluble NPK with micronutrients) determined by electrical conductivity of peat water extract (0.2, 0.5 and 1.2 mS cm-1) were initiated. The growth and nutrient concentrations of needles were monitored during the fertilization period. The frost hardiness of seedlings was assessed on four separate occasions at two week intervals from August 7 to September 18. This assessment was based on artificial freezing tests and visual damage scoring of tissue browning on current-year needles. Clear differences in foliar N, P and K concentrations were observed between the fertilization treatments. Fertilization prolonged the growing period of needles and increased root collar diameter. In all the tests, the highest fertilization level resulted in the highest level of frost hardiness. The difference between the fertilization treatments ranged from 1 °C to 2.2 °C. Frost hardiness increased with an increase in foliar nitrogen concentration and slightly less consistently with increases in foliar phosphorus and potassium concentrations.},

In the field, there were no differences in growth among seedlings from the three greenhouse treatments, but fertilization at planting increased growth.

Samp) and one deciduous (Q. faginea Lam.), across different scenarios of nutrient and water availabilities. Three fertilization (5, 50 and 200 mg of N per plant and growing period) and watering (28–39, 55–71 and 70–85 g H2O 100 gsoil−1 gravimetric soil water) treatments were applied to current-year seedlings between May and October 2002 in two independent experiments. The three species showed a similar response to fertilization, storing nitrogen instead of increasing biomass, in agreement with adaptations to nutrient-poor habitats. However, they differed in their responses to water, reflecting the different water requirements in the field: Q. coccifera, from arid zones, showed no response to water regarding DM and St; Q. faginea, from humid zones, required higher water availability to simultaneously increase growth and storage; while Q. ilex, spanning over most of the water availability range, exhibited a balanced increase of both functions when water increased moderately. In the two evergreen species, N concentration increased with water supply, whereas the reverse occurred in Q. faginea. The latter species favoured growth over storage at moderate water supply (according to its more competitive strategy), although it was the species which accumulated more St and N at the end of the experiments (autumn).RésuméNous avons comparé la masse sèche (DM) et le stockage d’amidon (St) et d’azote (N) chez des semis de chênes méditerranéens, deux à feuilles persistantes (Quercus coccifera L. et Quercus ilex L. subsp. Ballota (Desf.) Samp) et un à feuilles caduques (Q. faginea Lam.), pour différents scénarios de nutrition et de disponibilités en eau : trois niveaux de fertilisation (5, 50 et 200 mg d’azote par plant et période de croissance) et d’arrosage (28–39, 55–71 et 70–85 g H2O pour 100 g de sol). Ces traitements ont été appliqués l’année en cours des semis entre mai et octobre dans deux expérimentations indépendantes. Les trois espèces ont montré une réponse similaire à la fertilisation, stockant l’azote plutôt que d’accroître la biomasse, en accord avec les adaptations aux habitats ayant une nutrition pauvre. Cependant ils diffèrent dans leurs réponses à l’alimentation hydrique, reflétant leurs besoins différents en eau dans la nature : Quercus coccifera, venant des zones arides ne montre pas de réponse à l’alimentation hydrique pour ce qui concerne DM et St; Q. faginea, issu de zones humides, demande une disponibilité en eau plus importante pour simultanément croître et stocker, tandis que Quercus ilex, couvrant davantage l’étendue des possibilités de disponibilité en eau, présente un accroissement équilibré des deux fonctions lorsque l’alimentation en eau s’accroît modérément. Chez les deux espèces à feuilles persistantes, la concentration en azote s’accroît avec la fourniture d’eau, alors que l’inverse se produit chez Q. faginea. Cette dernière espèce favorise la croissance sur le stockage pour des apports en eau modérés (conformément à une meilleure stratégie de compétition), bien que cela soit l’espèce qui a accumulé le plus N et St à la fin des expérimentations (automne).},

	abstract = {Conventional nursery culture of containerized black spruce (Picea mariana Mill. B.S.P.) seedlings usually involves a late- season interval, commonly called the "hardening period", when fertilization and water are withheld to promote frost-hardiness. Conside- rable growth may occur during this time which may lead to internal nutrient dilution, a condition often detrimental to subsequent field performance. Continued late season fertilization (at 6 or 12 mg N seedling -1 ) of seedlings during the hardening period was tested as a technique to prevent late season nutrient dilution and possibly to increase nutrient reserves. Root growth was increased much more than shoot growth during this period. Late-season fertilization raised N, P and K uptake as much as 164, 70 and 32\% respectively, compared to conventionally fertilized seedlings with no late-season fertilization. Depending on dose rate and pre-hardening nutrient loading, this technique demonstrates the potential to build internal nutrient reserves in seedlings. Nutrient dilution was temporarily averted by late- season fertilization suggesting that intensive and prolonged nutrient supplementation during the hardening period may further delay or eliminate nutrient dilution in seedlings. black spruce / hardening period / nitrogen / nutrient dilution / nutrient loading},

	abstract = {AbstractForest plantations have been extensively used to combat desertification. In drylands, harsh climate conditions and unfertile soils often preclude seedling establishment. The improvement in seedling quality by manipulating nutrient availability could contribute to increase planting success. However, morpho-functional traits defining optimum seedling quality in drylands, and the fertilization schemes to achieve them, are still under discussion. Several studies suggest that well fertilized seedlings may perform better than nutrient limited seedlings in these environments. However, recent works have shown opposite results. In this review, we discuss the concept of seedling quality in drylands based on an evaluation of the effects of nutrient manipulation on seedling morpho-functional traits and field performance. According to existing data, we hypothesize that nutrient-limited small seedlings may be better adapted to arid environments and unfavorable microsites, where access to water is uncertain and a conservative water use strategy may be advantageous. In contrast, in dry sub-humid areas, areas with deep soils, protected from excess radiation, and areas where irrigation is feasible, well-fertilized big seedlings with high root growth potential may have more chances of success. We discuss this theory in the context of the multiple objectives of dryland restoration and the environmental constrains posed by these areas, and identify knowledge gaps that should be targeted to test our hypothesis.},

We evaluated the importance of nursery nutrient loading as a new approach to enhance forest restoration on abandoned mine lands. Northern red oak (Quercus rubra) and White oak (Q. alba) seedlings were nitrogen (N) loaded for 18 weeks at a bareroot nursery in southern Indiana, United States. Fertility treatments followed conventional or modified exponential functions to synchronize N supply with plant demand. Subsequently, nursery-grown seedlings were outplanted the following year onto a mine reclamation site in southwestern Indiana to evaluate effects of nursery N loading on first-year field performance. Nursery N loading promoted total plant dry mass production 25–129\% in Red oak and 50–184\% in White oak compared to unfertilized plants. Nitrogen loading increased N content 88–145\% and potassium (K) content 16–71\% for Red oak and N content 124–250\% and K content 16–93\% for White oak relative to controls. When outplanted, N loading resulted in high seedling survival ({\textgreater}84\%) and increased total plant dry mass production 14–30\% for Red oak and 23–52\% for White oak. Nitrogen loading increased plant N uptake 14–102\% in Red oak and 32–105\% in White oak under field conditions. Exponential N loading demonstrates potential as a viable technique to improve seedling outplanting performance and reclamation success in Indiana and elsewhere.},

	abstract = {Nitrogen fertilization in the nursery usually improves the transplanting performance of Mediterranean oaks. However, high N fertilization can reduce seedling stress tolerance, probably depending on the environmental conditions under which plants grow. We hypothesize that high N fertilization under mild fall conditions reduces cold and drought acclimation. To assess this hypothesis, we studied if fall temperature differences among cultivation locations influence the effect of N fertilization regime on cold and drought tolerance, N status and growth in the evergreen Mediterranean oak Quercus ilex subsp. ballota (Desf.) Samp. Plants were cultivated in two nurseries of distinct fall temperature conditions (mild and cold fall nurseries) under four fertilization regimes: Low and high N at constant rate (total N, 33 and 175mgseedling−1), high N at exponential rate (175mgNseedling−1) and fall N loading (89mgNseedling−1). Seedling water relations, survival to a −12°C frost and leaf soluble carbohydrates concentration were assessed three times in the fall, and shoot elongation was measured weekly through the fall. Moreover, seedling mass and N concentration were measured at the end of the fall. Fall loaded seedlings had the highest tissue N concentration, while seedling mass was highest in the high N constant and exponential fertilization regimes. Seedlings at the cold fall nursery concentrated more N but were smaller than seedlings at the mild fall nursery. Cessation of shoot elongation in the mild fall nursery occurred 1month later than in the cold location and high N exponentially-fertilized plants ceased shoot elongation later than the rest of fertilization treatments. Seedlings at the mild fall location had lower drought and cold tolerance than plants at the cold fall site. At mid fall, exponential fertilization at the mild nursery reduced seedling frost and drought tolerance, but treatment differences vanished at the end of the fall. In contrast, fertilization regime did not affect either cold or drought tolerance of seedlings at the cold fall nursery. Across dates and nurseries, frost survival was positively related to leaf soluble carbohydrates concentration and dry weight fraction. Beside, degree of cold acclimation decreased with shoot elongation cessation date and increased with leaf soluble carbohydrates concentration, suggesting a link between shoot growth activity, soluble carbohydrates, and frost tolerance. We conclude that Q. ilex subsp. ballota hardening is reduced by high N exponential fertilization mainly under mild fall conditions, while fall loading and constant low N fertilization did not affect hardening.},

Although mineral nutrition is a critical aspect of seedling quality, fertility targets of Mediterranean sclerophylous species have not been thoroughly quantiﬁed. We sought to deﬁne those fertility targets for seedlings of Quercus ilex, a key species in Mediterranean areas. Nine fertility treatments, ranging from 0 to 200 mg N seedling-1 applied under an exponential regime were tested in a greenhouse dose response trial in which phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) were increased in the same proportion as N (15N:5P:15K). Height and diameter growth were measured weekly, and biomass and nutritional status were analyzed at the end of culture (24 week). Plant growth and nutritional response to increased fertilization followed a curvilinear pattern depicting phases that ranged from deﬁciency to luxury consumption. Seedling dry mass production was maximized at 125 mg N seedling-1 (sufﬁciency level). N content and concentration increased with fertilization, reaching a maximum at 200 mg N seedling-1 (luxury consumption). P and K concentrations peaked at 75 and 25 mg N, respectively, suggesting a dilution effect of these nutrients. Root volume increased linearly up to 100 mg N and declined thereafter. The sufﬁciency level for Q. ilex (125 mg of applied N seedling-1) is notably higher than for other Quercus species from other biomes but intermediate to other Mediterranean Quercus species. No toxicity was observed at the highest treatment rate (200 mg N) suggesting that increased exponential N rates along with greater P and K proportions than those used in our experiment may further maximize nutrient storage.},

	abstract = {Nitrogen fertilization in the nursery usually improves the transplanting performance of Mediterranean oaks. However, high N fertilization can reduce seedling stress tolerance, probably depending on the environmental conditions under which plants grow. We hypothesize that high N fertilization under mild fall conditions reduces cold and drought acclimation. To assess this hypothesis, we studied if fall temperature differences among cultivation locations inﬂuence the effect of N fertilization regime on cold and drought tolerance, N status and growth in the evergreen Mediterranean oak Quercus ilex subsp. ballota (Desf.) Samp. Plants were cultivated in two nurseries of distinct fall temperature conditions (mild and cold fall nurseries) under four fertilization regimes: Low and high N at constant rate (total N, 33 and 175 mg seedlingÀ1), high N at exponential rate (175 mg N seedlingÀ1) and fall N loading (89 mg N seedlingÀ1). Seedling water relations, survival to a À12 °C frost and leaf soluble carbohydrates concentration were assessed three times in the fall, and shoot elongation was measured weekly through the fall. Moreover, seedling mass and N concentration were measured at the end of the fall. Fall loaded seedlings had the highest tissue N concentration, while seedling mass was highest in the high N constant and exponential fertilization regimes. Seedlings at the cold fall nursery concentrated more N but were smaller than seedlings at the mild fall nursery. Cessation of shoot elongation in the mild fall nursery occurred 1 month later than in the cold location and high N exponentially-fertilized plants ceased shoot elongation later than the rest of fertilization treatments. Seedlings at the mild fall location had lower drought and cold tolerance than plants at the cold fall site. At mid fall, exponential fertilization at the mild nursery reduced seedling frost and drought tolerance, but treatment differences vanished at the end of the fall. In contrast, fertilization regime did not affect either cold or drought tolerance of seedlings at the cold fall nursery. Across dates and nurseries, frost survival was positively related to leaf soluble carbohydrates concentration and dry weight fraction. Beside, degree of cold acclimation decreased with shoot elongation cessation date and increased with leaf soluble carbohydrates concentration, suggesting a link between shoot growth activity, soluble carbohydrates, and frost tolerance. We conclude that Q. ilex subsp. ballota hardening is reduced by high N exponential fertilization mainly under mild fall conditions, while fall loading and constant low N fertilization did not affect hardening.},

	abstract = {Forest plantations have been extensively used to combat desertiﬁcation. In drylands, harsh climate conditions and unfertile soils often preclude seedling establishment. The improvement in seedling quality by manipulating nutrient availability could contribute to increase planting success. However, morpho-functional traits deﬁning optimum seedling quality in drylands, and the fertilization schemes to achieve them, are still under discussion. Several studies suggest that well fertilized seedlings may perform better than nutrient limited seedlings in these environments. However, recent works have shown opposite results. In this review, we discuss the concept of seedling quality in drylands based on an evaluation of the effects of nutrient manipulation on seedling morpho-functional traits and ﬁeld performance. According to existing data, we hypothesize that nutrient-limited small seedlings may be better adapted to arid environments and unfavorable microsites, where access to water is uncertain and a conservative water use strategy may be advantageous. In contrast, in dry sub-humid areas, areas with deep soils, protected from excess radiation, and areas where irrigation is feasible, well-fertilized big seedlings with high root growth potential may have more chances of success. We discuss this theory in the context of the multiple objectives of dryland restoration and the environmental constrains posed by these areas, and identify knowledge gaps that should be targeted to test our hypothesis.},

We tested the efficacy of exponential nutrient application to load western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.) seedlings with nutrients to enhance field performance. Seedlings were grown with conventional, constant-rate fertilization (100 mg N·L–1) or with exponentially increasing fertilization at rates of 2\% and 3\% per day in a greenhouse. Growth and nutrient allocation were characterized. Seedlings from the three greenhouse treatments were then planted in an outdoor nursery experiment for 2 years with NPK fertilizer applied at 10, 25, or 100 mg N·L–1, and in a 3-year field experiment with and without slow-release fertilizer. Seedling height, biomass, and nutrient concentration did not differ greatly among exponential or constant-rate fertilization treatments in the greenhouse. The influence of postplanting fertility, both in the nursery and in the field, outweighed the effect of greenhouse exponential nutrient application. In the outdoor nursery, seedlings from all greenhouse treatments showed increased growth with higher rates of fertilization. In the field, there were no differences in growth among seedlings from the three greenhouse treatments, but fertilization at planting increased growth. The capacity for nutrient loading in container-grown western hemlock was likely exceeded because large quantities of N were applied in all treatments.},

For Pinus species seedlings, little information is known about the field performance of plants cultured with different nutrient rates, especially with exponential fertilization. In this study, Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis Carr.) seedlings grown in 187 ml containers were fertilized exponentially in 6 treatments ranging from 10 to 120 mg N seedling–1 for 25 weeks before outplanting. Dry mass and N content were measured at planting. Survival and field growth were monitored for two growing seasons. In the nursery, our data showed no difference in dry mass among the 40, 80, 100, and 120 mg N seedling–1 fertilizer treatments; collectively, these treatments were significantly greater than at 10 and 20 mg N seedling–1 treatments. Seedling N content was greatest for the 100 and 120 mg N seedling–1 rates. These data suggested that nursery optimum N fertilization rate was no less than 100 mg N seedling–1. Outplanting height and root-collar diameter growth characteristics were not significantly different after two years, whereas maximum mean survival was best for seedlings nursery-fertilized at 80 mg N seedling–1. In consideration of both nursery and field performance metrics, our data suggest that exponentially fertilizing Chinese pine seedlings at 80 mg N seedling–1 maximizes both nursery biomass accumulation and outplanting survival.},

	abstract = {Exponential fertilization during the pre-hardening stage and fall fertilization during the hardening stage have each been used independently to nutrient load seedlings. However, nursery and field responses of seedlings to the combination of exponential fertilization and fall fertilization have received little attention. Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis Car.) container seedlings were exponentially fertilized with accumulated totals of 40, 80 or 120 mg N per seedling during pre-hardening, and fall-fertilized with 0, 12, 24 or 48 mg N per seedling, and were subsequently outplanted and followed for two growing seasons. Interactions of exponential and fall fertilization had significant effects on plant N content in the nursery and first-year height after outplanting. Fall fertilization promoted additional nutrient loading during hardening for the 40-80 mg N per seedling pre-hardening regimes. The highest exponential fertilization rate enhanced N concentration in foliage and roots compared to the other two rates. Maximum diameter was observed in the lowest exponential fertilization rate at the second year after outplanting. Fall fertilization enhanced foliar N concentration. Supplemental 12 and 24 mg N per seedling during fall were more effective in increasing height increment at the second year after outplanting. Our results indicate that pre-hardening fertilization is a useful tool to nutrient load Chinese pine in the nursery and facilitate outplanting performance in the field. In combination, fall fertilization has potential to further augment this response, although further research is needed to precisely match rates of pre-hardening and fall fertilization to optimize seedling perfor mance.},

Previous studies have proven that combining pre-hardening fertilization (PF) with fall fertilization (FF) built seedling nutrient reserves more effectively; however, their effect on transplanting performance is poorly documented. We investigated the independent and interacting effects of 2 levels of PF and 4 levels of FF on seedling growth, nutrient acquisition and accumulation during different growth phases 1 year after transplanting of Quercus variabilis Blume in a nursery. High PF benefited nutrient reserves and subsequent transplanted seedling growth and tissue nutrient storage at the end of the rapid growth and hardening phases. Fall fertilization with 36 mg N increased stem dry mass and tissue nutrient content at the end of the hardening phase. At the conclusion of establishment, PF and FF showed a significant interaction for N and K uptake from soil. At the end of the rapid growth and hardening phases, high PF consistently increased nutrient uptake. Enhanced N and K uptake occurred following application of 36 mg N of FF at the end of the hardening phase. Distinct roles for PF and FF on 3 phases of transplanted seedlings demonstrated the necessity to evaluate fertilization in terms of nutrient reserves and subsequent transplanting performance in consecutive phases. Combining 100 mg N seedling–1 during pre-hardening with 36 mg N seedling–1 during fall yielded ideal transplanting performance for Quercus variabilis seedlings.},

	abstract = {Holm oak is the hardwood most used for reforestation in Mediterranean Spain, which makes the development of stock quality standards in order to improve establishment success, a priority. However, its nursery culture is characterized by a wide range of practices resulting in stock heterogeneity and a potentially varied outplanting performance. Previous research has focused on speciﬁc seedling quality attributes, obviating the integral effect of nursery culture on overall quality. We studied growing regime, seedling quality, and ﬁeld performance in nine holm oak stocklots produced in commercial nurseries during two consecutive growing years. Results proved variations in ﬁeld performance were related to stocklot quality and, hence, to the growing regime practised. This dependence on stock quality may vary with planting site weather: in the drier year, survival was related to attributes like height, water status and K concentration, while, in the second, milder year, only growth performance was related to nutrient concentrations, plant size and water status. Results indicated the following quality standards for height: 12–17 cm, diameter: 3.5–4.8 mm, shoot and root weights: 1.3–1.6 and 2.8–4.7 g, respectively, N–P–K foliar concentrations: over 10–0.9–3.7 mg g-1, respectively and in water status parameters: EMX {\textbackslash} 5 MPa and SWDTL [ 15\%. These attributes can be adjusted using nursery cultural practices in order to meet seedling quality standards for holm oak for planting across similar sites.},

This led us to study the eﬀect of three mineral nutrients (N, P and K) on both plant quality and frost tolerance. The experiment comprised eight growth treatments in which a high dose (H-) or a low dose (L-) of each nutrient was applied. Nitrogen was the nutrient that determined shoot growth, new root growth after transplanting (root egress), frost tolerance and ﬁeld performance. Performance was better with treatment H-N than with treatment L-N, leaf nitrogen contents being 1.53 and 0.89\% respectively. The eﬀects of phosphorus and potassium were not signiﬁcant between treatments for any parameter. The exception was P which, when interacting with N, favoured root egress for the H-N treatment.

	abstract = {Leafing-out of woody plants begins the growing season in temperate forests and is one of the most important drivers of ecosystem processes. There is substantial variation in the timing of leaf-out, both within and among species, but the leaf development of almost all temperate tree and shrub species is highly sensitive to temperature. As a result, leaf-out times of temperate forests are valuable for observing the effects of climate change. Analysis of phenology data from around the world indicates that leaf-out is generally earlier in warmer years than in cooler years and that the onset of leaf-out has advanced in many locations. Changes in the timing of leaf-out will affect carbon sequestration, plant–animal interactions, and other essential ecosystem processes. The development of remote sensing methods has expanded the scope of leaf-out monitoring from the level of an individual plant or forest to an entire region. Meanwhile, historical data have informed modeling and experimental studies addressing questions about leaf-out timing. For most species, onset of leaf-out will continue to advance, although advancement may be slowed for some species because of unmet chilling requirements. More information is needed to reduce the uncertainty in predicting the timing of future spring onset. Contents Summary 926 I. Introduction 927 II. What triggers a plant to leaf-out? 928 III.

	abstract = {Predicting forest responses to warming climates relies on assumptions about niche and temperature sensitivity that remain largely untested. Observational studies have related current and historical temperatures to phenological shifts, but experimental evidence is sparse, particularly for autumn responses. A 4 year field experiment exposed four deciduous forest species from contrasting climates (Liquidambar styraciflua, Quercus rubra, Populus grandidentata, and Betula alleghaniensis) to air temperatures 2 and 4 °C above ambient controls, using temperature-controlled open top chambers. Impacts of year-round warming on bud burst (BB), senescence, and abscission were evaluated in relation to thermal provenance. Leaves emerged earlier in all species by an average of 4–9 days at +2 °C and 6–14 days at +4 °C. Magnitude of advance varied with species and year, but was larger for the first 2 °C increment than for the second. Effect of warming increased with early BB, favoring Liquidambar, but even BB of northern species advanced, despite temperatures exceeding those of the realized niche. Treatment differences in BB were inadequately explained by temperature sums alone. In autumn, chlorophyll was retained an average of 4 and 7 days longer in +2 and +4 °C treatments, respectively, and abscission delayed by 8 and 13 days. Growing seasons in the warmer atmospheres averaged 5–18 days (E2) and 6–28 days (E4) longer, according to species, with the least impact in Quercus. Results are compared with a 16 years record of canopy onset and offset in a nearby upland deciduous forest, where BB showed similar responsiveness to spring temperatures (2–4 days °C−1). Offset dates in the stand tracked August–September temperatures, except when late summer drought caused premature senescence. The common garden-like experiment provides evidence that warming alone extends the growing season, at both ends, even if stand-level impacts may be complicated by variation in other environmental factors.},

	abstract = {Vegetation phenology is the study of recurring plant life cycle stages, seasonality which is linked to many ecosystem processes and is an important proxy of climate and environmental change. Remote sensing has been playing an important and increasing role in the monitoring and assessment of vegetation phenology. The aim of this review is to critically examine key studies related to remote sensing of vegetation phenology, with a special focus on temperate and boreal forests. Specifically, we focus on how the latest ground, near-surface and aerial data have been used to assess the satellite-derived Land Surface Phenology (LSP) metrics and the agreements that has been achieved in the last 15 years. Results demonstrated that the timing of satellite-derived LSP events can be detected, in the best-case scenarios, with a certainty of around half-week for spring metrics (e.g. Day of Year -DOY- of start of growing season) and around one week for autumn metrics (e.g. DOY of end of growing season). With expected shifts in plant phenology averaging {\textless}1 day per decade, such LSP uncertainties (in terms of absolute phenological dates) could greatly over- or under-estimate these species-level shifts; but the spatial variation in phenology can be consistently monitored. An increasing number of studies have investigated autumn phenology in the last decade, but autumn phenological dates continue to be more challenging to retrieve and interpret than spring dates. Emerging opportunities to further advance remote sensing of forest phenology is presented that includes synergetic use of multiple orbital sensors and its LSP evaluation with data from new sensors at a ground, near-surface and airborne level; yet traditional ground-based observations will continue to be highly useful to accurately record the timing of species-specific phenological events. This review might provide a guide for planning and managing remote sensing of forest phenology.},

However, in temperate and boreal latitudes, temperature is not the only cue used by trees to determine seasonality, as changes in photoperiod provide a more consistent, reliable annual signal of seasonality than temperature. Here, we discuss how day length may limit the ability of tree species to respond to climate warming in situ, focusing on the implications of photoperiodic sensing for extending the growing season and affecting plant phenology and growth, as well as the potential role of photoperiod in controlling carbon uptake and water fluxes in forests. We also review whether there are patterns across plant functional types (based on successional strategy, xylem anatomy and leaf morphology) in their sensitivity to photoperiod that we can use to predict which species or groups might be more successful in migrating as the climate warms, or may be more successfully used for forestry and agriculture through assisted migration schemes.},

	abstract = {Vegetation dynamics and phenology play an important role in inter-annual vegetation changes in terrestrial ecosystems and are key indicators of climate-vegetation interactions, land use/land cover changes and variation in year-to-year vegetation productivity. Satellite remote sensing data have been widely used for vegetation phenology monitoring over large geographic domains using various types of observations and methods over the past several decades. The goal of this paper is to present a detailed review of existing methods for phenology detection and emerging new techniques based on the analysis of time-series, multispectral remote sensing imagery. This paper summarizes the objective and applications of detecting general vegetation phenology stages (e.g., green onset, time or peak greenness and growing season length) often termed ‘land surface phenology’, as well as more advanced methods that estimate species-specific phenological stages (e.g., silking stage of maize). Common data processing methods, such as data smoothing, applied to prepare the time-series remote sensing observations to be applied to phenological detection methods are presented. Specific land surface phenology detection methods as well as species-specific phenology detection methods based on multispectral satellite data are then discussed. The impact of different error sources in the data on remote-sensing based phenology detection are also discussed in detail, as well as ways to reduce these uncertainties and errors. Joint analysis of multi-scale observations ranging from satellite to more recent ground-based sensors is helpful for us to understand satellite-based phenology detection mechanism and extent phenology detection to regional scale in the future. Finally, emerging opportunities to further advance remote sensing of phenology is presented that includes observations from Cubesats, near-surface observations such as PhenoCams and image data fusion techniques to improve the spatial resolution of time-series image data sets needed for phenological characterization.},

	abstract = {Vegetation phenology is considered an important biological indicator in understanding the behaviour of ecosystems and how it responds to environmental cues. Changes in vegetation dynamics have been strongly linked to the variability of climate patterns and may have an important impact on the ecological processes of ecosystems, such as the land surface-atmosphere exchange of water and carbon, energy flows and interaction between different species. Land surface phenology (LSP) is the study of seasonal patterns in plant phenophases based on time series from vegetation indices (VI) or biophysical variables derived from satellite data, and has played an essential role in monitoring the response of terrestrial ecosystems to environmental changes from local to global scales. The goal of this systematic literature review is to provide a detailed synthesis of the main contributions of the global LSP research to the development of environmental knowledge and remote sensing science and technology, identifying possible gaps that could be addressed in the coming years. This systematic review found that the number of LSP studies has grown exponentially since the 1980s, although the analysis of phenological metrics or phenometrics derived from satellite data (i.e. proxies for the biological phenophases of plants) has focused specifically on ecosystems located in the mid- and high-altitude in the Northern Hemisphere (e.g. boreal forest/taiga, evergreen, deciduous or mixed temperate forest). LSP studies use different satellite dataset and methods to estimate phenometrics. These studies identified an advance in spring and a delay in autumn phenophases as general trends. Although these trends were associated mainly to changes in temperature and precipitation, phenological cycle dynamics might be related to other drivers, such as photoperiod, soil moisture or organic carbon content, among others. Therefore, this interaction between different climatic and non-climatic drivers make phenology modelling a difficult task. Hence, in the coming years, a greater integration of LSP data into ecological process modelling could provide a more complete overview on the terrestrial ecosystems functioning. Furthermore, different technical and methodological aspects (e.g. greater temporal coverage of recent high-spatial-resolution satellites, advances in remote-sensing technology or improved efficiency in the computational processing of geospatial data) may also contribute to improve our understanding of Earth’s ecosystem dynamics and their environmental drivers.},

Shifts toward longer growing seasons, tracked by plant and animal species worldwide, heighten the need for this analysis. The concurrent availability of extensive citizen-science and long-term datasets has created tremendous opportunities to test the relationship between phenology and invasion. Here, we (1) extend major theories within community and invasion biology to include phenology, (2) develop a predictive framework to test these theories, and (3) outline available data resources to test predictions. By creating an integrated framework, we show how new analyses of long-term datasets could advance the fields of community ecology and invasion biology, while developing novel strategies for invasive species management.

Other factors, such as grazing and nitrogen deposition, also potentially influence phenological changes, but these relationships are poorly constrained. In manipulation experiments, grazing and nitrogen addition have no individual effects on most phenophase timings at the population level, but nitrogen addition markedly delays flowering. Additionally, there are carry-over effects between phenophases that control subsequent temperature and precipitation responses. Phenological changes in turn could alter species interactions, modulate carbon and water cycling, and affect Asian monsoons and spring rainfall over eastern China, but evidence of these interactions is limited. Harmonization of remote-sensing-based and in situ observations, and simultaneous testing of both biotic and abiotic factors, are needed for a mechanistic understanding of Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau phenology dynamics.},

	abstract = {Pollinator activity and competition for pollinators lead to quantitative and qualitative pollen limitations on seed production and affect the reproductive success of plant species, depending on their breeding system (e.g., self-compatibility and heterospeciﬁc compatibility) and genetic load (e.g., inbreeding depression and hybrid inviability). In alpine ecosystems, snowmelt regimes determine the distribution and phenology of plant communities. Plant species growing widely along a snowmelt gradient often grow with different species among local populations. Their pollinators also vary in their abundance, activity, and behavior during the season. These variations may modify plant–pollinator and plant–plant interactions. We integrated a series of our studies on the alpine dwarf shrub, Phyllodoce aleutica (Ericaceae), to elucidate the full set of intrinsic (species-speciﬁc breeding system) and extrinsic factors (snow condition, pollinator activity, and interspeciﬁc competition) acting on their reproductive process. Seasonality of pollinator activity led to quantitative pollen limitation in the early-blooming populations, whereas in the late-blooming populations, high pollinator activity ensured pollination service, but interspeciﬁc competition for pollinators led to qualitative and quantitative pollen limitation in less competitive species. However, negative effects of illegitimate pollen receipt on seedset success might be reduced when cryptic incompatibility systems (i.e., outcross pollen grains took priority over self- and heterospeciﬁc pollen grains) could effectively prevent ovule and seed discounting. Our studies highlight the importance of species-speciﬁc responses of plant reproduction to changing pollinator availability along environmental gradients to understand the general features of pollination networks in alpine ecosystems.},

However, in temperate and boreal latitudes, temperature is not the only cue used by trees to determine seasonality, as changes in photoperiod provide a more consistent, reliable annual signal of seasonality than temperature. Here, we discuss how day length may limit the ability of tree species to respond to climate warming in situ, focusing on the implications of photoperiodic sensing for extending the growing season and affecting plant phenology and growth, as well as the potential role of photoperiod in controlling carbon uptake and water fluxes in forests. We also review whether there are patterns across plant functional types (based on successional strategy, xylem anatomy and leaf morphology) in their sensitivity to photoperiod that we can use to predict which species or groups might be more successful in migrating as the climate warms, or may be more successfully used for forestry and agriculture through assisted migration schemes.},

During the last three decades, the thermal potential growing season has lengthened by about 10.5 days (P {\textless} 0.01, 1982–2011), which is unprecedented in the context of the past 60 years. The overall lengthening has been stronger and more significant in Eurasia (12.6 days, P {\textless} 0.01) than North America (6.2 days, P {\textgreater} 0.05). The photosynthetic growing season has closely tracked the pace of warming and extension of the potential growing season in spring, but not in autumn when factors such as light and moisture limitation may constrain photosynthesis. The autumnal extension of the photosynthetic growing season since 1982 appears to be about half that of the thermal potential growing season, yielding a smaller lengthening of the photosynthetic growing season (6.7 days at the circumpolar scale, P {\textless} 0.01). Nevertheless, when integrated over the growing season, photosynthetic activity has closely followed the interannual variations and warming trend in cumulative growing season temperatures. This lengthening and intensification of the photosynthetic growing season, manifested principally over Eurasia rather than North America, is associated with a long-term increase (22.2\% since 1972, P {\textless} 0.01) in the amplitude of the CO2 annual cycle at northern latitudes. The springtime extension of the photosynthetic and potential growing seasons has apparently stimulated earlier and stronger net CO2 uptake by northern ecosystems, while the autumnal extension is associated with an earlier net release of CO2 to the atmosphere. These contrasting responses may be critical in determining the impact of continued warming on northern terrestrial ecosystems and the carbon cycle.},

As in other ecosystems, the resulting changes in phenology are not uniform among species, creating the potential for altered and new interspecific interactions. New plant and animal species are arriving as lower altitude species move up with warming temperatures, introducing new competitors and generating changes in plant–pollinator interactions.

In addition, the potentiality of remote sensing technologies has largely contributed to the growth and complexity of this discipline, in terms of the scale of analysis, techniques of data processing, and a variety of topics. As a consequence, it is increasingly difficult for scientists to get a clear picture of remotely sensed phenology (rs+pheno) research. Bibliometric analysis is increasingly used for the study of a discipline and its conceptual dynamics. This review analyzed the last 40 years (1979–2018) of publications in the rs+pheno field retrieved from the Scopus database; such publications were investigated by means of a text mining approach, both in terms of bibliographic and text data. Results demonstrated that rs+pheno research is exponentially growing through time; however, it is primarily considered a subset of remote sensing science rather than a branch of phenology. In this framework, in the last decade, agriculture is becoming more and more a standalone science in rs+pheno research, independently from other related topics, e.g., classification. On the contrary, forestry struggles to gain its thematic role in rs+pheno studies and remains strictly connected with climate change issues. Classification and mapping represent the major rs+pheno topic, together with the extraction and the analysis of phenological metrics, like the start of the growing season. To the contrary, forest ecophysiology, in terms of ecosystem respiration and net ecosystem exchange, results as the most relevant new topic, together with the use of the red edge band and SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data in rs+pheno agricultural studies. Some niche emerging rs+pheno topics may be recognized in the ocean and arctic investigations linked to phytoplankton blooming and ice cover dynamics. The findings of this study might be applicable for planning and managing remotely sensed phenology research; scientists involved in such discipline might use this study as a reference to consider their research domain in a broader dynamical network.},

Much of this research has focused on phenology – the timing of life-history events.

Here, we outline how merging approaches from ecology, climate science and evolutionary biology can advance research on phenological responses to climate variability. Using insight into seasonal and interannual climate variability combined with niche theory and community phylogenetics, we develop a predictive approach for species’ reponses to changing climate. Our approach predicts that species occupying higher latitudes or the early growing season should be most sensitive to climate and have the most phylogenetically conserved phenologies. We further predict that temperate species will respond to climate change by shifting in time, while tropical species will respond by shifting space, or by evolving. Although we focus here on plant phenology, our approach is broadly applicable to ecological research of plant responses to climate variability.},

Data on shifting phenologies with warming have accumulated rapidly, yet research has been comparatively slow to explain the diversity of phenological responses observed across latitudes, growing seasons and species. Here, we outline recent efforts to synthesize perspectives on plant phenology across the fields of ecology, climate science and evolution. We highlight three major axes that vary among these disciplines: relative focus on abiotic versus biotic drivers of phenology, on plastic versus genetic drivers of intraspecific variation, and on cross-species versus autecological approaches. Recent interdisciplinary efforts, building on data covering diverse species and climate space, have found a greater role of temperature in controlling phenology at higher latitudes and for early-flowering species in temperate systems. These efforts have also made progress in understanding the tremendous diversity of responses across species by incorporating evolutionary relatedness, and linking phenological flexibility to invasions and plant performance. Future research with a focus on data collection in areas outside the temperate mid-latitudes and across species' ranges, alongside better integration of how risk and investment shape plant phenology, offers promise for further progress.},

In the continental United States, the timing of the onset of greenness in the spring (leaf expansion, grass green-up) and offset of greenness in the fall (leaf abscission, cessation of height growth, grass brown-off) are strongly influenced by meteorological and climatological conditions. We developed predictive phenology models based on traditional phenology research using commonly available meteorological and climatological data. Predictions were compared with satellite phenology observations at numerous 20 km × 20 km contiguous landcover sites. Onset mean absolute error was 7.2 days in the deciduous broadleaf forest (DBF) biome and 6.1 days in the grassland biome. Offset mean absolute error was 5.3 days in the DBF biome and 6.3 days in the grassland biome. Maximum expected errors at a 95\% probability level ranged from 10 to 14 days. Onset was strongly associated with temperature summations in both grassland and DBF biomes; DBF offset was best predicted with a photoperiod function, while grassland offset required a combination of precipitation and temperature controls. A long-term regional test of the DBF onset model captured field-measured interannual variability trends in lilac phenology. Continental application of the phenology models for 1990–1992 revealed extensive interannual variability in onset and offset. Median continental growing season length ranged from a low of 129 days in 1991 to a high of 146 days in 1992. Potential uses of the models include regulation of the timing and length of the growing season in large-scale biogeochemical models and monitoring vegetation response to interannual climatic variability.},

	abstract = {An increasing number of studies have reported on shifts in timing and length of the growing season, based on phenological, satellite and climatological studies. The evidence points to a lengthening of the growing season of ca. 10–20 days in the last few decades, where an earlier onset of the start is most prominent. This extension of the growing season has been associated with recent global warming. Changes in the timing and length of the growing season (GSL) may not only have far reaching consequences for plant and animal ecosystems, but persistent increases in GSL may lead to long-term increases in carbon storage and changes in vegetation cover which may affect the climate system.

	abstract = {Predicting forest responses to warming climates relies on assumptions about niche and temperature sensitivity that remain largely untested. Observational studies have related current and historical temperatures to phenological shifts, but experimental evidence is sparse, particularly for autumn responses. A 4 year ﬁeld experiment exposed four deciduous forest species from contrasting climates (Liquidambar styraciﬂua, Quercus rubra, Populus grandidentata, and Betula alleghaniensis) to air temperatures 2 and 4 °C above ambient controls, using temperature-controlled open top chambers. Impacts of year-round warming on bud burst (BB), senescence, and abscission were evaluated in relation to thermal provenance. Leaves emerged earlier in all species by an average of 4–9 days at +2 °C and 6–14 days at +4 °C. Magnitude of advance varied with species and year, but was larger for the ﬁrst 2 °C increment than for the second. Effect of warming increased with early BB, favoring Liquidambar, but even BB of northern species advanced, despite temperatures exceeding those of the realized niche. Treatment differences in BB were inadequately explained by temperature sums alone. In autumn, chlorophyll was retained an average of 4 and 7 days longer in +2 and +4 °C treatments, respectively, and abscission delayed by 8 and 13 days. Growing seasons in the warmer atmospheres averaged 5–18 days (E2) and 6–28 days (E4) longer, according to species, with the least impact in Quercus. Results are compared with a 16 years record of canopy onset and offset in a nearby upland deciduous forest, where BB showed similar responsiveness to spring temperatures (2–4 days °CÀ1). Offset dates in the stand tracked August–September temperatures, except when late summer drought caused premature senescence. The common garden-like experiment provides evidence that warming alone extends the growing season, at both ends, even if stand-level impacts may be complicated by variation in other environmental factors.},

	abstract = {In recent years, research in invasion biology has focused increasing attention on understanding the role of phenology in shaping plant invasions. Multiple studies have found non-native species that tend to ﬂower distinctly early or late in the growing season, advance more with warming or have shifted earlier with climate change compared with native species. This growing body of literature has focused on patterns of phenological differences, but there is a need now for mechanistic studies of how phenology contributes to invasions. To do this, however, requires understanding how phenology ﬁts within complex functional trait relationships. Towards this goal, we review recent literature linking phenology with other functional traits, and discuss the role of phenology in mediating how plants experience disturbance and stress—via climate, herbivory and competition—across the growing season. Because climate change may alter the timing and severity of stress and disturbance in many systems, it could provide novel opportunities for invasion—depending upon the dominant climate controller of the system, the projected climate change, and the traits of native and non-native species. Based on our current understanding of plant phenological and growth strategies—especially rapid growing, early-ﬂowering species versus later-ﬂowering species that make slower-return investments in growth—we project optimal periods for invasions across three distinct systems under current climate change scenarios. Research on plant invasions and phenology within this predictive framework would provide a more rigorous test of what drives invader success, while at the same time testing basic plant ecological theory. Additionally, extensions could provide the basis to model how ecosystem processes may shift in the future with continued climate change.},

	abstract = {Trees inhabiting seasonal climates organize their life cycle activities following an internal program termed phenology. The rising temperature through global warming has substantially influenced the timing of these phenological events, most prominently studied through the advancement of leaf emergence. Moreover, changes in precipitation patterns have led to severe drought events that have increased in both intensity and frequency worldwide. Both trends necessitate trees to adjust and synchronize their annual cycle within the \&\#8216;window of opportunity\&\#8217; presenting itself based on favourable temperature and available soil moisture. Depending on when critical water limitations occur, tree species are affected at different developmental stages throughout their seasonal cycle. Thus, the severity of impact at a given stage and/or the flexibility to shift developmental and growth activities determine whether the same stressor results in mortality or minor growth reductions.
We used over 1000 saplings of six North American tree species (Sequoia sempervirens, Pinus contorta, Quercus garryana, Betula papyrifera, Prunus virginiata, and Acer macrophyllum) to investigate how flexibly (or conservatively) trees re-arrange (or stick to) their phenological sequence and growth activities when impacted by a) drought or b) defoliation events. Both treatments were applied separately at three different times (after leaf emergence, at the summer solstice, and in August) on different batches of saplings. The saplings were grown in a Polytunnel in Vancouver, BC, Canada without water limitations (except for the periodic drought treatments) and were equipped with magnetic dendrometers to monitor radial growth along with observations of bud development and shoot elongation. After harvest, we assessed total root and shoot biomass. In addition, through an image analysis of micro stem slices (utilizing a microtome), we were able to review the xylem properties (e.g., the number of cells produced, vessel size) of treated and control saplings.
Our findings reveal how artificial downregulation of source and sink activities at different points in the growing season impacts the performance of radial and apical meristems. Furthermore, we identify the potential of temperate tree species to cope with environmental stressors by optimally utilizing the available \&\#8216;time window of opportunity\&\#8217;\&\#8212;for instance, by shifting or splitting their phenological development and growth activity around a drought period. Finally, we discuss how these characteristics correlate with a species\&\#8217; strategy and the level of bud determinism, i.e., whether shoots continue to grow later in the season (neo-growth atop pre-formed tissue).},

                  Phenological shifts in response to changing climatic conditions is a key acclimation process for the persistence of perennial plants in temperate and boreal climates. The optimal time to leaf‐out is the result of an evolutionary process determined by the trade‐off between minimizing the risk of freezing damages and herbivory pressure while maximizing resource uptake to increase competitiveness against the other plants.
                
                
                  We quantified the penalty exerted by frost damage at the time of leaf emergence on plant development (reduction in leaf area, canopy duration and growth) over the potential gains without frost (increased biomass and non‐structural carbohydrate reserves), depending on when leaf‐out occurs. To this purpose, we exposed 960 saplings of four temperate deciduous tree species with contrasting cold hardiness to two frost intensities shortly after leaf emergence, which was artificially induced at four occasions to reflect the whole range of natural leaf‐out dates.
                
                
                  
                    One year above‐ground biomass (AGB) increments following the frost revealed a clear ranking among the species depending on their strategy to cope with damaging frosts.
                    Prunus avium
                    (−41\% of AGB‐increment compared to control saplings) resprouted from the stem base,
                    Quercus robur
                    (−62\%) rapidly produced new leaves from dormant reserve buds,
                    Fagus sylvatica
                    (−98\%) showed highest chlorophyll content in autumn and delayed senescence together with
                    Carpinus betulus
                    (−105\%), which overcompensated NSC reserves after the growing season but showed highest mortality (up to 32\%). In all species, NSC reserves recovered rapidly to control levels at the expense of growth.
                  
                
                
                  The timing of leaf‐out (advanced and delayed artificially) significantly affected the performance and recovery (regreening and growth) of both frozen and non‐frozen saplings, with the lowest performance found at the most delayed leaf‐out date. We propose that the potential to recover from frost damages is an important component of a tree's performance, particularly at the juvenile stage. The ability to recover may become even more decisive in the future with the predicted increase of false springs in many extratropical regions.

	abstract = {The aim of our study was to investigate the response in timing of phenological events and the duration of the growing season to climate warming for three deciduous tree species: birch, lime, and maple. The most significant advancement in phenological spring (leaf unfolding) – 14.3 days through the investigated 19562009 period – was detected in the case of the early-season pioneer species birch. A shift in leaf unfolding for other two late season species, maple and lime, was less expressed and consisted of 9 days through the investigated period. The changes in timing of phenological autumn were detected to be even more species specific and it was delayed by almost 16 days for maple, 12 days for lime and, in contrast, leaf fall advanced by 12 days was detected for birch. The occurrence of leaf unfolding best correlated with March and April temperatures. A statistically significant correlation of leaf unfolding with January temperatures was characteristic of early-season species – birch. The relationship between timing in leaf fall and temperature was much weaker and in most cases statistically insignificant. The growing season for maple and lime was extended by 25.4 and 21.5 days, respectively, through the study period. The length of the growing season of birch did not experience any statistically significant changes and the entire growing period shifted earlier by almost two weeks during the investigated period.},

	abstract = {Predicting forest responses to warming climates relies on assumptions about niche and temperature sensitivity that remain largely untested. Observational studies have related current and historical temperatures to phenological shifts, but experimental evidence is sparse, particularly for autumn responses. A 4 year ﬁeld experiment exposed four deciduous forest species from contrasting climates (Liquidambar styraciﬂua, Quercus rubra, Populus grandidentata, and Betula alleghaniensis) to air temperatures 2 and 4 °C above ambient controls, using temperature-controlled open top chambers. Impacts of year-round warming on bud burst (BB), senescence, and abscission were evaluated in relation to thermal provenance. Leaves emerged earlier in all species by an average of 4–9 days at +2 °C and 6–14 days at +4 °C. Magnitude of advance varied with species and year, but was larger for the ﬁrst 2 °C increment than for the second. Effect of warming increased with early BB, favoring Liquidambar, but even BB of northern species advanced, despite temperatures exceeding those of the realized niche. Treatment differences in BB were inadequately explained by temperature sums alone. In autumn, chlorophyll was retained an average of 4 and 7 days longer in +2 and +4 °C treatments, respectively, and abscission delayed by 8 and 13 days. Growing seasons in the warmer atmospheres averaged 5–18 days (E2) and 6–28 days (E4) longer, according to species, with the least impact in Quercus. Results are compared with a 16 years record of canopy onset and offset in a nearby upland deciduous forest, where BB showed similar responsiveness to spring temperatures (2–4 days °CÀ1). Offset dates in the stand tracked August–September temperatures, except when late summer drought caused premature senescence. The common garden-like experiment provides evidence that warming alone extends the growing season, at both ends, even if stand-level impacts may be complicated by variation in other environmental factors.},

                  Earlier leaf‐out and later autumn leaf senescence under climate warming have been linked to increases in plant productivity and ecosystem carbon uptake. Yet, despite the potential implications of shifting phenology for plant carbon uptake, the degree to which phenological changes affect overall plant growth and the partitioning between above‐ and below‐ground biomass remains unclear.
                
                
                  
                    Here we use a 3‐year experiment to quantify changes in root and shoot growth of three woody plant species (two common European tree species,
                    Fagus sylvatica
                    and
                    Quercus robur
                    , and one shrub
                    Lonicera xylosteum
                    ) under spring and autumn warming.
                  
                
                
                  
                    In both tree species, the magnitude—and in
                    Quercus
                    even the direction—of the effects of growing‐season length on growth depends on whether the warming happened in spring or in autumn. Each day earlier leaf‐out in response to warming resulted in total biomass increases of 0.8\%–2.5\%, whereas delayed senescence led to reductions of 0.2\%–2.1\%. Advances in leaf‐out also led to increased root‐to‐shoot biomass ratios because root growth was proportionally more stimulated than shoot growth. In the shrub species, earlier leaf‐out had no effect, while delayed senescence led to increases in root, but not shoot, biomass.
                  
                
                
                  
                    Synthesis
                    . The strong asymmetry between growth responses to spring versus autumn phenology demonstrates that growing‐season length per se is a weak indicator of individual‐level tree productivity. The results further imply that phenological shifts are reshaping the functional balance between above‐ and below‐ground growth, which is critical for quantifying forest carbon dynamics under climate change.},

The population was sampled in 2014 for seedling and sapling stages (≤6 cm in stem diameter) to obtain an age frequency distribution spanning about 80 y and including survivors of seed cohorts produced in two known mast years at the study site (2013 and 1984) and in other mast years known to have occurred within the broader region (but not confirmed for the study site). The age frequency distribution is roughly bimodal with zero to very few individuals recorded for ages 9 through 29 y, corresponding with the known time period (early 1980's to late 2000's) of regional overabundance for white-tailed deer in eastern Ontario and at the study site in particular. The 1 y old seedlings (from the 2013 mast year) and the survivors of putative mast year cohorts from 2006 and 2000, however, are especially conspicuous, with less striking recruitment success indicated for the older confirmed mast year cohort from 1984 (which had more years of accumulated impact from mortality risks). Our results suggest seed masting in sugar maple can bolster cohort recruitment success that otherwise would virtually (or completely) fail when severe impact from deer browsing is combined with other typical early life-stage mortality risks, e.g., from drought, neighborhood competition, and persistent overhead canopy shade.},

Some of these hypotheses deal with the proximate causes of masting (e.g. the climate hypothesis) but others are concerned mostly with ultimate, evolutionary explanations (e.g. the pollination efficiency hypothesis). 2 The seed production of three tree species, Abies balsamea, Acer saccharum and Betula alleghaniensis, was followed over a 7-year period in an old-growth, cold temperate forest of north-eastern North America. The main objectives were to determine the extent of interannual variations in seed production, to investigate the relationship between viable and potential seed crop and crop efficiency, and to explore the effects of climate on seed production. 3 Potential and viable seed production varied significantly among years for all three species. However, the timing of dispersal remained the same regardless of the level of seed production. 4 Seed rain was spatially less heterogeneous in years of high seed production, suggesting that most trees were reproducing in such years. 5 Over the 7-year period, there was a significant concordance among species in their viable seed crop and crop efficiency, but not in their potential seed crop. Crop efficiency was positively correlated to potential seed crop for Abies and Betula, but not for Acer. 6 High seed production was related to warm, dry conditions in the spring of the previous year (i.e. at reproductive bud initiation) but to a moist summer in the year of seed maturation. 7 Masting in these three species thus appears to be controlled by several factors, including climate and pollination efficiency.},

	abstract = {In many forests, advance regeneration represents an important ‘seedling bank’ for replacing overstory trees after canopy disturbance. However, long-term spatial and temporal dynamics of understory tree seedlings are poorly understood, particularly in topographically complex southern New England mixed-deciduous forests. From 1996 to 2005 we tracked the recruitment, growth and survival of seedlings of masting tree species across different topographic positions. Species included the largely valley associated sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and white ash (Fraxinus americana), the primarily ridge associated white oaks (Quercus alba and Q. prinus), and the site generalist red oaks (Q. rubra and Q. velutina) and red maple (A. rubrum). Four 1m2 circular plots were randomly established in nine different sites, which included three replicates of each topographic position (ridge, midslope and valley). Seedling recruits were tagged and measured annually. Densities varied largely between species, both over time and by topographic position. Ridge and midslope positions had similar patterns, with high densities of red oak ({\textgreater}200,000seedlings/ha) declining over time, and other species generally fluctuating at much lower densities ({\textless}10,000seedlings/ha). Trends differed in the valley, where higher white ash and sugar maple densities resulted in overlap with red oak. Overall declines in density were largely driven by a lack of significant recruitment events of red oak during the study, suggesting that seedling dynamics are driven by longer (decadal) cycles, likely reflecting the interaction of temporal variation in masting and conditions for establishment. Total recruitment for all species was positively related to overstory composition, as expected given topographic associations between species. Survival varied between species, but differed among topographic positions. White ash and sugar maple had relatively low survival in midslope and ridge positions relative to the red and white oaks, but higher survival than red oaks in valleys. Red maple had low overall survival, and only persisted beyond age 10 in the midslope position. Seedling heights generally increased with age for all species, but growth was slow, and many seedlings exhibited dieback. These survival patterns likely reflect effects of light limitation (in the valley) and moisture limitation (in the ridge) associated with topographic position. Overall, while seed inputs likely vary topographically related to differences in overstory abundance, differences in survival clearly reinforce these distributional patterns. In management terms, these survival patterns have significant site-specific implications for the type and timing of silvicultural interventions aimed at stand regeneration, particularly given infrequent events of seedling recruitment.},

We found clear evidence of masting in these species, and mast years were often coincident in the two species; masting was best predicted by Delta T or Delta T plus previous-year seedfall. We saw no evidence for correspondence of masting in these trees to precipitation cues. A soil calcium addition modified elevation effects on seed production.

	abstract = {Life-history theory predicts that reproductive allocation should increase with age and size once plants reach reproductive maturity. This suggests that there may also be a subsequent decline in somatic growth as plants become larger or older. However, few studies have examined how the relationship between branch extension growth and reproduction varies with size or age in the longest-lived plants: trees. Using a mobile lift for canopy access, we retrospectively measured branch extension growth before, during and after two (between 2011 and 2013) Acer saccharum mast events (the synchronous production of many seeds at long intervals), quantifying seed production per internode and internode length. Branch extension was reduced by 24 and 36\%, respectively, in 2011 and 2013 relative to non-mast years, consistent with the expectation that increased reproductive allocation comes at the cost of allocation to growth. Internode length decreased from 8 to 3 cm year(-1) as seed production increased from zero to 17 seeds year(-1); a similar decrease was observed at the whole-tree level using average internode extension rates and seed production per tree. Seed production alone was the most parsimonious predictor of branch extension growth, with no independent effect of tree size, suggesting that it is the increase in reproductive allocation, rather than an increase in tree size per se, that drives the decline in branch extension rates. The slope of the relationship between branch extension and reproduction did not vary with tree size, suggesting that there was no increase in the somatic cost of reproduction with tree size. We also found no evidence for lag effects of reproduction on extension growth in subsequent years. Overall, these results suggest that reproductive allocation assessed at the shoot level increases with tree size and is a major driver of the ontogenetic decline in branch extension growth.},

	abstract = {Questions Mast seeding, i.e. synchronous highly variable seed production among years, occurs in many perennial plant species and across diverse plant communities. Two predominant hypotheses for mast seeding are pollination efficiency and predator satiation, with weather conditions as a proximate cause. Little consensus has been achieved regarding the relative impacts of ultimate selection and proximate weather on variation in seed production. Moreover, mast-seeding studies often focus on a single species or phylogenetically closely related species, while studies on plant communities consisting of tree species with a diversity of reproductive strategies are less common. Location A 25-ha Changbaishan temperate forest dynamic plot, northeast China. Methods We used 8 yr of seed rain data to characterize patterns and evaluate underlying selective drivers of mast seeding. We employed generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs) to analyse the relationships between inter-annual variability of mast seeding and weather conditions. Results All 20 species in this forest community exhibited high variability in annual seed production, but the magnitude of seed production among species was generally asynchronous across years. Wind-pollinated species had higher inter-annual variation of seed production than animal-pollinated species, while species dispersed by seed predators and abiotic modes (e.g. wind and gravity) showed little variation. Species responded individually to weather conditions for both temperature and precipitation, and spring phenology in the same year as seed production had a larger effect among species than both the weather conditions of the same summer and season-long lags. Conclusions Our findings suggest that pollination efficiency hypothesis had a much stronger effect than predation satiation hypothesis on mast seeding, and weather conditions demonstrated the proximate role of weather drivers in producing the community-wide mast-seeding pattern. We emphasize the need to simultaneously assess drivers of mast seeding for multiple species within a plant community.},

	abstract = {1 Two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses have been proposed to explain the evolutionary advantages of mast seeding (the intermittent production of large crops of flowers or seeds by a population of perennial plants). Mast seeding could have evolved as a result of increased pollination efficiency in mast-flowering years and/or as an anti-predator adaptation that increases the survival of seeds by alternately starving seed predators in non-mast years and satiating them in mast years. 2 We investigated annual seed crops to test the relative contributions of pollination efficiency and pre-dispersal predator satiation to mast seeding in Fagus crenata, a tall tree species dominating cool-temperate forests in Japan. Thirteen-year (1990–2002) time series data were collected for five beech forests in south-western Hokkaido. 3 The negative relationship observed between the pollination failure rate and the total seed crop in the current year supports the pollination efficiency hypothesis. The predator satiation hypothesis was also supported by the fact that the predation rate showed a good fit to the ratio of successive total seed crops, suggesting that a numerical response (starving the predator in low seed years) operated in F. crenata. 4 Key-factor analysis revealed that pre-dispersal seed predation had a larger effect on seed production per flower than did pollination efficiency. 5 We used a simulation model to examine how the magnitude of fluctuation in the total seed crop would influence the pollination failure rate, the predation rate and the viable seed rate. The mean levels of fluctuation of total seed crops of F. crenata were just large enough to provide maximum benefits from predator satiation at some sites. 6 Mast seeding in F. crenata thus appears to be determined by selective pressures from its seed predators.},

Here, I provide a brief history of masting research, highlighting some of the early contributions by foresters, zoologists and others that paved the way for the burgeoning number of studies currently being conducted by researchers around the world. Of particular current interest is work attempting to understand the proximate mechanisms, evolutionary drivers and community effects of this important ecological phenomenon as well as the ways that climate change may influence masting behaviour in the future.

	abstract = {Key message Climate factors affect seed biomass production which in turn influences autumn wild boar spatial behaviour. Adaptive management strategies require an understanding of both masting and its influence on the behaviour of pulsed resource consumers like wild boar. Context Pulsed resources ecosystem could be strongly affected by climate. Disantangling the role of climate on mast seeding allow to understand a seed consumer spatial behaviour to design proper wildlife and forest management strategies. Aims We investigated the relationship between mast seeding and climatic variables and we evaluated the influence of mast seeding on wild boar home range dynamics. Methods We analysed mast seeding as seed biomass production of three broadleaf tree species (Fagus sylvatica L., Quercus cerris L., Castanea sativa Mill.) in the northern Apennines. Next, we explored which climatic variables affected tree masting patterns and finally we tested the effect of both climate and seed biomass production on wild boar home range size. Results Seed biomass production is partially regulated by climate; high precipitation in spring of the current year positively affects seed biomass production while summer precipitation of previous year has an opposite effect. Wild boar home range size is negatively correlated to seed biomass production, and the climate only partially contributes to determine wild boar spatial behaviour. Conclusion Climate factors influence mast seeding, and the negative correlation between wild boar home range and mast seeding should be taken into account for designing integrated, proactive hunting management.},

	abstract = {Climate change is reshaping global vegetation through its impacts on plant mortality, but recruitment creates the next generation of plants and will determine the structure and composition of future communities. Recruitment depends on mean seed production, but also on the interannual variability and among-plant synchrony in seed production, the phenomenon known as mast seeding. Thus, predicting the long-term response of global vegetation dynamics to climate change requires understanding the response of masting to changing climate. Recently, data and methods have become available allowing the first assessments of long-term changes in masting. Reviewing the literature, we evaluate evidence for a fingerprint of climate change on mast seeding and discuss the drivers and impacts of these changes. We divide our discussion into the main characteristics of mast seeding: interannual variation, synchrony, temporal autocorrelation and mast frequency. Data indicate that masting patterns are changing but the direction of that change varies, likely reflecting the diversity of proximate factors underlying masting across taxa. Experiments to understand the proximate mechanisms underlying masting, in combination with the analysis of long-term datasets, will enable us to understand this observed variability in the response of masting. This will allow us to predict future shifts in masting patterns, and consequently ecosystem impacts of climate change via its impacts on masting.

            Alpine environments are among the habitats most strongly affected by climate change, and consequently their unique plants and pollinators are faced with the challenge of adapting or going extinct. Changes in temperature and precipitation affect snowpack and snowmelt, resulting in changes in the growing season in this environment where plant growth and pollinator activity are constrained to the snow‐free season, which can vary significantly across the landscape if there is significant topographic complexity. As in other ecosystems, the resulting changes in phenology are not uniform among species, creating the potential for altered and new interspecific interactions. New plant and animal species are arriving as lower altitude species move up with warming temperatures, introducing new competitors and generating changes in plant–pollinator interactions. Repeating historical surveys, taking advantage of museum collections, and using new technology will facilitate our understanding of how plants and pollinators are responding to the changing alpine environment.},

	abstract = {Predicting forest responses to warming climates relies on assumptions about niche and temperature sensitivity that remain largely untested. Observational studies have related current and historical temperatures to phenological shifts, but experimental evidence is sparse, particularly for autumn responses. A 4 year ﬁeld experiment exposed four deciduous forest species from contrasting climates (Liquidambar styraciﬂua, Quercus rubra, Populus grandidentata, and Betula alleghaniensis) to air temperatures 2 and 4 °C above ambient controls, using temperature-controlled open top chambers. Impacts of year-round warming on bud burst (BB), senescence, and abscission were evaluated in relation to thermal provenance. Leaves emerged earlier in all species by an average of 4–9 days at +2 °C and 6–14 days at +4 °C. Magnitude of advance varied with species and year, but was larger for the ﬁrst 2 °C increment than for the second. Effect of warming increased with early BB, favoring Liquidambar, but even BB of northern species advanced, despite temperatures exceeding those of the realized niche. Treatment differences in BB were inadequately explained by temperature sums alone. In autumn, chlorophyll was retained an average of 4 and 7 days longer in +2 and +4 °C treatments, respectively, and abscission delayed by 8 and 13 days. Growing seasons in the warmer atmospheres averaged 5–18 days (E2) and 6–28 days (E4) longer, according to species, with the least impact in Quercus. Results are compared with a 16 years record of canopy onset and offset in a nearby upland deciduous forest, where BB showed similar responsiveness to spring temperatures (2–4 days °CÀ1). Offset dates in the stand tracked August–September temperatures, except when late summer drought caused premature senescence. The common garden-like experiment provides evidence that warming alone extends the growing season, at both ends, even if stand-level impacts may be complicated by variation in other environmental factors.},

Our new analysis of observational data from the International Phenological Gardens in Europe for the 1959–1996 period revealed that spring events, such as leaf unfolding, have advanced on average by 6.3 days (–0.21 day/year), whereas autumn events, such as leaf colouring, have been delayed on average by 4.5 days (+0.15 day/year). Thus, the average annual growing season has lengthened on average by 10.8 days since the early 1960s. For autumn events, differences between mean trends of species could not be detected, but for spring events there were differences between species, with the higher trends for leaf unfolding and flowering of shrubs indicating that changes in events occurring in the early spring are more distinct. These observed trends in plant phenological events in the International Phenological Gardens and results of other phenological studies in Europe, summarised in this study, are consistent with AVHRR satellite measurements of the normalized difference vegetation index from 1981 to 1991 and with an analysis of long-term measurements of the annual cycle of CO2 concentration in Hawaii and Alaska, also indicating a global lengthening of the growing season.},

Similar patterns of clinal variation have been observed along latitudinal and elevational gradients in common garden experiments for many temperate and boreal species. These studies convinced forest managers that a ‘local is best’ seed source policy was usually safest for reforestation. In recent decades, experimental design, phenotyping methods, climatic data and statistical analyses have improved greatly and reﬁned but not radically changed knowledge of clines. The maintenance of local adaptation despite high gene ﬂow suggests selection for local adaptation to climate is strong. Concerns over maladaptation resulting from climate change have motivated many new genecological and population genomics studies; however, few jurisdictions have implemented assisted gene ﬂow (AGF), the translocation of pre-adapted individuals to facilitate adaptation of planted forests to climate change. Here, we provide evidence that temperate tree species show clines along climatic gradients sufﬁciently similar for average patterns or climate models to guide AGF in the absence of species-speciﬁc knowledge. Composite provenancing of multiple seed sources can be used to increase diversity and buffer against future climate uncertainty. New knowledge will continue to reﬁne and improve AGF as climates warm further.},

However, very few models are able to predict species distribution accurately, although we know species respond individually to climate change. Here we show, using a process-based model (PHENOFIT), that tree species distributions can be predicted precisely if the biological processes of survival and reproductive success only are incorporated as a function of phenology. These predictions showed great predictive power when tested against present distributions of two North American species ± quaking aspen and sugar maple ± indicating that on a broad scale, the fundamental niche of trees coincides with their realized niche. Phenology is shown here to be a major determinant of plant species range and should therefore be used to assess the consequences of global warming on plant distributions, and the spread of alien plant species.},

We analyzed existing data sets on 2298 animal—pollinated angiosperms of North and South Carolina and 1575 animal—pollinated angiosperms of temperate Japan, and also analyzed a null model based upon the Carolina flora. Our analyses of the complete data sets and of subsets including only the largest families showed that: (1) the floras of the Carolinas and temperate Japan have bimodal distributions of flowering times, with peaks in spring and late summer; (2) within each of these floras, families differ very significantly in flowering time; (3) for most families, flowering times in the Carolinas and in Japan are statistically indistinguishable; (4) the sequences of flowering, ordered by family, are also statistically indistinguishable in the two floras; (5) within each flora, skewness of flowering time differs markedly among families; (6) for a typical family, the skewness of flowering time is the same in the two floras; (7) there is a significant negative correlation between skewness and mean family flowering time; and (8) life forms differ in flowering time, though less markedly than families. These results demonstrate that phylogenetic membership and life form strongly influence a species' flowering time. We argue that seasonal limitations of flowering times are caused by phylogenetic constraints, which may not have changed for millions of years. This study does not provide the degree of resolution needed to determine whether or not there is natural selection for alteration of flowering times in these floras, whether by competition or other mechanisms. However, our results do suggest that competition for pollination does not push species' flowering times beyond seasonal boundaries imposed by phylogenetic constraints. The effects of competition on flowering time are probably limited to small and temporary readjustments of the phenological relationships of competitors. Studies of the flowering times of animal—pollinated plants must consider the strong limits to seasonal displacement imposed by phylogeny and life form, and the probable existence of many alternative modes of escape from competition besides seasonal shifts. We consider the implications of recent paleobotanical studies that suggest that temperate plant communities may not have been sufficiently stable through time for plants to have achieved competitive equilibria. Phylogenetic and life history constraints are likely to influence the evolution of many community characters besides flowering time. The methods we have used and the conclusions we have drawn are relevant to a wide variety of ecological characters in plants and animals.},

              Global climate change impacts can already be tracked in many physical and biological systems; in particular, terrestrial ecosystems provide a consistent picture of observed changes. One of the preferred indicators is phenology, the science of natural recurring events, as their recorded dates provide a high‐temporal resolution of ongoing changes. Thus, numerous analyses have demonstrated an earlier onset of spring events for mid and higher latitudes and a lengthening of the growing season. However, published single‐site or single‐species studies are particularly open to suspicion of being biased towards predominantly reporting climate change‐induced impacts. No comprehensive study or meta‐analysis has so far examined the possible lack of evidence for changes or shifts at sites where no temperature change is observed. We used an enormous systematic phenological network data set of more than 125 000 observational series of 542 plant and 19 animal species in 21 European countries (1971–2000). Our results showed that 78\% of all leafing, flowering and fruiting records advanced (30\% significantly) and only 3\% were significantly delayed, whereas the signal of leaf colouring/fall is ambiguous. We conclude that previously published results of phenological changes were not biased by reporting or publication predisposition: the average advance of spring/summer was 2.5 days decade
              −1
              in Europe. Our analysis of 254 mean national time series undoubtedly demonstrates that species' phenology is responsive to temperature of the preceding months (mean advance of spring/summer by 2.5 days°C
              −1
              , delay of leaf colouring and fall by 1.0 day°C
              −1
              ). The pattern of observed change in spring efficiently matches measured national warming across 19 European countries (correlation coefficient

Our aim here is to demonstrate that the sensitivity of such models to climate input characteristics may complicate their validation and introduce uncertainties in their predictions. In this study, we conducted a sensitivity analysis of a process-based tree distribution model PHENOFIT to climate input characteristics. This analysis was conducted for two North American trees which differ greatly in their distribution and eight different types of climate input for the historic period which differ in their spatial (local or gridded data) and temporal (daily vs. monthly) resolution as well as their type (locally recorded, extrapolated or simulated by General Circulation Models). We show that the climate data resolution (spatial and temporal) and their type, highly affect the model predictions. The sensitivity analysis also revealed, the importance, for global climate change impact assessment, of (i) the daily variability of temperatures in modeling the biological processes shaping species distribution, (ii) climate data at high latitudes and elevations and (iii) climate data with high spatial resolution.},

It has been widely investigated theoretically, and many putative examples have been cited including practical ones such as the dormancy involved in microbe and weed persistence. However, long-term data on demographic variation from the actual evolutionarily relevant environments have been unavailable to test for its mechanistic relationship to alleged bet hedging traits. I report an association between delayed germination (a bet hedging trait) and risk using a 22-year data set on demographic variation for 10 species of desert annual plants. Species with greater variation in reproductive success (per capita survival from germination to reproduction 3 per capita fecundity of survivors) were found to have lower average germination fractions. This provides a deﬁnitive test using realistic data on demographic variance that conﬁrms the life history prediction for bet hedging. I also showed that the species with greater long-term demographic variation tended to be the ones with greater sensitivity of reproductive success to variation among years in growing-season precipitation.},

A genetically informed photothermal model of progression toward flowering explained most of the observed variation and predicted an abrupt transition from autumn flowering to spring flowering in late-summer germinants. Environmental signals control the timing of this transition, creating a critical window of acute sensitivity to genetic and climatic change that may be common for seasonally regulated life history traits.},

Seed mass and number, as well as maternal survival via plant size, are dependent on time for development. The time available in the favorable season will also affect the size of the developing juveniles and their survival through the unfavorable season. Flowering time may thus represent the outcome of such a time partitioning problem. We analyzed correlations between flowering onset time, seed mass, and plant height in a north‐temperate flora, using both cross‐species comparisons and phylogenetic comparative methods. Among perennial herbs, flowering onset time was negatively correlated with seed mass (i.e. plants with larger seeds started flowering earlier) while flowering onset time was positively correlated with plant height. Neither of these correlations was found among woody plants. Among annual plants, flowering onset time was positively correlated with seed mass. Cross‐species and phylogenetically informed analyses largely agreed, except that flowering onset time was also positively correlated with plant height among annuals in the cross‐species analysis. The different signs of the correlations between flowering onset time and seed mass (compar. gee regression coefficient=−7.8) and flowering onset time and plant height (compar. gee regression coefficient=+30.5) for perennial herbs, indicate that the duration of the growth season may underlie a tradeoff between maternal size and offspring size in perennial herbs, and we discuss how the partitioning of the season between parents and offspring may explain the association between early flowering and larger seed mass among these plants.},

Yet, some process-based species distribution models have been able to simulate plants and insects distribution at a global scale. These models strongly rely on the completion of the annual cycle of the species and therefore on their accomplished phenology. In particular, they have shown that the northern limit of species' ranges appears to be caused mainly by the inability to undergo full fruit maturation, while the southern limit appears to be caused by the inability to flower or unfold leaves owing to a lack of chilling temperatures that are necessary to break bud dormancy. I discuss here why phenology is a key adaptive trait in shaping species distribution using mostly examples from plant species, which have been the most documented. After discussing how phenology is involved in fitness and why it is an adaptive trait susceptible to evolve quickly in changing climate conditions, I describe how phenology is related to fitness in species distribution process-based models and discuss the fate of species under climate change scenarios using model projections and experimental or field studies from the literature.},

In a 6year ﬁeld experiment, a dominant prairie bunchgrass, Schizachyrium scoparium, excluded species sharing similar phenology and rooting depth, but coexisted with species diﬀering in phenology and rooting depth. We used a series of experimental plots that diﬀered in S. scoparium abundance to measure the eﬀect of S. scoparium on abundances of other species and on soil nitrate concentrations across time and depth. Because we found that S. scoparium most strongly reduced soil nitrate levels at mid-season and at shallow depths, we hypothesized that at higher S. scoparium abundance, species with mid-season phenology and shallow roots would be excluded and that deep-rooted and early season species would be more likely to persist. As predicted, the proportional number and cover of species exploiting diﬀerent niches than S. scoparium (early season and deep-rooted species) increased across the S. scoparium abundance gradient. This work provides novel empirical evidence for the factors that contribute to species coexistence in the ﬁeld. Our study suggests that spatial and temporal niche diﬀerentiation promote species coexistence in these grasslands.},

                  Within the same forest stand, temperate deciduous trees generally exhibit a distinct pattern in leaf‐out timing, with some species flushing earlier than other species. This study aimed to explain the timing of leaf‐out of various temperate tree species in relation to the risk of freezing damage to leaves.
                
                
                  
                    We combined long‐term series of leaf‐out date (14–32 years) of five temperate tree species located in both low and high elevations in Switzerland, daily minimum temperatures recorded at the same sites and species‐specific freezing resistance (
                    LT
                    50
                    ) of emerging leaves. We calculated temperature safety margins (the temperature difference between absolute minimum temperature during leaf‐out and species‐specific
                    LT
                    50
                    values), and date safety margins (time lag between the last day when temperature falls below species‐specific
                    LT
                    50
                    values and the date of leaf‐out).
                  
                
                
                  Leaf‐out occurred when the probability to encounter freezing damage approaches zero, irrespective of climatic conditions (low vs. high elevation) and species (early‐ and late‐flushing species). In other words, trees leaf out precisely at the beginning of the probabilistically safe period. Interestingly, the temperature safety margins did not differ significantly between low and high elevation. Yet, the date safety margin was smaller at high elevation, presumably due to a faster increase in temperature during the leaf‐out period at high elevation.
                
                
                  
                    When species‐specific freezing resistance is taken into account, the time of leaf‐out converges among species towards a marginal risk of freezing damage. Thus, leaf‐out time has likely evolved in a way that the risk of freezing damage is minimized over a large spectrum of climatic conditions. Species with a small safety margin against freezing temperature, like
                    Fagus sylvatica
                    , appear to employ photoperiod co‐control of spring phenology, whereas species with a large safety margin depend largely on temperature for the right timing of leaf‐out.
                  
                
                
                  Our results offer a new avenue to explain the differences in leaf‐out timing among co‐occurring tree species. They further suggest that in a warming climate, tree species can expand their distribution range to the extent their phenology matches the stochasticity of freezing temperatures in spring.},

	abstract = {Background: Winter chill is one of the defining characteristics of a location’s suitability for the production of many tree crops. We mapped and investigated observed historic and projected future changes in winter chill in California, quantified with two different chilling models (Chilling Hours, Dynamic Model).
Methodology/Principal Findings: Based on hourly and daily temperature records, winter chill was modeled for two past temperature scenarios (1950 and 2000), and 18 future scenarios (average conditions during 2041–2060 and 2080–2099 under each of the B1, A1B and A2 IPCC greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, for the CSIRO-MK3, HadCM3 and MIROC climate models). For each scenario, 100 replications of the yearly temperature record were produced, using a stochastic weather generator. We then introduced and mapped a novel climatic statistic, ‘‘safe winter chill’’, the 10\% quantile of the resulting chilling distributions. This metric can be interpreted as the amount of chilling that growers can safely expect under each scenario. Winter chill declined substantially for all emissions scenarios, with the area of safe winter chill for many tree species or cultivars decreasing 50–75\% by mid-21st century, and 90–100\% by late century.
Conclusions/Significance: Both chilling models consistently projected climatic conditions by the middle to end of the 21st century that will no longer support some of the main tree crops currently grown in California, with the Chilling Hours Model projecting greater changes than the Dynamic Model. The tree crop industry in California will likely need to develop agricultural adaptation measures (e.g. low-chill varieties and dormancy-breaking chemicals) to cope with these projected changes. For some crops, production might no longer be possible.},

	abstract = {Recent shifts in phenology are the best documented biological response to current anthropogenic climate change, yet remain poorly understood from a functional point of view. Prevailing analyses are phenomenological and approximate, only correlating temperature records to imprecise records of phenological events. To advance our understanding of phenological responses to climate change, we developed, calibrated, and validated process-based models of leaf unfolding for 22 North American tree species. Using daily meteorological data predicted by two scenarios (A2: 1 3.2 1C and B2: 1 1 1C) from the HadCM3 GCM, we predicted and compared range-wide shifts of leaf unfolding in the 20th and 21st centuries for each species. Model predictions suggest that climate change will affect leaf phenology in almost all species studied, with an average advancement during the 21st century of 5.0 days in the A2 scenario and 9.2 days in the B2 scenario. Our model also suggests that lack of sufﬁcient chilling temperatures to break bud dormancy will decrease the rate of advancement in leaf unfolding date during the 21st century for many species. Some temperate species may even have years with abnormal budburst due to insufﬁcient chilling. Species fell into two groups based on their sensitivity to climate change: (1) species that consistently had a greater advance in their leaf unfolding date with increasing latitude and (2) species in which the advance in leaf unfolding differed from the center to the northern vs. southern margins of their range. At the interspeciﬁc level, we predicted that early-leaﬁng species tended to show a greater advance in leaf unfolding date than late-leaﬁng species; and that species with larger ranges tend to show stronger phenological changes. These predicted changes in phenology have signiﬁcant implications for the frost susceptibility of species, their interspeciﬁc relationships, and their distributional shifts.},

              , we explore how variation in different genetic pathways can be linked to phenology and life-history variation across geographical regions and seasons. We show that the expression of phenological traits including flowering depends critically on the growth season, and we outline an integrated life-history approach to phenology in which the timing of later life-history events can be contingent on the environmental cues regulating earlier life stages. As flowering time in many plants is determined by the integration of multiple environmentally sensitive gene pathways, the novel combinations of important seasonal cues in projected future climates will alter how phenology responds to variation in the flowering time gene network with important consequences for plant life history. We discuss how phenology models in other systems—both natural and agricultural—could employ a similar framework to explore the potential contribution of genetic variation to the physiological integration of cues determining phenology.},

	abstract = {Two assumptions underlie current models of the geographical ranges of perennial plant species: 1. current ranges are in equilibrium with the prevailing climate, and 2. changes are attributable to changes in macroclimatic factors, including tolerance of winter cold, the duration of the growing season, and water stress during the growing season, rather than to biotic interactions. These assumptions allow model parameters to be estimated from current species ranges. Deterioration of growing conditions due to climate change, e.g. more severe drought, will cause local extinction. However, for many plant species, the predicted climate change of higher minimum temperatures and longer growing seasons means, improved growing conditions. Biogeographical models may under some circumstances predict that a species will become locally extinct, despite improved growing conditions, because they are based on an assumption of equilibrium and this forces the species range to match the species-specific macroclimatic thresholds. We argue that such model predictions should be rejected unless there is evidence either that competition influences the position of the range margins or that a certain physiological mechanism associated with the apparent improvement in growing conditions negatively affects the species performance. We illustrate how a process-based vegetation model can be used to ascertain whether such a physiological cause exists. To avoid potential modelling errors of this type, we propose a method that constrains the scenario predictions of the envelope models by changing the geographical distribution of the dominant plant functional type. Consistent modelling results are very important for evaluating how changes in species areas affect local functional trait diversity and hence ecosystem functioning and resilience, and for inferring the implications for conservation management in the face of climate change.},

	abstract = {Research Highlights: Yellow-cedar decline on the island archipelago of Haida Gwaii is driven by warm winter temperatures and low winter precipitation, which is caused by anthropogenic climate change and exacerbated by the positive phase of the Paciﬁc Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Background and Objectives: Declining yellow-cedars are limited by physiological drought during the growing season, caused by freezing damage to ﬁne roots through a complex pathway identiﬁed by research in Alaska. Given this, we hypothesized: (1) yellow-cedars on Haida Gwaii were limited by the winter climate. (2) Trees of diﬀerent health classes were responding diﬀerently to climatic variation. (3) Changing climate-growth relations would vary among phases of the PDO. Materials and Methods: We sampled 15 stands exhibiting crown symptoms and developed three regional chronologies from trees that were healthy, had crown or tree-ring symptoms of decline, and trees that had died. We tested for growth responses to inter-annual and multi-decadal variation in climate among trees of diﬀerent health statuses using correlation functions and wavelet analyses. Results: The three chronologies had similar patterns from the early 1500s to 1900s and responded to climate in the same way, with multi-decadal variability, and common narrow marker years. Climate-growth responses among trees of diﬀerent health statuses diverged after the 1976/1977 switch in the PDO. Warm growing season temperatures facilitated the growth of trees in the healthy chronology. By contrast, growth of trees that showed symptoms of decline or had died was negatively associated with low winter precipitation. After 1986, growth of trees in the declining chronology decreased sharply and mortality increased, which is concurrent with the warmest winter temperatures and consistent with the root-freezing hypothesis from Alaska. Conclusions: Yellow-cedar decline is driven by climate change, exacerbated by the PDO. Warming winter temperatures, accelerated by anthropogenic climate change, have led to dieback and death of yellow-cedars, even with the temperate ocean-moderated climate of Haida Gwaii.},
