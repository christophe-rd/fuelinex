###### SUMMARY OF RESEARCH PROPOSAL

Temperate and boreal forests are closely linked to temperature, a critical factor in regulating the boundaries of trees’ seasonal activity. Human-induced climate change has led to a global rise in temperatures, extending the growing season in numerous ecosystems. Shifts in plant phenology —the study of recurring life history events— have already been observed and are expected to continue with warmer temperatures. Since spring arrives earlier and fall is delayed, trees could take advantage of these additional days to fix and store more carbon. Extended spring and fall events could affect the next growing season. This is rarely tested, however, and tests often used adult trees where many co-varying factors make teasing out the effect of longer seasons difficult. Here, I propose an extended season experiment using tree saplings to test this hypothesis. Given this, what will be the response of different tree species saplings to an extended growth period and fall nutrient supplements during the current year and in the following season? I hypothesize that an extended growing season influences trees' storage pools, and species capable of utilizing this opportunity may exhibit growth increments in the following year. Additionally, species with the ability to absorb nutrients while going through leaf senescence might also demonstrate increased growth in the following year.

To assess trees' capacity to extend their activity schedules, I conducted experiments in 2024 across seven tree species under controlled conditions. Among these, five were deciduous trees, and two were conifers. I used a full factorial design of four treatments including spring warming, fall warming, both, and a control, plus an additional two treatments to test fall nutrient effects. In 2024, I tracked phenological events weekly throughout the entire season. In 2025, I will repeat these measurements. After the trees have grown under ambient temperatures for the season, I will assess growth on both the individual and the cellular level using dendrochronological methods.
