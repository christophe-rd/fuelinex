###### SUMMARY OF RESEARCH PROPOSAL

Temperate and boreal forests are closely linked to temperature, a critical factor in regulating trees’ seasonal activity. Human-induced climate change has led to a global rise in temperatures, extending the growing season in numerous ecosystems.  As spring arrives earlier and fall events are delayed, trees are expected to use these longer seasons to fix and store more carbon. However, recent research has questioned this major assumption since tests to date do not always find a correlation between growth and longer seasons. Part of the problem is that research to date uses adult trees where many co-varying factors make teasing out the effect of longer seasons difficult; additionally effects may be delayed or limited if plants are nutrient limited. Here, I propose an experiment that can overcome these challenges. By using an experiment on tree saplings to extend seasons, including a nutrient addition treatment, then measuring growth across two years, I will be able to test for effects of growth in a controlled design. I hypothesize that an extended growing season influences trees' storage pools, and species capable of utilizing this opportunity may exhibit growth increments in the following year. Additionally, species with the ability to absorb nutrients while going through leaf senescence might show further increased growth in the following year.

To assess trees' capacity to extend their activity schedules, I started a major experiment in 2024 across seven tree species under controlled conditions. Among these, five were deciduous trees, and two were conifers. I used a full factorial design of four treatments including spring warming, fall warming, both, and a control, plus an additional two treatments to test fall nutrient effects. In 2024, I tracked phenological events weekly throughout the entire season. In 2025, I will repeat these measurements. After the trees have grown under ambient temperatures for the season, I will assess growth on both the individual and the cellular level using tree ring methods and total biomass.
