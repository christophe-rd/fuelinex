###### SUMMARY OF RESEARCH PROPOSAL

Temperate forests are closely linked to temperature, a critical factor in regulating tree seasonal activity. Anthropogenic climate change has led to a global rise in temperatures, extending the growing season in numerous ecosystems. As spring arrives earlier and fall events are delayed, trees are expected to use these longer seasons to fix and store more carbon. However, recent research has questioned this major assumption since tests do not always find a correlation between growth and longer seasons. Part of the problem is the use of adult trees where many co-varying factors make teasing out the effect of longer seasons difficult; additionally, effects may be delayed if plants are nutrient-limited. Here, I propose an experiment that can overcome these challenges. By using tree saplings to extend seasons and including a nutrient addition treatment, I will measure growth across two years to test for effects in a controlled design. I hypothesize that an extended growing season influences trees' storage pools, and species capable of utilizing this opportunity may exhibit growth increments in the following year. Additionally, species capable of absorbing nutrients while going through leaf senescence might show further increased growth in the next season. 

To assess trees' capacity to extend their activity schedules, I started a major experiment in 2024 across seven tree species under controlled conditions. I used a full factorial design of four treatments including spring warming, fall warming, both, and a control, plus an additional two treatments to test fall nutrient effects. In 2024, I tracked phenological events weekly throughout the entire season. In 2025, I will repeat these measurements, and I will assess growth on both the individual and the cellular level.
