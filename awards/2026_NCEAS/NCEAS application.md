#### “Turning data into action” can be taken in a variety of directions. Give an example from your own work where you’ve led or supported efforts to do this. (150 words max)
One of my three MSc projects leverages ten years of data from a citizen-science program at the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University. For a decade, citizen scientists have monitored the phenology of 50 trees, providing us with a valuable and rare dataset on continuous developmental phases for different species. I extended this work by sampling tree cores from the same individuals, scanning them at high resolution, and building a Bayesian hierarchical model to link phenological patterns with annual tree growth. This integration allows us to test how the phenology of different species drives growth patterns across years. During my visit at the Arboretum, I shared my research questions with the citizen scientists who collected the data to reinforce my research outreach. By combining leaf phenology with dendrochronological data, I am hoping to turn long-term monitoring into actionable insights that can better inform city forest planners about the tree species best suited for urban planting under future climate change.

#### What about your lived experience and/or work leads you to be interested in pursuing the intersection of environmental data science and real-world conservation issues? This could be anything from creating data visuals to effectively communicating science to policy makers or engaging with resource managers to align on scientific outcomes. (150 words max)

My interest in environmental data science comes from my desire to bridge "raw observations" into practical guidance for conservation and urban forest resilience. With the tree ring data collected at the arboretum, paired with phenology observations from the citizen scientists, I'll be able to infer---in an urban environmental landscape---which trees respond best to increased extreme events under climate change. These extreme events bring serious risks for urban trees, which provide humans with strong benefits such as shade, cooling and better air quality. Understanding how species differ in their climate resilience, I aim to generate recommendations that help policymakers choose the most climate-adapted species for urban planting under climate change. This work increased my appreciation for community engagement. Presenting my research directly to the volunteers who collected the data showed me how data science can empower people to see the tangible value of their contributions and strengthen links between science, policy, and the public.

#### How will attending this workshop advance your professional development? What are you hoping to achieve by the end of the workshop? (100 words max)
As a second-year MSc student, I constantly seek opportunities to expand my technical and professional skills. Attending this workshop would help me refine how I communicate data-driven findings to audiences outside of academia. I hope to strengthen my ability to create clear, actionable data visualizations, learn strategies for aligning research with management needs, and connect with peers who share an interest in applied environmental science. By the end of the workshop, I aim to emerge better equipped to bridge academic research with real-world conservation decisions and to share those insights with my collaborators.
