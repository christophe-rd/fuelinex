# EcoEvo abstract
## 5 October 2025

Climate change is intensifying extreme weather events, posing significant challenges to urban and forest ecosystems. Rising temperatures, heat waves, and increasing wildfire frequency threaten biodiversity and human well-being. In urban environments, tree cover provides critical services that can help mitigate these threats. Trees help cool local areas, reducing the impact of heat waves, while also sequestering carbon and improving air quality. Additionally, exposure to trees has been linked to mental and physical health benefits. With my Master's research, I aim to identify tree species best suited for warmer and drier conditions in British Columbia, optimizing urban tree planting strategies and reforestation efforts for climate resilience. I will present preliminary results from a common garden trial using juvenile trees to understand how growing season length affects growth, by leveraging leaf phenology and tree ring data.
