## EDI in research





With my research, I aim to understand how climate change reshapes tree growth while addressing social and environmental inequities in urban landscapes. I will integrate Indigenous knowledge alongside ecological theory, working directly with communities to ensure findings support culturally grounded forest management. I continue my ongoing citizen science work to broaden participation, particularly among underrepresented groups in low-income areas with limited green space. Results will be shared through non-predatory journals, broad multilingual outreach, and collaboration with Indigenous and urban stakeholders to promote equitable, climate-resilient urban forests and sustainable natural ecosystems.
