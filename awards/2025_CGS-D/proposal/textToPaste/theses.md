##How climate change will re-shape mixed temporate forest: evidence from experimental and observational data
Climate change is intensifying extreme weather events, posing significant challenges to urban and forest ecosystems. Rising temperatures and wildfire frequency threaten biodiversity and human well-being. In urban environments, tree cover provides critical services that can help mitigate these threats. My ongoing Master’s research identifies tree species suited for warmer, drier conditions in BC, to optimize planting and reforestation for climate resilience.. For this, I conducted an experiment on tree saplings and leveraged data from a common garden and a community science program in an urban arboretum.

### Chapter 1:
For my first chapter, my question is: How do extended manipulated spring and fall temperatures affect tree phenological phases across different species? To investigate the impact of manipulated spring and fall temperatures on phenology, I successfully conducted experiments in 2024 across seven species under controlled conditions, spanning fast/short-lived (e.g., Populus balsamifera) and slow/long-lived (e.g., Quercus macrocarpa), including both deciduous and evergreen (e.g., Quercus macrocarpa) and including both deciduous and evergreen species. I used a full factorial design of spring and fall warming with two levels each (control/ warmed), resulting in four treatments plus an additional two treatments to test fall nutrient effects, 15 replicates each (630 trees total). Throughout the growing season of 2024, I tracked phenological events weekly to build a Bayesian hierarchical model investigating phenology across treatments and species. My preliminary results suggest very different responses across species, where fast-growth species seem to be more responsive to longer seasons than slow-growth species. These results will help select urban tree species that best exploit longer growing seasons under climate change.

### Chapter 2:
The research question of my second chapter is: How do phenological phases regulate mature and juvenile tree growth in urban ecosystems? Recent research has shown that phenological traits are critical in regulating tree growth in urban ecosystems. Thus, I am complementing this large-scale experiment with two additional projects at the Arnold Arboretum that broaden perspectives on how phenology relates to season length and temperature. First, I used five years of leaf phenology and tree cross-sections data that were collected in the common garden study to analyze how tree ring width relates to leaf phenology across years. Second, I leveraged 10 years of Treespotters phenology data to test how season length affects mature trees. I analyzed tree-rings of 50 trees of 11 species with a cross-design Bayesian model linking growth rings to phenology. My results suggest a much greater response in amplitude from the juvenile trees to growing season length than from mature trees. This aligns with literature suggesting young trees more easily exploit extra days, with consequences for forest regeneration under climate change.. These projects together have the potential to improve and guide urban and natural forest planning in the face of fast-paced climate change.


#### *To add to main text*:
 In the upcoming fall 2025, after the trees have grown in ambient temperatures for the season, I will assess growth on the individual (total biomass) and the cellular level (number of cells and their characteristics), using dendrochronological methods.
