##How Climate Change Will Reshape Mixed Temperate Forests: Evidence from Experimental and Observational Data
Climate change is intensifying extreme weather events, posing significant challenges to urban and forest ecosystems. Rising temperatures and wildfire frequency threaten biodiversity and human well-being. In urban environments, tree cover provides critical services that can help mitigate these threats. My ongoing Master’s research identifies tree species suited for warmer, drier conditions in BC to optimize planting and reforestation for climate resilience. For this, I conducted an experiment on tree saplings and leveraged data from a common garden and a community science program in an urban arboretum.

### Chapter 1:
For my first chapter, my question is: How do extended manipulated spring and fall temperatures affect tree phenological phases across different species? To investigate the impact of manipulated spring and fall temperatures on phenology, I successfully conducted experiments in 2024 across seven species under controlled conditions, spanning fast/short-lived (e.g., Populus balsamifera) and slow/long-lived (e.g., Quercus macrocarpa), including both deciduous and evergreen species. I used a full factorial design of spring and fall warming with two levels each (control / warmed), resulting in four treatments plus an additional two treatments to test fall nutrient effects, 15 replicates each (630 trees total). Throughout the 2024 growing season, I tracked phenological events weekly and built a Bayesian hierarchical model to investigate differences across treatments and species. My preliminary results suggest very different responses across species, where fast-growing species seem to be more responsive to longer seasons than slow-growth species. These results will help select urban tree species that best exploit longer growing seasons under climate change.

### Chapter 2:
The research question of my second chapter is: How do phenological phases regulate growth in both mature and juvenile trees in urban ecosystems? Recent research shows that phenological traits are critical in regulating tree growth in urban ecosystems. Thus, I am complementing this large-scale experiment with two additional projects at the Arnold Arboretum that broaden perspectives on how phenology relates to season length and temperature. First, I used five years of leaf phenology and tree cross-section data that were collected in the common garden study to analyze how tree ring width relates to leaf phenology across years. Second, I leveraged 10 years of Treespotters phenology data to test how season length affects mature trees. I analyzed tree rings of 50 trees of 11 species with a Bayesian cross-design model linking growth rings to phenology. My results suggest juvenile trees show a much greater growth response to season length than mature trees, consistent with literature indicating that young trees exploit additional growing days more readily, which has important implications for future forest regeneration in a warming world. Together, these projects can directly inform strategies for urban and natural forest planning under rapid climate change.


#### *To add to main text*:
 In the upcoming fall 2025, after the trees have grown in ambient temperatures for the season, I will assess growth on the individual (total biomass) and the cellular level (number of cells and their characteristics), using dendrochronological methods.
