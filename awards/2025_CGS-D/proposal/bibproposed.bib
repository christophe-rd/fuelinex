	abstract = {A delay of leaf senescence resulting from variable fall climate may allow for additional nutrient resorption, and storage within reserve organs. Autumn leaves and reserve organs ({\textless}1 year shoots, {\textgreater}1 year shoots, stem above and below the graft union, the tap root, and fine roots) during dormancy of young peach trees were evaluated following warmer fall temperatures and limited soil moisture on two cultivars (‘Scarletprince’ and ‘Autumnprince’ both on GuardianTM rootstock) over two seasons. Four treatments were established for the two cultivars: (1) well-watered trees (100\% ETc needs) in ambient outdoor temperatures; (2) water deficient trees (50\% ETc needs) in ambient outdoor temperatures; (3) well-watered trees grown within a greenhouse; and (4) water deficient trees within a greenhouse. The greenhouse environment was on average 5°C warmer than the ambient outdoor temperature. Senescence was delayed on greenhouse-grown trees both years with leaf number and area similar in the greenhouse and outdoor environments prior to senescence. Across leaf samples, leaf nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were lower within delayed senescence tree leaves while potassium was lower in leaves experiencing normal senescence. During dormancy, multiple reserve organs showed higher nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in trees with delayed senescence than normal senescence and similar increases were observed in water-deficient trees compared to well-watered trees. Phosphorus and potassium concentrations were also higher in multiple reserve organs within ‘Autumnprince’ trees compared to ‘Scarletprince’ trees. This study suggests variable climate conditions of increased temperatures or reduced soil moisture during autumn resulting in delayed senescence influence the process of nutrient resorption and increase nutrient storage within reserve organs.},

	abstract = {The effects of winter chilling, spring forcing temperature, and photoperiod on spring phenology are well known for many European and North American species, but the environmental cues that regulate the spring phenology of East Asian species have not yet been thoroughly investigated. Here, we conducted a growth chamber experiment to test the effects of chilling (controlled by different lengths of exposure to natural chilling conditions), forcing temperature (12, 15, or 18°C) and photoperiod (14 or 10 h) on first flowering date (FFD) of six woody species (three shrubs and three trees) native to East Asia. The three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) separately for each species showed that the effects of chilling and forcing temperature were significant for almost all species (P {\textless} 0.05). Averaged over all chilling and photoperiod treatments, the number of days until FFD decreased by 2.3–36.1 days when the forcing temperature increased by 3°C. More chilling days reduced the time to FFD by 0.7–26 days, when averaged over forcing and photoperiod treatments. A longer photoperiod could advance the FFD by 1.0–5.6 days, on average, but its effect was only significant for two species (including one tree and one shrub). The effects of forcing temperature and photoperiod interacted with chilling for half of the studied species, being stronger in the low chilling than high chilling treatment. These results could be explained by the theory and model of growing degree-days (GDD). Increased exposure to chilling coupled to a longer photoperiod reduced the GDD requirement for FFD, especially when plants grew under low chilling conditions. However, shrubs (except Viburnum dilatatum) had lower chilling and heat requirements than trees, suggesting that, by leafing out sooner, they engage in a more opportunistic life strategy to maximize their growing season, especially before canopy closure from trees' foliage. Our results confirmed the varying effects of these three cues on the flowering phenology of woody species native to East Asia. In future climate change scenarios, spring warming is likely to advance the spring phenology of those woody species, although the reduced chilling and shorter photoperiod may partly offset this spring warming effect.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing provides spatially and temporally continuous measures of forest reflectance, and vegetation indices calculated from satellite data can be useful for monitoring climate change impacts on forest tree phenology. Monitoring of evergreen coniferous forest is more difficult than monitoring of deciduous forest, as the new buds only account for a small proportion of the green biomass, and the shoot elongation process is relatively slow. In this study, we have analyzed data from 186 coniferous monitoring sites in Sweden covering boreal, southern-boreal, and boreo-nemoral conditions. Our objective was to examine the possibility to track seasonal changes in coniferous forests by time-series of MODIS eight-day vegetation indices, testing the coherence between satellite monitored vegetation indices (VI) and temperature dependent phenology. The relationships between two vegetation indices (NDVI and WDRVI) and four phenological indicators (length of snow season, modeled onset of vegetation period, tree cold hardiness level and timing of budburst) were analyzed. The annual curves produced by two curve fitting methods for smoothening of seasonal changes in NDVI and WDRVI were to a large extent characterized by the occurrence of snow, producing stable seasonal oscillations in the northern part and irregular curves with less pronounced annual amplitude in the southern part of the country. Measures based on threshold values of the VI-curves, commonly used for determining the timing of different phenological phases, were not applicable for Swedish coniferous forests. Evergreen vegetation does not have a sharp increase in greenness during spring, and the melting of snow can influence the vegetation indices at the timing of budburst in boreal forests. However, the interannual variation in VI-values for specific eight-day periods was correlated with the phenological indicators. This relation can be used for satellite monitoring of potential climate change impacts on northern coniferous spring phenology.},

Prior to planting, nursery-produced seedlings were placed in cold storage (−3°C) and root growth potential (RGP) and total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) root reserves were tested at 0, 10, 75 and after 150 (container) and 190 days (BR) of storage. Both container and BR stock had much lower root to shoot ratios (RSRs) and root carbohydrate reserves compared to UR seedlings after 170 days. During storage, root reserves in container stock declined faster than in the BR and UR seedlings. RGP in all nursery stock was the highest after 75 days of storage, while longer storage resulted in shoot dieback and reduced root growth. After the first growing season, UR seedlings were one tenth the size of the nursery stock; however, in the second growing season they had no stem dieback and grew twice the height and stem diameter. The higher RSRs and root reserves in the UR seedlings was likely caused by early bud set in its first year of growth. This suggests that inducing bud set earlier in the growing regime might allow seedlings to increase root mass and carbohydrate reserves.},

	abstract = {Increasingly, trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) is being planted in stressful situations such as forest land reclamation, afforestation and forest restoration in North America. This is due to its fast potential for growth and high resiliency, but its indeterminate growth strategy provides a special challenge in creating suitable planting stock for these sites. Clues from naturally established aspen seedlings suggest that root total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) reserves and root:shoot ratio could be strongly related to subsequent seedling establishment and growth. Carbon allocation in plants is generally partitioned between reserve accumulation and growth and development. Under conditions in controlled nurseries, the allocation of carbohydrates to reserves could be manipulated in order to produce seedlings designed for specific environmental conditions. To manipulate seedling characteristics we attempted to induce premature bud set during nursery culture while allowing continued photosynthesis. Treatments included applying different fertilizer regimes, light intensities, reducing photoperiod and use of a shoot growth inhibitor. The shoot growth inhibitor was the most reliable treatment and resulted in complete bud set, while blackout was successful only when seedlings were grown outside. Low nutrient treatments also resulted in early bud set; however, leaves were abscised much earlier. There was a distinct trade-off between growth and reserve accumulation with the late bud set. A longer period of height growth reduced root and total TNC reserves, while early bud set allowed for continued photosynthesis and produced the highest levels of root and total TNC reserves in seedlings. Increased TNC reserves of aspen planting stock was positively related to height growth after outplanting, with root TNC reserves as high as 33\% of dry weight and root:shoot ratios greater than 2 associated with the best growth.},

	abstract = {Nutrient loading of nursery seedling stock of species with an indeterminate growth strategy is challenging and poorly understood. Here, we explore the use of two potential techniques for nutrient loading of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) seedlings: (1) exponential fertilization and (2) early shoot growth termination in order to divert assimilated nutrients and carbon to storage rather than to growth. In the first study, aspen seedlings were treated with either exponential or constant fertilization rates, both of which supplied the same amount of nutrients over the growing season. Exponential fertilization resulted in overall poor planting stock form (stunted seedling growth and weak root development) and produced only marginal improvements of nutrient status. As a result, the exponential fertilization regime studied cannot be recommended as a treatment for aspen seedlings. In the second study we treated seedlings with a 2 × 2 factorial combination of fertilization and shoot growth inhibitor (SGI) applications with the fertilizer treatments varying in terms of mid-season fertilizer concentrations. Seedlings with SGI application had much higher tissue nutrient and carbon reserve concentrations than seedlings without a SGI application. In addition, nutrient uptake appeared to be more efficient in SGI treated seedlings, which could potentially result in significant reductions of nutrient application rates during aspen seedling production in nurseries. Overall, early shoot growth termination using a SGI appears to be an effective technique to produce nutrient loaded aspen seedlings.},

	abstract = {Plant phenology, the annually recurring sequence of plant developmental stages, is important for plant functioning and ecosystem services and their biophysical and biogeochemical feedbacks to the climate system. Plant phenology depends on temperature, and the current rapid climate change has revived interest in understanding and modeling the responses of plant phenology to the warming trend and the consequences thereof for ecosystems. Here, we review recent progresses in plant phenology and its interactions with climate change. Focusing on the start (leaf unfolding) and end (leaf coloring) of plant growing seasons, we show that the recent rapid expansion in ground- and remote sensing- based phenology data acquisition has been highly beneficial and has supported major advances in plant phenology research. Studies using multiple data sources and methods generally agree on the trends of advanced leaf unfolding and delayed leaf coloring due to climate change, yet these trends appear to have decelerated or even reversed in recent years. Our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the plant phenology responses to climate warming is still limited. The interactions between multiple drivers complicate the modeling and prediction of plant phenology changes. Furthermore, changes in plant phenology have important implications for ecosystem carbon cycles and ecosystem feedbacks to climate, yet the quantification of such impacts remains challenging. We suggest that future studies should primarily focus on using new observation tools to improve the understanding of tropical plant phenology, on improving process-based phenology modeling, and on the scaling of phenology from species to landscape-level.},

To investigate whether second-cohort leaves behave differently from first-cohort leaves, we exposed saplings of beech (Fagus sylvatica), oak (Quercus robur), and honeysuckle (Lonicera xylosteum) to experimental treatments mimicking either a warm spring or a warm spring with a leaf-killing frost. Refoliation took 48, 43, and 36 d for beech, oak and honeysuckle, respectively. In beech and oak, autumn Chl content and photosynthesis rates were higher in second- than in first-cohort leaves, senescence in second-cohort leaves occurred c. 2-wk-later, and autumn bud growth in beech was elevated 66\% in frost-damaged plants compared with the warm spring treatment. No differences in autumn phenology and growth were observed for honeysuckle. Overall, in beech and oak, delayed Chl breakdown in second-cohort leaves mitigated 31\% and 25\%, respectively, of the deficit in growing-season length incurred by spring frost damage. These results reveal an unexpected ability of second-cohort leaves of beech and oak to compensate for spring frost damage, and demonstrate that long-lived trees vary their autumnal phenology depending on preceding productivity.},

                  Phenological shifts in response to changing climatic conditions is a key acclimation process for the persistence of perennial plants in temperate and boreal climates. The optimal time to leaf‐out is the result of an evolutionary process determined by the trade‐off between minimizing the risk of freezing damages and herbivory pressure while maximizing resource uptake to increase competitiveness against the other plants.
                
                
                  We quantified the penalty exerted by frost damage at the time of leaf emergence on plant development (reduction in leaf area, canopy duration and growth) over the potential gains without frost (increased biomass and non‐structural carbohydrate reserves), depending on when leaf‐out occurs. To this purpose, we exposed 960 saplings of four temperate deciduous tree species with contrasting cold hardiness to two frost intensities shortly after leaf emergence, which was artificially induced at four occasions to reflect the whole range of natural leaf‐out dates.
                
                
                  
                    One year above‐ground biomass (AGB) increments following the frost revealed a clear ranking among the species depending on their strategy to cope with damaging frosts.
                    Prunus avium
                    (−41\% of AGB‐increment compared to control saplings) resprouted from the stem base,
                    Quercus robur
                    (−62\%) rapidly produced new leaves from dormant reserve buds,
                    Fagus sylvatica
                    (−98\%) showed highest chlorophyll content in autumn and delayed senescence together with
                    Carpinus betulus
                    (−105\%), which overcompensated NSC reserves after the growing season but showed highest mortality (up to 32\%). In all species, NSC reserves recovered rapidly to control levels at the expense of growth.
                  
                
                
                  The timing of leaf‐out (advanced and delayed artificially) significantly affected the performance and recovery (regreening and growth) of both frozen and non‐frozen saplings, with the lowest performance found at the most delayed leaf‐out date. We propose that the potential to recover from frost damages is an important component of a tree's performance, particularly at the juvenile stage. The ability to recover may become even more decisive in the future with the predicted increase of false springs in many extratropical regions.

	abstract = {Predicting forest responses to warming climates relies on assumptions about niche and temperature sensitivity that remain largely untested. Observational studies have related current and historical temperatures to phenological shifts, but experimental evidence is sparse, particularly for autumn responses. A 4 year ﬁeld experiment exposed four deciduous forest species from contrasting climates (Liquidambar styraciﬂua, Quercus rubra, Populus grandidentata, and Betula alleghaniensis) to air temperatures 2 and 4 °C above ambient controls, using temperature-controlled open top chambers. Impacts of year-round warming on bud burst (BB), senescence, and abscission were evaluated in relation to thermal provenance. Leaves emerged earlier in all species by an average of 4–9 days at +2 °C and 6–14 days at +4 °C. Magnitude of advance varied with species and year, but was larger for the ﬁrst 2 °C increment than for the second. Effect of warming increased with early BB, favoring Liquidambar, but even BB of northern species advanced, despite temperatures exceeding those of the realized niche. Treatment differences in BB were inadequately explained by temperature sums alone. In autumn, chlorophyll was retained an average of 4 and 7 days longer in +2 and +4 °C treatments, respectively, and abscission delayed by 8 and 13 days. Growing seasons in the warmer atmospheres averaged 5–18 days (E2) and 6–28 days (E4) longer, according to species, with the least impact in Quercus. Results are compared with a 16 years record of canopy onset and offset in a nearby upland deciduous forest, where BB showed similar responsiveness to spring temperatures (2–4 days °CÀ1). Offset dates in the stand tracked August–September temperatures, except when late summer drought caused premature senescence. The common garden-like experiment provides evidence that warming alone extends the growing season, at both ends, even if stand-level impacts may be complicated by variation in other environmental factors.},

              Global climate change impacts can already be tracked in many physical and biological systems; in particular, terrestrial ecosystems provide a consistent picture of observed changes. One of the preferred indicators is phenology, the science of natural recurring events, as their recorded dates provide a high‐temporal resolution of ongoing changes. Thus, numerous analyses have demonstrated an earlier onset of spring events for mid and higher latitudes and a lengthening of the growing season. However, published single‐site or single‐species studies are particularly open to suspicion of being biased towards predominantly reporting climate change‐induced impacts. No comprehensive study or meta‐analysis has so far examined the possible lack of evidence for changes or shifts at sites where no temperature change is observed. We used an enormous systematic phenological network data set of more than 125 000 observational series of 542 plant and 19 animal species in 21 European countries (1971–2000). Our results showed that 78\% of all leafing, flowering and fruiting records advanced (30\% significantly) and only 3\% were significantly delayed, whereas the signal of leaf colouring/fall is ambiguous. We conclude that previously published results of phenological changes were not biased by reporting or publication predisposition: the average advance of spring/summer was 2.5 days decade
              −1
              in Europe. Our analysis of 254 mean national time series undoubtedly demonstrates that species' phenology is responsive to temperature of the preceding months (mean advance of spring/summer by 2.5 days°C

	abstract = {Two assumptions underlie current models of the geographical ranges of perennial plant species: 1. current ranges are in equilibrium with the prevailing climate, and 2. changes are attributable to changes in macroclimatic factors, including tolerance of winter cold, the duration of the growing season, and water stress during the growing season, rather than to biotic interactions. These assumptions allow model parameters to be estimated from current species ranges. Deterioration of growing conditions due to climate change, e.g. more severe drought, will cause local extinction. However, for many plant species, the predicted climate change of higher minimum temperatures and longer growing seasons means, improved growing conditions. Biogeographical models may under some circumstances predict that a species will become locally extinct, despite improved growing conditions, because they are based on an assumption of equilibrium and this forces the species range to match the species-specific macroclimatic thresholds. We argue that such model predictions should be rejected unless there is evidence either that competition influences the position of the range margins or that a certain physiological mechanism associated with the apparent improvement in growing conditions negatively affects the species performance. We illustrate how a process-based vegetation model can be used to ascertain whether such a physiological cause exists. To avoid potential modelling errors of this type, we propose a method that constrains the scenario predictions of the envelope models by changing the geographical distribution of the dominant plant functional type. Consistent modelling results are very important for evaluating how changes in species areas affect local functional trait diversity and hence ecosystem functioning and resilience, and for inferring the implications for conservation management in the face of climate change.},

	abstract = {Leaf senescence in winter deciduous species signals the transition from the active to the dormant stage. The purpose of leaf senescence is the recovery of nutrients before the leaves fall. Photoperiod and temperature are the main cues controlling leaf senescence in winter deciduous species, with water stress imposing an additional inﬂuence. Photoperiod exerts a strict control on leaf senescence at latitudes where winters are severe and temperature gains importance in the regulation as winters become less severe. On average, climatic warming will delay and drought will advance leaf senescence, but at varying degrees depending on the species. Warming and drought thus have opposite effects on the phenology of leaf senescence, and the impact of climate change will therefore depend on the relative importance of each factor in speciﬁc regions. Warming is not expected to have a strong impact on nutrient proﬁciency although a slower speed of leaf senescence induced by warming could facilitate a more efﬁcient nutrient resorption. Nutrient resorption is less efﬁcient when the leaves senesce prematurely as a consequence of water stress. The overall effects of climate change on nutrient resorption will depend on the contrasting effects of warming and drought. Changes in nutrient resorption and proﬁciency will impact production in the following year, at least in early spring, because the construction of new foliage relies almost exclusively on nutrients resorbed from foliage during the preceding leaf fall. Changes in the phenology of leaf senescence will thus impact carbon uptake, but also ecosystem nutrient cycling, especially if the changes are consequence of water stress.},

              Global warming is changing the timing of photosynthesis, with leaves emerging earlier in spring in the temperate and boreal zones. A longer growing season could mean greater carbon sequestration in forests, but the timing of leaves falling in autumn depends on multiple cues, making it difficult to predict. Zohner

              . investigated how leaf senescence relates to day length, temperature, and early-season photosynthesis across northern forests using remote sensing, ground observations, and experimental data. They found that warming had opposing effects on senescence dates depending on when it occurred: Warmer springs with higher photosynthesis correlated with earlier senescence, wheras warmer temperatures in autumn delayed senescence. Incorporating this shift in knowledge may improve predictions of vegetation response to climate change. —BEL

              INTRODUCTION
              Ongoing climate change is causing rapid shifts in plant phenology, with far-reaching effects on the terrestrial carbon cycle and biodiversity. While advances in spring leaf-out dates in temperate and boreal forests are well documented, the effects on autumn leaf senescence are less clear. This is because leaf senescence is not only affected by temperature but also by day length and vegetation activity early in the season in ways that are poorly understood. Accurately predicting future growing-season lengths and plant photosynthesis requires a better understanding of these interacting mechanisms at broad spatial scales.
            
            
              RATIONALE
              Local observations and experiments suggest that early-season warming, causing earlier spring leaf-out and faster plant development, tends to advance autumn senescence dates. Conversely, late-season warming tends to delay autumn senescence. If true more generally, then climate warming has opposing effects at the start and end of the growing season, with a reversal of effects somewhere in between. To test the generality of the opposing effects of climate warming on leaf senescence in Northern Hemisphere forests, we used satellite, ground, and carbon flux data, as well as controlled experiments.
            
            
              RESULTS
              Our results revealed that warming early and late in the growing season indeed has contrasting effects on leaf senescence, with a reversal occurring after the summer solstice. Across 84\% of the northern forest area, we found that warmer temperatures and increased vegetation activity before the solstice advance the onset of senescence by 1.9 ± 0.1 days per °C, whereas warmer post-solstice temperatures slow the progression of senescence by 2.6 ± 0.1 days per °C. Between 1966 and 2015, the earlier onset of senescence has led to advances of 0.20 ± 0.07 days per year of the date at which autumn temperature starts to drive senescence progression. By contrast, mid-senescence continues to occur slightly later by 0.04 ± 0.01 days per year, leading to a lengthening of the autumnal senescence period.
              In our experiments, warmer pre-solstice temperatures also led to earlier primary growth cessation (bud set), demonstrating that the impact of a warmer pre-solstice period extends beyond leaf development and life span. This highlights the crucial role of overall plant development and sink activity before the summer solstice in determining growing-season length.
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              We have developed a unified explanatory framework for predicting autumn phenology, showing that leaf senescence now tends to begin earlier, because of increased pre-solstice vegetation activity, but progresses more slowly, such that the end of senescence occurs later. The reversal in trees’ responsiveness to warming after the summer solstice likely is triggered by changes in day length and allows them to initiate the physiological processes of leaf senescence and nutrient resorption in a fine-tuned balance between source and sink dynamics. Our results demonstrate the impact of developmental constraints (from cell and tissue growth) on autumn leaf senescence and forest productivity, affecting trends in growing-season length across the entire Northern Hemisphere. These insights provide a better understanding of the changes in growing seasons and carbon uptake of temperate and boreal forests under climate change.
              
                
                  Autumn phenological responses to pre-solstice and post-solstice climate warming.
                  In cold years, slow development before the summer solstice delays the onset of senescence, and cold autumn temperatures accelerate senescence progression. In warm years, fast development before the summer solstice advances senescence onset, and warm autumn temperatures slow senescence progression, delaying the end of senescence.},

	abstract = {Summary
            Leafing‐out of woody plants begins the growing season in temperate forests and is one of the most important drivers of ecosystem processes. There is substantial variation in the timing of leaf‐out, both within and among species, but the leaf development of almost all temperate tree and shrub species is highly sensitive to temperature. As a result, leaf‐out times of temperate forests are valuable for observing the effects of climate change. Analysis of phenology data from around the world indicates that leaf‐out is generally earlier in warmer years than in cooler years and that the onset of leaf‐out has advanced in many locations. Changes in the timing of leaf‐out will affect carbon sequestration, plant–animal interactions, and other essential ecosystem processes. The development of remote sensing methods has expanded the scope of leaf‐out monitoring from the level of an individual plant or forest to an entire region. Meanwhile, historical data have informed modeling and experimental studies addressing questions about leaf‐out timing. For most species, onset of leaf‐out will continue to advance, although advancement may be slowed for some species because of unmet chilling requirements. More information is needed to reduce the uncertainty in predicting the timing of future spring onset.

            The time required for an ecosystem to recover from severe drought is a key component of ecological resilience. The phenology effects on drought recovery are, however, poorly understood. These effects centre on how phenology variations impact biophysical feedbacks, vegetation growth and, ultimately, recovery itself. Using multiple remotely sensed datasets, we found that more than half of ecosystems in mid- and high-latitudinal Northern Hemisphere failed to recover from extreme droughts within a single growing season. Earlier spring phenology in the drought year slowed drought recovery when extreme droughts occurred in mid-growing season. Delayed spring phenology in the subsequent year slowed drought recovery for all vegetation types (with importance of spring phenology ranging from 46\% to 58\%). The phenology effects on drought recovery were comparable to or larger than other well-known postdrought climatic factors. These results strongly suggest that the interactions between vegetation phenology and drought must be incorporated into Earth system models to accurately quantify ecosystem resilience.},

            Most climate change detection and attribution studies have focused on mean or extreme temperature or precipitation, neglecting to explore long-term changes in drought characteristics. Here we provide evidence that anthropogenic forcing has impacted interrelated meteorological drought characteristics. Using SPI and SPEI indices generated from an ensemble of 9 CMIP6 models (using 3 realizations per model), we show that the presence of anthropogenic forcing has increased the drought frequency, maximum drought duration, and maximum drought intensity experienced in large parts of the Americas, Africa, and Asia. Using individual greenhouse gas and anthropogenic aerosol forcings, we also highlight that regional balances between the two major forcings have contributed to the drying patterns detected in our results. Overall, we provide a comprehensive characterization of the influence of anthropogenic forcing on drought characteristics, providing important perspectives on the role of forcings in driving changes in drought events.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing of forests has become increasingly accessible with the use of unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAV), along with deep learning, allowing for repeated high-resolution imagery and the capturing of phenological changes at larger spatial and temporal scales. In temperate forests during autumn, leaf senescence occurs when leaves change colour and drop. However, the influence of leaf senescence in temperate forests on tree species segmentation using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has not yet been evaluated. Here, we acquired highresolution UAV imagery over a temperate forest in Quebec, Canada on seven occasions between May and October 2021. We segmented and labelled 23,000 tree crowns from 14 different classes to train and validate a CNN for each imagery acquisition. The CNN-based segmentation showed the highest F1-score (0.72) at the start of leaf colouring in early September and the lowest F1-score (0.61) at peak fall colouring in early October. The timing of the events occurring during senescence, such as leaf colouring and leaf fall, varied substantially between and within species and according to environmental conditions, leading to higher variability in the remotely sensed signal. Deciduous and evergreen tree species that presented distinctive and less temporally-variable traits be­ tween individuals were better classified. While tree segmentation in a heterogenous forest remains challenging, UAV imagery and deep learning show high potential in mapping tree species. Our results from a temperate forest with strong leaf colour changes during autumn senescence show that the best performance for tree species segmentation occurs at the onset of this colour change.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Late-spring frost (LSF) is a critical factor influencing the functioning of temperate forest ecosystems. Frost damage in the form of canopy defoliation impedes the ability of trees to effectively photosynthesize, thereby reducing tree productivity. In recent decades, LSF frequency has increased across Europe, likely intensified by the effects of climate change. With increasing warming, many deciduous tree species have shifted towards earlier budburst and leaf development. The earlier start of the growing season not only facilitates forest productivity but also lengthens the period during which trees are most susceptible to LSF. Moreover, recent forest transformation efforts in Europe intended to increase forest resilience to climate change have focused on increasing the share of deciduous species in forests. To assess the ability of forests to remain productive under climate change, dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) have proven to be useful tools. Currently, however, most state-of-the-art DVMs do not model processes related to LSF and the associated impacts. Here, we present a novel LSF module for integration with the dynamic vegetation model Lund–Potsdam–Jena General Ecosystem Simulator (LPJ-GUESS). This new model implementation, termed LPJ-GUESS-FROST, provides the ability to directly attribute simulated impacts on forest productivity dynamics to LSF. We use the example of European beech, one of the dominant deciduous species in central Europe, to demonstrate the functioning of our novel LSF module. Using a network of tree-ring observations from past frost events, we show that LPJ-GUESS-FROST can reproduce productivity reductions caused by LSF. Further, to exemplify the effects of including LSF dynamics in DVMs, we run LPJ-GUESS-FROST for a study region in southern Germany for which high-resolution climate observations are available. Here, we show that modeled LSF plays a substantial role in regulating regional net primary production (NPP) and biomass dynamics, emphasizing the need for LSF to be more widely accounted for in DVMs.},

	abstract = {Spring frosts can defoliate trees, reduce canopy carbon assimilation, and alter interspecific competition dynamics. These events may become more common with climate change, but our understanding of the associated ecological impacts is limited by the stochastic nature of their occurrences. In 2020, a late spring frost defoliated oak (
              Quercus
              spp.), but not co-occurring maples (
              Acer
              spp.) across temperate broadleaf forests of the Hudson Highlands in southern New York State, U.S.A. Defoliation impacted 60\% of this region’s forests and delayed full leaf expansion of oaks by ∼17 days. We used this event as an opportunity to advance understanding of how leaf-level physiology, radial growth, and interspecific competition dynamics of mature trees respond to frost-induced defoliation. We quantified leaf-level photosynthetic capacity, stomatal conductance, and water-use efficiency (WUE), as well as basal area increment of defoliated red oak (
              Q. rubra
              ) trees and non-defoliated red maple (
              A. rubrum
              ) trees in 2020 (“defoliation year”) and 2021 (“reference year”). Oak defoliation provided red maple trees with a competitive edge in terms of photosynthetic capacity early in the growing season. However, the second cohort of red oak leaves that developed following defoliation had photosynthetic capacities that were 3–4 times higher than red maple trees by the second half of the growing season, likely facilitated by higher rates of stomatal conductance. The growing season mean photosynthetic capacities for the defoliation year were significantly higher for red oaks than red maples. Red oak basal area increment tended to be higher than red maple during both the defoliation and reference years. For both species basal area increment was significantly higher during the reference year than defoliation year, but the reasons remain unclear. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that temporal patterns of photosynthesis in temperate broadleaf forests are altered by defoliation events, but enhanced photosynthetic capacities of second cohort leaves can reduce the negative effects of delayed leaf expansion and mitigate competitive advantages conferred to undefoliated co-occurring tree species. We suggest that understanding a tree species’ ability to compensate for frost-induced defoliation is essential to accurately predict effects of extreme climate events on tree competition dynamics and ecosystem processes.},

Here, we analyze LSFs between 1959 and 2017 and the resistance strategies of Northern Hemisphere woody species to infer trees’ adaptations for minimizing frost damage to their leaves and to forecast forest vulnerability under the ongoing changes in frost frequencies. Trait values on leaf-out and leaf-freezing resistance come from up to 1,500 temperate and boreal woody species cultivated in common gardens. We find that areas in which LSFs are common, such as eastern North America, harbor tree species with cautious (late-leafing) leaf-out strategies. Areas in which LSFs used to be unlikely, such as broad-leaved forests and shrublands in Europe and Asia, instead harbor opportunistic tree species (quickly reacting to warming air temperatures). LSFs in the latter regions are currently increasing, and given species’ innate resistance strategies, we estimate that ∼35\% of the European and ∼26\% of the Asian temperate forest area, but only ∼10\% of the North American, will experience increasing late-frost damage in the future. Our findings reveal region-specific changes in the spring-frost risk that can inform decision-making in land management, forestry, agriculture, and insurance policy.},

            Heatwaves exert disproportionately strong and sometimes irreversible impacts on forest ecosystems. These impacts remain poorly understood at the tree and species level and across large spatial scales. Here, we investigate the effects of the record-breaking 2018 European heatwave on tree growth and tree water status using a collection of high-temporal resolution dendrometer data from 21 species across 53 sites. Relative to the two preceding years, annual stem growth was not consistently reduced by the 2018 heatwave but stems experienced twice the temporary shrinkage due to depletion of water reserves. Conifer species were less capable of rehydrating overnight than broadleaves across gradients of soil and atmospheric drought, suggesting less resilience toward transient stress. In particular, Norway spruce and Scots pine experienced extensive stem dehydration. Our high-resolution dendrometer network was suitable to disentangle the effects of a severe heatwave on tree growth and desiccation at large-spatial scales in situ, and provided insights on which species may be more vulnerable to climate extremes.},

                    Recent hot droughts in California resulted in ponderosa pine (
                    Pinus ponderosa
                    ) mortality attributed to drought and western pine beetle (WPB,
                    Dendroctonus brevicomis
                    ). While drought alone can cause tree death, direct warming effects on WPB are a contributing factor. Research on WPB generation timing (voltinism), however, is lacking.
                  
                
                
                  We monitored WPB tree attacks and adult emergence timing at two California sites and developed a degree‐day model from field‐observed data. Historical, contemporary, and future temperatures for several California sites were used with the model to examine trends in WPB voltinism.
                
                
                  Field data showed a single summer and an overwinter generation at a northern California site. As summer temperatures increased beyond 1900–1980 averages, the predicted number of full and partial WPB generations by 2021 had increased from {\textasciitilde}2 annual (one summer and one overwinter) generations historically to {\textasciitilde}2.3 at two northern California sites and from {\textasciitilde}2.3 to {\textasciitilde}3.2 at two warmer California sites.
                
                
                  Historical and contemporary data suggest winter warming was not sufficient for an additional generation overwinter. Instead, increases in generations were driven by summer and fall temperatures.
                
                
                  Unconstrained increases in the number of future annual generations will be limited by complex, but not well understood, WPB thermal adaptations. Increased knowledge of temperature‐driven WPB population growth will improve forest vegetation models aimed at predicting ponderosa pine mortality in a changing climate.},

However, very few models are able to predict species distribution accurately, although we know species respond individually to climate change. Here we show, using a process-based model (PHENOFIT), that tree species distributions can be predicted precisely if the biological processes of survival and reproductive success only are incorporated as a function of phenology. These predictions showed great predictive power when tested against present distributions of two North American species ± quaking aspen and sugar maple ± indicating that on a broad scale, the fundamental niche of trees coincides with their realized niche. Phenology is shown here to be a major determinant of plant species range and should therefore be used to assess the consequences of global warming on plant distributions, and the spread of alien plant species.},

Trephor is chisel-shaped for a fast recovery of 2 mm diameter microcores. The cutting tube is inserted into the wood using a hammer and no other accessory is required. Simple technical characteristics allow high quality samples to be collected from both softwood and hardwood species with minimum damage to the sampled trees. Trephor was tested during the 2004 growing season, demonstrating good resistance to wear and tear and mechanical stress.

	abstract = {Monitoring tree phenology is important for understanding ecosystem functioning and for assessing ecosystem responses to climate change. Satellite imagery offers open-access global coverage but is restricted to forest-level analyses, due to its coarse spatial resolution. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery can monitor phenology at the individual tree level by utilizing a centimeterscale resolution. Two research objectives were identiﬁed for this study: (1) to derive phenological metrics at the individual tree level, using various vegetation indices (VIs); and (2) to assess the accuracy of automatic crown delineation in a diverse ecosystem. To achieve this, fourteen multispectral UAV ﬂights were performed, and the ability of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index 2 (EVI2), optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI), and chlorophyll index red-edge (CIre) to model seasonal phenology was assessed. A double logistic model was ﬁtted on the VI observations for each individual tree, to derive the start of season (SOS) and end of season (EOS). Individual tree crowns were delineated automatically using marker-controlled watershed segmentation (MCWS), and the treetops were identiﬁed using a local maximum ﬁlter (LMF). Overall, the automatic segmentation performed well (F-score: 0.79, IoU: 0.58), with higher accuracies in single-species areas, while it underperformed in complex mixed forest structures. All VIs captured a strong seasonal signal for the deciduous trees and derived SOS and EOS estimates consistent with literature and ground observations. General phenological patterns included an early silver birch SOS, a quick beech budburst, and large within-species phenology variations for oak trees. Seasonal VI variation for coniferous evergreen trees was limited, and the resulting phenology estimates proved unreliable. In conclusion, these ﬁndings emphasize the capabilities of UAV imagery for individual tree crown phenology monitoring. However, they also show the difﬁculty of monitoring evergreen phenology with the commonly-used VIs and stress the need for further investigations.},

          , 
            Earlier vegetation greening under climate change raises evapotranspiration and thus lowers spring soil moisture, yet the extent and magnitude of this water deficit persistence into the following summer remain elusive. We provide observational evidence that increased foliage cover over the Northern Hemisphere, during 1982–2011, triggers an additional soil moisture deficit that is further carried over into summer. Climate model simulations independently support this and attribute the driving process to be larger increases in evapotranspiration than in precipitation. This extra soil drying is projected to amplify the frequency and intensity of summer heatwaves. Most feedbacks operate locally, except for a notable teleconnection where extra moisture transpired over Europe is transported to central Siberia. Model results illustrate that this teleconnection offsets Siberian soil moisture losses from local spring greening. Our results highlight that climate change adaptation planning must account for the extra summer water and heatwave stress inherited from warming-induced earlier greening.},

	abstract = {Tree growth is an important indicator of forest health, productivity, and demography. Knowing precisely how trees’ grow within a year, instead of across years, can lead to a ﬁner understanding of the mechanisms that drive these larger patterns. The growing use of dendrometer bands in research forests has only rarely been used to measure growth at resolutions ﬁner than yearly, but intra-annual growth patterns can be observed from dendrometer bands using precision digital calipers and weekly measurements. Here we present a workﬂow to help forest ecologists ﬁt growth models to intra-annual measurements using standard optimization functions provided by the R platform. We explain our protocol, test uncertainty in parameter estimates with respect to sample sizes, extend the optimization protocol to estimate robust lower and upper annual diameter bounds, and discuss potential challenges to optimal ﬁts. We offer R code to implement this workﬂow. We found that starting values and initial optimization routines are critical to ﬁtting the best functional forms. After using a bounded, broad search method, a more focused search algorithm obtained consistent results. To estimate starting and ending annual diameters, we combined the growth function with early and late estimates of beginning and ending growth. Once we ﬁt the functions, we present extension algorithms that estimate periodic reductions in growth, total growth, and present a method of controlling for the shifting allocation to girth during the growth season. We demonstrate that with these extensions, an analysis of growth response to weather (e.g., the water available to a tree) can be derived in a way that is comparable across trees, years, and sites. Thus, this approach, when applied across broader data sets, offers a pathway to build inference about the effects of seasonal weather on growth, size- and light-dependent patterns of growth, species-speciﬁc patterns, and phenology.},

              Projected changes in temperature and drought regime are likely to reduce carbon (C) storage in forests, thereby amplifying rates of climate change. While such reductions are often presumed to be greatest in semi‐arid forests that experience widespread tree mortality, the consequences of drought may also be important in temperate mesic forests of Eastern North America (
              ENA
              ) if tree growth is significantly curtailed by drought. Investigations of the environmental conditions that determine drought sensitivity are critically needed to accurately predict ecosystem feedbacks to climate change. We matched site factors with the growth responses to drought of 10,753 trees across mesic forests of
              ENA
              , representing 24 species and 346 stands, to determine the broad‐scale drivers of drought sensitivity for the dominant trees in
              ENA
              . Here we show that two factors—the timing of drought, and the atmospheric demand for water (i.e., local potential evapotranspiration;
              PET
              )—are stronger drivers of drought sensitivity than soil and stand characteristics. Drought‐induced reductions in tree growth were greatest when the droughts occurred during early‐season peaks in radial growth, especially for trees growing in the warmest, driest regions (i.e., highest
              PET
              ). Further, mean species trait values (rooting depth and ψ
              50
              ) were poor predictors of drought sensitivity, as intraspecific variation in sensitivity was equal to or greater than interspecific variation in 17 of 24 species. From a general circulation model ensemble, we find that future increases in early‐season
              PET
              may exacerbate these effects, and potentially offset gains in C uptake and storage in

              Energy and water limitations of tree growth remain insufficiently understood at large spatiotemporal scales, hindering model representation of interannual or longer-term ecosystem processes. By assessing and statistically scaling the climatic drivers from 2710 tree-ring sites, we identified the boreal and temperate land areas where tree growth during 1930–1960 CE responded positively to temperature (20.8 ± 3.7 Mio km

              ; 96.4 ± 4.1\%), and other parameters. The spatial manifestation of this climate response is determined by latitudinal and altitudinal temperature gradients, indicating that warming leads to geographic shifts in growth limitations. We observed a significant (
              P
              {\textless} 0.001) decrease in temperature response at cold-dry sites between 1930–1960 and 1960–1990 CE, and the total temperature-limited area shrunk by −8.7 ± 0.6 Mio km
              2

	abstract = {The monitoring of forest phenology in a cost-eﬀective manner, at a ﬁne spatial scale and over relatively large areas remains a signiﬁcant challenge. To address this issue, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) appear to be a potential new platform for forest phenology monitoring. This article assesses the potential of UAV data to track the temporal dynamics of spring phenology, from the individual tree to woodland scale, and cross-compare UAV results against ground and satellite observations, in order to better understand characteristics of UAV data and assess potential for use in validation of satellite-derived phenology. A time series of UAV data (5 cm spatial resolution, {\textasciitilde}7 day temporal resolution) were acquired in tandem with an intensive ground campaign during the spring season of 2015 across a 15 ha mixed woodland. Phenophase transition dates were estimated at an individual tree-level using UAV time series of Normalized Diﬀerence Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Green Chromatic Coordinate (GCC) and validated against visual observations of tree phenology. UAV-derived start of season dates could be predicted with an accuracy of {\textless} 1 week. The analysis was scaled to a plot level, where ground (visual assessment and understorey development), UAV and Landsat metrics were compared, indicating UAV data is eﬀective for tracking canopy phenology, as opposed to ecosystem dynamics detected by satellites. The UAV data were used to automatically map phenological events for individual trees across the whole woodland, demonstrating that contrasting canopy phenological events can occur within the extent of a single Landsat pixel. This, and a large temporal gap in the Landsat series, accounted for the poor relationships found between UAV- and Landsat-derived phenometrics (R2 {\textless} 0.50) in this study. An opportunity is now available to track very ﬁne scale land surface changes over contiguous vegetation communities, providing information which could improve characterization of vegetation phenology at multiple scales.},

Phenological processes have been studied from landscape to global scales using Earth observing satellite data, and at local scale by in situ surveys of individual plants. Now, data acquired from multi-spectral sensors on drone platforms provide ﬂexible opportunities for monitoring phenology from individual plants to small ecosystem scales efﬁciently, allowing community and species level information to be derived. We captured a time-series of drone-acquired normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data with a multi-spectral sensor (Parrot Sequoia, (Parrot, France)) over a highly heterogeneous ecosystem in Cornwall, UK, during a period of spring green-up. We monitored NDVI trajectories at the individual crown and species’ level. For deciduous crowns, we derived metrics representative of spring phenological stages: Start-of-spring (SOS), middle-ofspring green-up (MOG) and start-of-peak greenness (SOP) using a logistic function. While the exact timing of SOS, MOG and SOP appeared susceptible to understorey effects and saturation of the NDVI, relative timing of green-up for a subset of species was plausible in relation to phenological observations from an extended geographic region and in situ plant area index (PAI) measurements. In evergreen vegetation (Pinus spp.) subtle changes were also detected through the growing season. The impact of illumination differences was analysed for image pairs during leaf-off and leaf-on conditions. While signiﬁcant, these effects were small (mean absolute NDVI deviation of up to 0.034 for leaf-off, 0.013 for leaf-on conditions), meaning that data captured under both constant direct and diffuse irradiance conditions can be used together and that cloudy conditions should not lead to data gaps. We conclude that the capability of drone-mounted multi-spectral instruments for spatio-temporal characterization of crown-level phenology shows great promise for improving the understanding of intra- and inter-species differences in strategy, and offers an efﬁcient means of doing so over areas of a few hectares.},

Yet, some process-based species distribution models have been able to simulate plants and insects distribution at a global scale. These models strongly rely on the completion of the annual cycle of the species and therefore on their accomplished phenology. In particular, they have shown that the northern limit of species' ranges appears to be caused mainly by the inability to undergo full fruit maturation, while the southern limit appears to be caused by the inability to flower or unfold leaves owing to a lack of chilling temperatures that are necessary to break bud dormancy. I discuss here why phenology is a key adaptive trait in shaping species distribution using mostly examples from plant species, which have been the most documented. After discussing how phenology is involved in fitness and why it is an adaptive trait susceptible to evolve quickly in changing climate conditions, I describe how phenology is related to fitness in species distribution process-based models and discuss the fate of species under climate change scenarios using model projections and experimental or field studies from the literature.},

	abstract = {In tree species native to temperate and boreal regions, the activity-dormancy cycle is an important adaptive trait both for survival and growth. We discuss recent research on mechanisms controlling the overlapping developmental processes that deﬁne the activity-dormancy cycle, including cessation of apical growth, bud development, induction, maintenance and release of dormancy, and bud burst. The cycle involves an extensive reconﬁguration of metabolism. Environmental control of the activity-dormancy cycle is based on perception of photoperiodic and temperature signals, reﬂecting adaptation to prevailing climatic conditions. Several molecular actors for control of growth cessation have been identiﬁed, with the CO/FT regulatory network and circadian clock having important coordinating roles in control of growth and dormancy. Other candidate regulators of bud set, dormancy and bud burst have been identiﬁed, such as dormancy-associated MADS-box factors, but their exact roles remain to be discovered. Epigenetic mechanisms also appear to factor in control of the activitydormancy cycle. Despite evidence for gibberellins as negative regulators in growth cessation, and ABA and ethylene in bud formation, understanding of the roles that plant growth regulators play in controlling the activity-dormancy cycle is still very fragmentary. Finally, some of the challenges for further research in bud dormancy are discussed.},

	abstract = {Accurate predictions of spring plant phenology with climate change are critical for projections of growing seasons, plant communities and a number of ecosystem services, including carbon storage. Progress towards prediction, however, has been slow because the major cues known to drive phenology – temperature (including winter chilling and spring forcing) and photoperiod – generally covary in nature and may interact, making accurate predictions of plant responses to climate change complex and nonlinear. Alternatively, recent work suggests many species may be dominated by one cue, which would make predictions much simpler.},

	abstract = {To investigate the impact of recent climatic changes on the plant development in Europe, this study uses phenological data of the International Phenological Gardens for the period 1969–1998. For this study, the leaﬁng dates of four tree species (Betula pubescens, Prunus avium, Sorbus aucuparia and Ribes alpinum) were combined in an annual leaf unfolding index to deﬁne the beginning of growing season. The end of growing season was deﬁned using the average leaf fall of B. pubescens, P. avium, Salix smithiana and R. alpinum. A nearly Europe-wide warming in the early spring (February–April) over the last 30 years (1969–1998) led to an earlier beginning of growing season by 8 days. The observed trends in the onset of spring corresponded well with changes in air temperature and circulation ( North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAO-index)) across Europe. In late winter and early spring, the positive phase of NAO increased clearly, leading to prevailing westerly winds and thus to higher temperatures in the period February–April. Since the end of the 1980s the changes in circulation, air temperature and the beginning of spring time were striking. The investigation showed that a warming in the early spring (February–April) by 1◦C causes an advance in the beginning of growing season of 7 days. The observed extension of growing season was mainly the result of an earlier onset of spring. An increase of mean annual air temperature by 1◦C led to an extension of 5 days. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Climate change is profoundly affecting phenology, especially in the Northern Hemisphere. Nevertheless, how tree radial growth responds to phenological shifts remains to be explored. It is necessary to analyze the specific response process of tree growth to phenology. In this study, 61 tree-ring chronologies from Central Asia were used to analyze the effects of phenological shifts on tree radial growth. Based on previous studies and hydro­ thermal characteristics, we divided the study area into two parts, with 49◦ north latitude as the boundary. The results of the model-based simulation indicated an obvious advance to the start of growing season (SoGS) in the period from 1959 to 2010/2016. Correlation analyses showed that there were significant negative correlations between the SoGS and radial growth in the north of the study area but not in the south. Path analyses indicated that radial growth between north and south did not respond consistently to the earlier SoGS. In the north, radial growth mainly benefited from the alleviation of low temperature limitations, thereby elevating the cumulative growth rate. But in the dry south, aridity stress in the early growing season counteracted the positive effect of temperature on tree radial growth through decreasing the cumulative growth rate. In general, we determined that an earlier SoGS influences tree radial growth by regulating the cumulative growth rate. This study provides a theoretical basis for promoting the accurate assessment of carbon sink potential on a larger scale and for pre­ dicting forest dynamics.},

	abstract = {Plant phenological events are influenced by climate factors such as temperature and rainfall. To evaluate phenological responses to water availability in a Spring Heath-Pine wood (Erico-Pinetum typicum), the focus of this study was to determine intra-annual dynamics of apical and lateral growth of co-occurring early successional Larix decidua and Pinus sylvestris and late successional Picea abies exposed to drought. The effect of reduced plant water availability on growth phenology was investigated by conducting a rainfall exclusion experiment. Timing of key phenological dates (onset, maximum rate, end, duration) of growth processes were compared among species at the rain-sheltered and control plot during 2011 and 2012. Shoot and needle elongation were monitored on lateral branches in the canopy at c. 16 m height and radial growth was recorded by automatic dendrometers at c. 1.3 m height of {\textgreater} 120 yr old trees. Different sequences in aboveground growth phenology were detected among the three species under the same growing conditions. While onset of radial growth in April through early May was considerably preceded by onset of needle growth in Larix decidua (5 - 6 weeks) and shoot growth in Pinus sylvestris (c. 3 weeks), it occurred quite simultaneously with onset of shoot growth in Picea abies. Low water availability had a minor impact on onset of aboveground growth, which is related to utilization of stored water, but caused premature cessation of aboveground growth. At the control plot mean growing season length was 130 days in Pinus sylvestris, 95 days in Larix decidua and 73 days in Picea abies supporting the hypothesis that early successional species are resource expenders, while late successional species are more efficient in utilizing resources and develop safer life strategies. High synchronicity found in culmination of radial growth in late spring (mid-May through early June) prior to occurrence of more favourable environmental conditions in summer might indicate sink competition for carbohydrates to belowground organs. This is supported by completion of apical growth in mid June in all species, except for needle growth of Pinus sylvestris, which lasted until early August. Phenological observations of conifers exposed to drought revealed that tree water status early during the growing season determines total annual aboveground growth and besides temperature, species-specific endogenous and/or environmental factors (most likely photoperiod and/or different threshold temperatures) are involved in controlling apical and lateral growth resumption after winter dormancy.},

Current monitoring methods involve ground measurements, requiring extensive cost, time and labor. Advances in drone remote sensing and computer vision offer great potential for mapping individual trees from aerial imagery at broad-scale. Large pre-trained vision models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), represent a particularly compelling choice given limited labeled data. In this work, we compare methods leveraging SAM for the task of automatic tree crown instance segmentation in high resolution drone imagery in three use cases: 1) boreal plantations, 2) temperate forests and 3) tropical forests. We also study the integration of elevation data into models, in the form of Digital Surface Model (DSM) information, which can readily be obtained at no additional cost from RGB drone imagery. We present BalSAM, a model leveraging SAM and DSM information, which shows potential over other methods, particularly in the context of plantations. We find that methods using SAM out-of-the-box do not outperform a custom Mask R-CNN, even with well-designed prompts. However, efficiently tuning SAM end-to-end and integrating DSM information are both promising avenues for tree crown instance segmentation models.},

Still, several challenges can make the problem difficult, including the varying spectral signature of different trees, lack of sufficient labelled data, and geometrical occlusions. In this paper, we address the tree segmentation problem using multispectral imagery. While we carry out large-scale experiments on several deep learning architectures using various spectral input combinations, we also attempt to explore whether hand-crafted spectral vegetation indices can improve the performance of deep learning models in the segmentation of trees. Our experiments include benchmarking a variety of multispectral remote sensing image sets, deep semantic segmentation architectures, and various spectral bands as inputs, including a number of hand-crafted spectral vegetation indices. From our large-scale experiments, we draw several useful conclusions. One particularly important conclusion is that, with no additional computation burden, combining different categories of multispectral vegetation indices, such as NVDI, ARVI, and SAVI, within a single three-channel input, and using the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation architectures, tree segmentation accuracy can be improved under certain conditions, compared to using high-resolution visible and/or nearinfrared input.},

	abstract = {Tropical forests are a major component of the global carbon cycle and home to two-thirds of terrestrial species. Upper-canopy trees store the majority of forest carbon and can be vulnerable to drought events and storms. Monitoring their growth and mortality is essential to understanding forest resilience to climate change, but in the context of forest carbon storage, large trees are underrepresented in traditional ﬁeld surveys, so estimates are poorly constrained. Aerial photographs provide spectral and textural information to discriminate between tree crowns in diverse, complex tropical canopies, potentially opening the door to landscape monitoring of large trees. Here we describe a new deep convolutional neural network method, Detectree2, which builds on the Mask R-CNN computer vision framework to recognize the irregular edges of individual tree crowns from airborne RGB imagery. We trained and evaluated this model with 3797 manually delineated tree crowns at three sites in Malaysian Borneo and one site in French Guiana. As an example application, we combined the delineations with repeat lidar surveys (taken between 3 and 6 years apart) of the four sites to estimate the growth and mortality of upper-canopy trees. Detectree2 delineated 65 000 upper-canopy trees across 14 km2 of aerial images. The skill of the automatic method in delineating unseen test trees was good (F1 score = 0.64) and for the tallest category of trees was excellent (F1 score = 0.74). As predicted from previous ﬁeld studies, we found that growth rate declined with tree height and tall trees had higher mortality rates than intermediate-size trees. Our approach demonstrates that deep learning methods can automatically segment trees in widely accessible RGB imagery. This tool (provided as an open-source Python package) has many potential applications in forest ecology and conservation, from estimating carbon stocks to monitoring forest phenology and restoration.Python package available to install at https://github.com/PatBall1/ Detectree2.},

	abstract = {In deciduous trees growing in temperate forests, bud break and growth in spring must rely on intrinsic carbon (C) reserves. Yet it is unclear whether growth and C storage occur simultaneously, and whether starch C in branches is sufficient for refoliation. To test in situ the relationships between growth, phenology and C utilization, we monitored stem growth, leaf phenology and stem and branch nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) dynamics in three deciduous species: Carpinus betulus L., Fagus sylvatica L. and Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl. To quantify the role of NSC in C investment into growth, a C balance approach was applied. Across the three species, {\textgreater}95\% of branchlet starch was consumed during bud break, confirming the importance of C reserves for refoliation in spring. The C balance calculation showed that 90\% of the C investment in foliage (7.0–10.5 kg tree−1 and 5–17 times the C needed for annual stem growth) was explained by simultaneous branchlet starch degradation. Carbon reserves were recovered sooner than expected, after leaf expansion, in parallel with stem growth. Carpinus had earlier leaf phenology (by ∼25 days) but delayed cambial growth (by ∼15 days) than Fagus and Quercus, the result of a competitive strategy to flush early, while having lower NSC levels.},

	abstract = {Climate warming is expected to lengthen the growing season of tree species and enhance radial growth rates. Alternatively, a longer growing season could not lead to improved radial growth if wood production depends more on growth rate than on growing season length. We test these ideas by comparing leaf phenology data and the estimated start and end dates of wood formation predicted by the VS-Lite growth model. We analyzed longterm series of leaf unfolding and fall dates and reconstructed radial growth of two pine species under contrasting climatic conditions: Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) in a Russian boreal site and Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis) in a Spanish Mediterranean site. On average, leaf onset occurred in days 99 and 163 in P. halepensis and P. sylvestris, respectively, about 40 days earlier than the estimated start date of wood formation. The onset of leaf unfolding advanced 2.1 days per decade in P. sylvestris in response to warmer May temperatures. Radial growth was enhanced by warm-wet spring-summer conditions in P. sylvestris and by wet soil conditions from prior winter up to current summer in P. halepensis. In this species the growing season length and the radial growth rate were not coupled because the growing season length shortened during cool-wet periods whereas growth rates increased. In P. sylvestris leaf onset was delayed during years with low growth rates suggesting a potential coupling between warmer spring conditions, earlier leaf onset and enhanced growth whenever soil water content is high enough. Overall, we show that longer growing seasons do not necessarily imply higher radial growth rates.},

Disentangling the influence of temperature, precipitation and soil moisture content (AWR) on the forest productivity remains an important research area. We analyzed the impact of climate variability on the leaf phenology (10 sample trees) and radial growth (17 sample trees) of European beech ( L.). The study was conducted on 130-year-old European beech trees growing in a temperate forest stand in the Czech Republic. Detailed 20-year phenological monitoring was performed at the study site (1992–2011). As expected, leaf phenological events were mainly driven by the growing season temperatures. Leaf unfolding was highly affected positively by spring temperatures and the top-layer (to 40 cm) AWR in March. The correlation of tree-ring width with the interpolated climate data was positive significant for the growing season AWR and precipitation signal. Furthermore, the water availability in the top soil layer was found to be an important predictor of tree growth and extremely low growth occurrence. The extended phenological growing season, which was caused by a temperature increase, was not followed by an increased tree-ring width. The examined relationships point out the significance of the water availability in the top soil layer in European beech stands.

              A reliable assessment of forest carbon sequestration depends on our understanding of wood ecophysiology. Within a forest, trees exhibit different timings and rates of growth during wood formation. However, their relationships with wood anatomical traits remain partially unresolved. This study evaluated the intra-annual individual variability in growth traits in balsam fir [
              Abies balsamea
               (L.) Mill.]. We collected wood microcores weekly from April to October 2018 from 27 individuals in Quebec (Canada) and prepared anatomical sections to assess wood formation dynamics and their relationships with the anatomical traits of the wood cells. Xylem developed in a time window ranging from 44 to 118 days, producing between 8 and 79 cells. Trees with larger cell production experienced a longer growing season, with an earlier onset and later ending of wood formation. On average, each additional xylem cell lengthened the growing season by 1 day. Earlywood production explained 95\% of the variability in xylem production. More productive individuals generated a higher proportion of earlywood and cells with larger sizes. Trees with a longer growing season produced more cells but not more biomass in the wood. Lengthening the growing season driven by climate change may not lead to enhanced carbon sequestration from wood production.},

Here we describe and synthesize data sets and methodologies to quantify the ﬁve major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO2 emissions (EFOS) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land-use change (ELUC), mainly deforestation, are based on land use and land-use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly, and its growth rate (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO2 sink (SOCEAN) is estimated with global ocean biogeochemistry models and observation-based data products. The terrestrial CO2 sink (SLAND) is estimated with dynamic global vegetation models. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (BIM), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as ±1σ .},

	abstract = {Concerns are rising about the capacity of species to adapt quickly enough to climate change. In long-lived organisms such as trees, genetic adaptation is slow, and how much phenotypic plasticity can help them cope with climate change remains largely unknown. Here, we assess whether, where and when phenological plasticity is and will be adaptive in three major European tree species. We use a process-based species distribution model, parameterized with extensive ecological data, and manipulate plasticity to suppress phenological variations due to interannual, geographical and trend climate variability, under current and projected climatic conditions. We show that phenological plasticity is not always adaptive and mostly affects ﬁtness at the margins of the species’ distribution and climatic niche. Under current climatic conditions, phenological plasticity constrains the northern range limit of oak and beech and the southern range limit of pine. Under future climatic conditions, phenological plasticity becomes strongly adaptive towards the trailing edges of beech and oak, but severely constrains the range and niche of pine. Our results call for caution when interpreting geographical variation in trait means as adaptive, and strongly point towards species distribution models explicitly taking phenotypic plasticity into account when forecasting species distribution under climate change scenarios.},
