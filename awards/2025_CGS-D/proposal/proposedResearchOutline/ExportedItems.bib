	abstract = {A delay of leaf senescence resulting from variable fall climate may allow for additional nutrient resorption, and storage within reserve organs. Autumn leaves and reserve organs ({\textless}1 year shoots, {\textgreater}1 year shoots, stem above and below the graft union, the tap root, and fine roots) during dormancy of young peach trees were evaluated following warmer fall temperatures and limited soil moisture on two cultivars (‘Scarletprince’ and ‘Autumnprince’ both on GuardianTM rootstock) over two seasons. Four treatments were established for the two cultivars: (1) well-watered trees (100\% ETc needs) in ambient outdoor temperatures; (2) water deficient trees (50\% ETc needs) in ambient outdoor temperatures; (3) well-watered trees grown within a greenhouse; and (4) water deficient trees within a greenhouse. The greenhouse environment was on average 5°C warmer than the ambient outdoor temperature. Senescence was delayed on greenhouse-grown trees both years with leaf number and area similar in the greenhouse and outdoor environments prior to senescence. Across leaf samples, leaf nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were lower within delayed senescence tree leaves while potassium was lower in leaves experiencing normal senescence. During dormancy, multiple reserve organs showed higher nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in trees with delayed senescence than normal senescence and similar increases were observed in water-deficient trees compared to well-watered trees. Phosphorus and potassium concentrations were also higher in multiple reserve organs within ‘Autumnprince’ trees compared to ‘Scarletprince’ trees. This study suggests variable climate conditions of increased temperatures or reduced soil moisture during autumn resulting in delayed senescence influence the process of nutrient resorption and increase nutrient storage within reserve organs.},

	abstract = {The effects of winter chilling, spring forcing temperature, and photoperiod on spring phenology are well known for many European and North American species, but the environmental cues that regulate the spring phenology of East Asian species have not yet been thoroughly investigated. Here, we conducted a growth chamber experiment to test the effects of chilling (controlled by different lengths of exposure to natural chilling conditions), forcing temperature (12, 15, or 18°C) and photoperiod (14 or 10 h) on first flowering date (FFD) of six woody species (three shrubs and three trees) native to East Asia. The three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) separately for each species showed that the effects of chilling and forcing temperature were significant for almost all species (P {\textless} 0.05). Averaged over all chilling and photoperiod treatments, the number of days until FFD decreased by 2.3–36.1 days when the forcing temperature increased by 3°C. More chilling days reduced the time to FFD by 0.7–26 days, when averaged over forcing and photoperiod treatments. A longer photoperiod could advance the FFD by 1.0–5.6 days, on average, but its effect was only significant for two species (including one tree and one shrub). The effects of forcing temperature and photoperiod interacted with chilling for half of the studied species, being stronger in the low chilling than high chilling treatment. These results could be explained by the theory and model of growing degree-days (GDD). Increased exposure to chilling coupled to a longer photoperiod reduced the GDD requirement for FFD, especially when plants grew under low chilling conditions. However, shrubs (except Viburnum dilatatum) had lower chilling and heat requirements than trees, suggesting that, by leafing out sooner, they engage in a more opportunistic life strategy to maximize their growing season, especially before canopy closure from trees' foliage. Our results confirmed the varying effects of these three cues on the flowering phenology of woody species native to East Asia. In future climate change scenarios, spring warming is likely to advance the spring phenology of those woody species, although the reduced chilling and shorter photoperiod may partly offset this spring warming effect.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing provides spatially and temporally continuous measures of forest reflectance, and vegetation indices calculated from satellite data can be useful for monitoring climate change impacts on forest tree phenology. Monitoring of evergreen coniferous forest is more difficult than monitoring of deciduous forest, as the new buds only account for a small proportion of the green biomass, and the shoot elongation process is relatively slow. In this study, we have analyzed data from 186 coniferous monitoring sites in Sweden covering boreal, southern-boreal, and boreo-nemoral conditions. Our objective was to examine the possibility to track seasonal changes in coniferous forests by time-series of MODIS eight-day vegetation indices, testing the coherence between satellite monitored vegetation indices (VI) and temperature dependent phenology. The relationships between two vegetation indices (NDVI and WDRVI) and four phenological indicators (length of snow season, modeled onset of vegetation period, tree cold hardiness level and timing of budburst) were analyzed. The annual curves produced by two curve fitting methods for smoothening of seasonal changes in NDVI and WDRVI were to a large extent characterized by the occurrence of snow, producing stable seasonal oscillations in the northern part and irregular curves with less pronounced annual amplitude in the southern part of the country. Measures based on threshold values of the VI-curves, commonly used for determining the timing of different phenological phases, were not applicable for Swedish coniferous forests. Evergreen vegetation does not have a sharp increase in greenness during spring, and the melting of snow can influence the vegetation indices at the timing of budburst in boreal forests. However, the interannual variation in VI-values for specific eight-day periods was correlated with the phenological indicators. This relation can be used for satellite monitoring of potential climate change impacts on northern coniferous spring phenology.},

Prior to planting, nursery-produced seedlings were placed in cold storage (−3°C) and root growth potential (RGP) and total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) root reserves were tested at 0, 10, 75 and after 150 (container) and 190 days (BR) of storage. Both container and BR stock had much lower root to shoot ratios (RSRs) and root carbohydrate reserves compared to UR seedlings after 170 days. During storage, root reserves in container stock declined faster than in the BR and UR seedlings. RGP in all nursery stock was the highest after 75 days of storage, while longer storage resulted in shoot dieback and reduced root growth. After the first growing season, UR seedlings were one tenth the size of the nursery stock; however, in the second growing season they had no stem dieback and grew twice the height and stem diameter. The higher RSRs and root reserves in the UR seedlings was likely caused by early bud set in its first year of growth. This suggests that inducing bud set earlier in the growing regime might allow seedlings to increase root mass and carbohydrate reserves.},

	abstract = {Increasingly, trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) is being planted in stressful situations such as forest land reclamation, afforestation and forest restoration in North America. This is due to its fast potential for growth and high resiliency, but its indeterminate growth strategy provides a special challenge in creating suitable planting stock for these sites. Clues from naturally established aspen seedlings suggest that root total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) reserves and root:shoot ratio could be strongly related to subsequent seedling establishment and growth. Carbon allocation in plants is generally partitioned between reserve accumulation and growth and development. Under conditions in controlled nurseries, the allocation of carbohydrates to reserves could be manipulated in order to produce seedlings designed for specific environmental conditions. To manipulate seedling characteristics we attempted to induce premature bud set during nursery culture while allowing continued photosynthesis. Treatments included applying different fertilizer regimes, light intensities, reducing photoperiod and use of a shoot growth inhibitor. The shoot growth inhibitor was the most reliable treatment and resulted in complete bud set, while blackout was successful only when seedlings were grown outside. Low nutrient treatments also resulted in early bud set; however, leaves were abscised much earlier. There was a distinct trade-off between growth and reserve accumulation with the late bud set. A longer period of height growth reduced root and total TNC reserves, while early bud set allowed for continued photosynthesis and produced the highest levels of root and total TNC reserves in seedlings. Increased TNC reserves of aspen planting stock was positively related to height growth after outplanting, with root TNC reserves as high as 33\% of dry weight and root:shoot ratios greater than 2 associated with the best growth.},

	abstract = {Nutrient loading of nursery seedling stock of species with an indeterminate growth strategy is challenging and poorly understood. Here, we explore the use of two potential techniques for nutrient loading of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) seedlings: (1) exponential fertilization and (2) early shoot growth termination in order to divert assimilated nutrients and carbon to storage rather than to growth. In the first study, aspen seedlings were treated with either exponential or constant fertilization rates, both of which supplied the same amount of nutrients over the growing season. Exponential fertilization resulted in overall poor planting stock form (stunted seedling growth and weak root development) and produced only marginal improvements of nutrient status. As a result, the exponential fertilization regime studied cannot be recommended as a treatment for aspen seedlings. In the second study we treated seedlings with a 2 × 2 factorial combination of fertilization and shoot growth inhibitor (SGI) applications with the fertilizer treatments varying in terms of mid-season fertilizer concentrations. Seedlings with SGI application had much higher tissue nutrient and carbon reserve concentrations than seedlings without a SGI application. In addition, nutrient uptake appeared to be more efficient in SGI treated seedlings, which could potentially result in significant reductions of nutrient application rates during aspen seedling production in nurseries. Overall, early shoot growth termination using a SGI appears to be an effective technique to produce nutrient loaded aspen seedlings.},

	abstract = {Plant phenology, the annually recurring sequence of plant developmental stages, is important for plant functioning and ecosystem services and their biophysical and biogeochemical feedbacks to the climate system. Plant phenology depends on temperature, and the current rapid climate change has revived interest in understanding and modeling the responses of plant phenology to the warming trend and the consequences thereof for ecosystems. Here, we review recent progresses in plant phenology and its interactions with climate change. Focusing on the start (leaf unfolding) and end (leaf coloring) of plant growing seasons, we show that the recent rapid expansion in ground- and remote sensing- based phenology data acquisition has been highly beneficial and has supported major advances in plant phenology research. Studies using multiple data sources and methods generally agree on the trends of advanced leaf unfolding and delayed leaf coloring due to climate change, yet these trends appear to have decelerated or even reversed in recent years. Our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the plant phenology responses to climate warming is still limited. The interactions between multiple drivers complicate the modeling and prediction of plant phenology changes. Furthermore, changes in plant phenology have important implications for ecosystem carbon cycles and ecosystem feedbacks to climate, yet the quantification of such impacts remains challenging. We suggest that future studies should primarily focus on using new observation tools to improve the understanding of tropical plant phenology, on improving process-based phenology modeling, and on the scaling of phenology from species to landscape-level.},

Observational studies have related current and historical temperatures to phenological shifts, but experimental evidence is sparse, particularly for autumn responses. A 4 year ﬁeld experiment exposed four deciduous forest species from contrasting climates (Liquidambar styraciﬂua, Quercus rubra, Populus grandidentata, and Betula alleghaniensis) to air temperatures 2 and 4 °C above ambient controls, using temperature-controlled open top chambers. Impacts of year-round warming on bud burst (BB), senescence, and abscission were evaluated in relation to thermal provenance. Leaves emerged earlier in all species by an average of 4–9 days at +2 °C and 6–14 days at +4 °C. Magnitude of advance varied with species and year, but was larger for the ﬁrst 2 °C increment than for the second. Effect of warming increased with early BB, favoring Liquidambar, but even BB of northern species advanced, despite temperatures exceeding those of the realized niche. Treatment differences in BB were inadequately explained by temperature sums alone. In autumn, chlorophyll was retained an average of 4 and 7 days longer in +2 and +4 °C treatments, respectively, and abscission delayed by 8 and 13 days. Growing seasons in the warmer atmospheres averaged 5–18 days (E2) and 6–28 days (E4) longer, according to species, with the least impact in Quercus. Results are compared with a 16 years record of canopy onset and offset in a nearby upland deciduous forest, where BB showed similar responsiveness to spring temperatures (2–4 days °CÀ1). Offset dates in the stand tracked August–September temperatures, except when late summer drought caused premature senescence. The common garden-like experiment provides evidence that warming alone extends the growing season, at both ends, even if stand-level impacts may be complicated by variation in other environmental factors.},

	abstract = {Leaf senescence in winter deciduous species signals the transition from the active to the dormant stage. The purpose of leaf senescence is the recovery of nutrients before the leaves fall. Photoperiod and temperature are the main cues controlling leaf senescence in winter deciduous species, with water stress imposing an additional inﬂuence. Photoperiod exerts a strict control on leaf senescence at latitudes where winters are severe and temperature gains importance in the regulation as winters become less severe. On average, climatic warming will delay and drought will advance leaf senescence, but at varying degrees depending on the species. Warming and drought thus have opposite effects on the phenology of leaf senescence, and the impact of climate change will therefore depend on the relative importance of each factor in speciﬁc regions. Warming is not expected to have a strong impact on nutrient proﬁciency although a slower speed of leaf senescence induced by warming could facilitate a more efﬁcient nutrient resorption. Nutrient resorption is less efﬁcient when the leaves senesce prematurely as a consequence of water stress. The overall effects of climate change on nutrient resorption will depend on the contrasting effects of warming and drought. Changes in nutrient resorption and proﬁciency will impact production in the following year, at least in early spring, because the construction of new foliage relies almost exclusively on nutrients resorbed from foliage during the preceding leaf fall. Changes in the phenology of leaf senescence will thus impact carbon uptake, but also ecosystem nutrient cycling, especially if the changes are consequence of water stress.},

	abstract = {Summary
            Leafing‐out of woody plants begins the growing season in temperate forests and is one of the most important drivers of ecosystem processes. There is substantial variation in the timing of leaf‐out, both within and among species, but the leaf development of almost all temperate tree and shrub species is highly sensitive to temperature. As a result, leaf‐out times of temperate forests are valuable for observing the effects of climate change. Analysis of phenology data from around the world indicates that leaf‐out is generally earlier in warmer years than in cooler years and that the onset of leaf‐out has advanced in many locations. Changes in the timing of leaf‐out will affect carbon sequestration, plant–animal interactions, and other essential ecosystem processes. The development of remote sensing methods has expanded the scope of leaf‐out monitoring from the level of an individual plant or forest to an entire region. Meanwhile, historical data have informed modeling and experimental studies addressing questions about leaf‐out timing. For most species, onset of leaf‐out will continue to advance, although advancement may be slowed for some species because of unmet chilling requirements. More information is needed to reduce the uncertainty in predicting the timing of future spring onset.

            The time required for an ecosystem to recover from severe drought is a key component of ecological resilience. The phenology effects on drought recovery are, however, poorly understood. These effects centre on how phenology variations impact biophysical feedbacks, vegetation growth and, ultimately, recovery itself. Using multiple remotely sensed datasets, we found that more than half of ecosystems in mid- and high-latitudinal Northern Hemisphere failed to recover from extreme droughts within a single growing season. Earlier spring phenology in the drought year slowed drought recovery when extreme droughts occurred in mid-growing season. Delayed spring phenology in the subsequent year slowed drought recovery for all vegetation types (with importance of spring phenology ranging from 46\% to 58\%). The phenology effects on drought recovery were comparable to or larger than other well-known postdrought climatic factors. These results strongly suggest that the interactions between vegetation phenology and drought must be incorporated into Earth system models to accurately quantify ecosystem resilience.},

            Most climate change detection and attribution studies have focused on mean or extreme temperature or precipitation, neglecting to explore long-term changes in drought characteristics. Here we provide evidence that anthropogenic forcing has impacted interrelated meteorological drought characteristics. Using SPI and SPEI indices generated from an ensemble of 9 CMIP6 models (using 3 realizations per model), we show that the presence of anthropogenic forcing has increased the drought frequency, maximum drought duration, and maximum drought intensity experienced in large parts of the Americas, Africa, and Asia. Using individual greenhouse gas and anthropogenic aerosol forcings, we also highlight that regional balances between the two major forcings have contributed to the drying patterns detected in our results. Overall, we provide a comprehensive characterization of the influence of anthropogenic forcing on drought characteristics, providing important perspectives on the role of forcings in driving changes in drought events.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing of forests has become increasingly accessible with the use of unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAV), along with deep learning, allowing for repeated high-resolution imagery and the capturing of phenological changes at larger spatial and temporal scales. In temperate forests during autumn, leaf senescence occurs when leaves change colour and drop. However, the influence of leaf senescence in temperate forests on tree species segmentation using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has not yet been evaluated. Here, we acquired highresolution UAV imagery over a temperate forest in Quebec, Canada on seven occasions between May and October 2021. We segmented and labelled 23,000 tree crowns from 14 different classes to train and validate a CNN for each imagery acquisition. The CNN-based segmentation showed the highest F1-score (0.72) at the start of leaf colouring in early September and the lowest F1-score (0.61) at peak fall colouring in early October. The timing of the events occurring during senescence, such as leaf colouring and leaf fall, varied substantially between and within species and according to environmental conditions, leading to higher variability in the remotely sensed signal. Deciduous and evergreen tree species that presented distinctive and less temporally-variable traits be­ tween individuals were better classified. While tree segmentation in a heterogenous forest remains challenging, UAV imagery and deep learning show high potential in mapping tree species. Our results from a temperate forest with strong leaf colour changes during autumn senescence show that the best performance for tree species segmentation occurs at the onset of this colour change.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Late-spring frost (LSF) is a critical factor influencing the functioning of temperate forest ecosystems. Frost damage in the form of canopy defoliation impedes the ability of trees to effectively photosynthesize, thereby reducing tree productivity. In recent decades, LSF frequency has increased across Europe, likely intensified by the effects of climate change. With increasing warming, many deciduous tree species have shifted towards earlier budburst and leaf development. The earlier start of the growing season not only facilitates forest productivity but also lengthens the period during which trees are most susceptible to LSF. Moreover, recent forest transformation efforts in Europe intended to increase forest resilience to climate change have focused on increasing the share of deciduous species in forests. To assess the ability of forests to remain productive under climate change, dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) have proven to be useful tools. Currently, however, most state-of-the-art DVMs do not model processes related to LSF and the associated impacts. Here, we present a novel LSF module for integration with the dynamic vegetation model Lund–Potsdam–Jena General Ecosystem Simulator (LPJ-GUESS). This new model implementation, termed LPJ-GUESS-FROST, provides the ability to directly attribute simulated impacts on forest productivity dynamics to LSF. We use the example of European beech, one of the dominant deciduous species in central Europe, to demonstrate the functioning of our novel LSF module. Using a network of tree-ring observations from past frost events, we show that LPJ-GUESS-FROST can reproduce productivity reductions caused by LSF. Further, to exemplify the effects of including LSF dynamics in DVMs, we run LPJ-GUESS-FROST for a study region in southern Germany for which high-resolution climate observations are available. Here, we show that modeled LSF plays a substantial role in regulating regional net primary production (NPP) and biomass dynamics, emphasizing the need for LSF to be more widely accounted for in DVMs.},

	abstract = {Spring frosts can defoliate trees, reduce canopy carbon assimilation, and alter interspecific competition dynamics. These events may become more common with climate change, but our understanding of the associated ecological impacts is limited by the stochastic nature of their occurrences. In 2020, a late spring frost defoliated oak (
              Quercus
              spp.), but not co-occurring maples (
              Acer
              spp.) across temperate broadleaf forests of the Hudson Highlands in southern New York State, U.S.A. Defoliation impacted 60\% of this region’s forests and delayed full leaf expansion of oaks by ∼17 days. We used this event as an opportunity to advance understanding of how leaf-level physiology, radial growth, and interspecific competition dynamics of mature trees respond to frost-induced defoliation. We quantified leaf-level photosynthetic capacity, stomatal conductance, and water-use efficiency (WUE), as well as basal area increment of defoliated red oak (
              Q. rubra
              ) trees and non-defoliated red maple (
              A. rubrum
              ) trees in 2020 (“defoliation year”) and 2021 (“reference year”). Oak defoliation provided red maple trees with a competitive edge in terms of photosynthetic capacity early in the growing season. However, the second cohort of red oak leaves that developed following defoliation had photosynthetic capacities that were 3–4 times higher than red maple trees by the second half of the growing season, likely facilitated by higher rates of stomatal conductance. The growing season mean photosynthetic capacities for the defoliation year were significantly higher for red oaks than red maples. Red oak basal area increment tended to be higher than red maple during both the defoliation and reference years. For both species basal area increment was significantly higher during the reference year than defoliation year, but the reasons remain unclear. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that temporal patterns of photosynthesis in temperate broadleaf forests are altered by defoliation events, but enhanced photosynthetic capacities of second cohort leaves can reduce the negative effects of delayed leaf expansion and mitigate competitive advantages conferred to undefoliated co-occurring tree species. We suggest that understanding a tree species’ ability to compensate for frost-induced defoliation is essential to accurately predict effects of extreme climate events on tree competition dynamics and ecosystem processes.},

Here, we analyze LSFs between 1959 and 2017 and the resistance strategies of Northern Hemisphere woody species to infer trees’ adaptations for minimizing frost damage to their leaves and to forecast forest vulnerability under the ongoing changes in frost frequencies. Trait values on leaf-out and leaf-freezing resistance come from up to 1,500 temperate and boreal woody species cultivated in common gardens. We find that areas in which LSFs are common, such as eastern North America, harbor tree species with cautious (late-leafing) leaf-out strategies. Areas in which LSFs used to be unlikely, such as broad-leaved forests and shrublands in Europe and Asia, instead harbor opportunistic tree species (quickly reacting to warming air temperatures). LSFs in the latter regions are currently increasing, and given species’ innate resistance strategies, we estimate that ∼35\% of the European and ∼26\% of the Asian temperate forest area, but only ∼10\% of the North American, will experience increasing late-frost damage in the future. Our findings reveal region-specific changes in the spring-frost risk that can inform decision-making in land management, forestry, agriculture, and insurance policy.},

            Heatwaves exert disproportionately strong and sometimes irreversible impacts on forest ecosystems. These impacts remain poorly understood at the tree and species level and across large spatial scales. Here, we investigate the effects of the record-breaking 2018 European heatwave on tree growth and tree water status using a collection of high-temporal resolution dendrometer data from 21 species across 53 sites. Relative to the two preceding years, annual stem growth was not consistently reduced by the 2018 heatwave but stems experienced twice the temporary shrinkage due to depletion of water reserves. Conifer species were less capable of rehydrating overnight than broadleaves across gradients of soil and atmospheric drought, suggesting less resilience toward transient stress. In particular, Norway spruce and Scots pine experienced extensive stem dehydration. Our high-resolution dendrometer network was suitable to disentangle the effects of a severe heatwave on tree growth and desiccation at large-spatial scales in situ, and provided insights on which species may be more vulnerable to climate extremes.},

                    Recent hot droughts in California resulted in ponderosa pine (
                    Pinus ponderosa
                    ) mortality attributed to drought and western pine beetle (WPB,
                    Dendroctonus brevicomis
                    ). While drought alone can cause tree death, direct warming effects on WPB are a contributing factor. Research on WPB generation timing (voltinism), however, is lacking.
                  
                
                
                  We monitored WPB tree attacks and adult emergence timing at two California sites and developed a degree‐day model from field‐observed data. Historical, contemporary, and future temperatures for several California sites were used with the model to examine trends in WPB voltinism.
                
                
                  Field data showed a single summer and an overwinter generation at a northern California site. As summer temperatures increased beyond 1900–1980 averages, the predicted number of full and partial WPB generations by 2021 had increased from {\textasciitilde}2 annual (one summer and one overwinter) generations historically to {\textasciitilde}2.3 at two northern California sites and from {\textasciitilde}2.3 to {\textasciitilde}3.2 at two warmer California sites.
                
                
                  Historical and contemporary data suggest winter warming was not sufficient for an additional generation overwinter. Instead, increases in generations were driven by summer and fall temperatures.
                
                
                  Unconstrained increases in the number of future annual generations will be limited by complex, but not well understood, WPB thermal adaptations. Increased knowledge of temperature‐driven WPB population growth will improve forest vegetation models aimed at predicting ponderosa pine mortality in a changing climate.},

Here we show, using a process-based model (PHENOFIT), that tree species distributions can be predicted precisely if the biological processes of survival and reproductive success only are incorporated as a function of phenology. These predictions showed great predictive power when tested against present distributions of two North American species ± quaking aspen and sugar maple ± indicating that on a broad scale, the fundamental niche of trees coincides with their realized niche. Phenology is shown here to be a major determinant of plant species range and should therefore be used to assess the consequences of global warming on plant distributions, and the spread of alien plant species.},

The advantages and limits of the tools used up to now are described. A new tool, named Trephor (patent pending n° PD2004A000324), specifically designed for long-lasting use is presented. Trephor is chisel-shaped for a fast recovery of 2 mm diameter microcores. The cutting tube is inserted into the wood using a hammer and no other accessory is required. Simple technical characteristics allow high quality samples to be collected from both softwood and hardwood species with minimum damage to the sampled trees. Trephor was tested during the 2004 growing season, demonstrating good resistance to wear and tear and mechanical stress. Embedding the microcores in paraffin for fast section preparation is described.},

	abstract = {Monitoring tree phenology is important for understanding ecosystem functioning and for assessing ecosystem responses to climate change. Satellite imagery offers open-access global coverage but is restricted to forest-level analyses, due to its coarse spatial resolution. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery can monitor phenology at the individual tree level by utilizing a centimeterscale resolution. Two research objectives were identiﬁed for this study: (1) to derive phenological metrics at the individual tree level, using various vegetation indices (VIs); and (2) to assess the accuracy of automatic crown delineation in a diverse ecosystem. To achieve this, fourteen multispectral UAV ﬂights were performed, and the ability of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index 2 (EVI2), optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI), and chlorophyll index red-edge (CIre) to model seasonal phenology was assessed. A double logistic model was ﬁtted on the VI observations for each individual tree, to derive the start of season (SOS) and end of season (EOS). Individual tree crowns were delineated automatically using marker-controlled watershed segmentation (MCWS), and the treetops were identiﬁed using a local maximum ﬁlter (LMF). Overall, the automatic segmentation performed well (F-score: 0.79, IoU: 0.58), with higher accuracies in single-species areas, while it underperformed in complex mixed forest structures. All VIs captured a strong seasonal signal for the deciduous trees and derived SOS and EOS estimates consistent with literature and ground observations. General phenological patterns included an early silver birch SOS, a quick beech budburst, and large within-species phenology variations for oak trees. Seasonal VI variation for coniferous evergreen trees was limited, and the resulting phenology estimates proved unreliable. In conclusion, these ﬁndings emphasize the capabilities of UAV imagery for individual tree crown phenology monitoring. However, they also show the difﬁculty of monitoring evergreen phenology with the commonly-used VIs and stress the need for further investigations.},

          , 
            Earlier vegetation greening under climate change raises evapotranspiration and thus lowers spring soil moisture, yet the extent and magnitude of this water deficit persistence into the following summer remain elusive. We provide observational evidence that increased foliage cover over the Northern Hemisphere, during 1982–2011, triggers an additional soil moisture deficit that is further carried over into summer. Climate model simulations independently support this and attribute the driving process to be larger increases in evapotranspiration than in precipitation. This extra soil drying is projected to amplify the frequency and intensity of summer heatwaves. Most feedbacks operate locally, except for a notable teleconnection where extra moisture transpired over Europe is transported to central Siberia. Model results illustrate that this teleconnection offsets Siberian soil moisture losses from local spring greening. Our results highlight that climate change adaptation planning must account for the extra summer water and heatwave stress inherited from warming-induced earlier greening.},

	abstract = {Tree growth is an important indicator of forest health, productivity, and demography. Knowing precisely how trees’ grow within a year, instead of across years, can lead to a ﬁner understanding of the mechanisms that drive these larger patterns. The growing use of dendrometer bands in research forests has only rarely been used to measure growth at resolutions ﬁner than yearly, but intra-annual growth patterns can be observed from dendrometer bands using precision digital calipers and weekly measurements. Here we present a workﬂow to help forest ecologists ﬁt growth models to intra-annual measurements using standard optimization functions provided by the R platform. We explain our protocol, test uncertainty in parameter estimates with respect to sample sizes, extend the optimization protocol to estimate robust lower and upper annual diameter bounds, and discuss potential challenges to optimal ﬁts. We offer R code to implement this workﬂow. We found that starting values and initial optimization routines are critical to ﬁtting the best functional forms. After using a bounded, broad search method, a more focused search algorithm obtained consistent results. To estimate starting and ending annual diameters, we combined the growth function with early and late estimates of beginning and ending growth. Once we ﬁt the functions, we present extension algorithms that estimate periodic reductions in growth, total growth, and present a method of controlling for the shifting allocation to girth during the growth season. We demonstrate that with these extensions, an analysis of growth response to weather (e.g., the water available to a tree) can be derived in a way that is comparable across trees, years, and sites. Thus, this approach, when applied across broader data sets, offers a pathway to build inference about the effects of seasonal weather on growth, size- and light-dependent patterns of growth, species-speciﬁc patterns, and phenology.},

              Projected changes in temperature and drought regime are likely to reduce carbon (C) storage in forests, thereby amplifying rates of climate change. While such reductions are often presumed to be greatest in semi‐arid forests that experience widespread tree mortality, the consequences of drought may also be important in temperate mesic forests of Eastern North America (
              ENA
              ) if tree growth is significantly curtailed by drought. Investigations of the environmental conditions that determine drought sensitivity are critically needed to accurately predict ecosystem feedbacks to climate change. We matched site factors with the growth responses to drought of 10,753 trees across mesic forests of
              ENA
              , representing 24 species and 346 stands, to determine the broad‐scale drivers of drought sensitivity for the dominant trees in
              ENA
              . Here we show that two factors—the timing of drought, and the atmospheric demand for water (i.e., local potential evapotranspiration;
              PET
              )—are stronger drivers of drought sensitivity than soil and stand characteristics. Drought‐induced reductions in tree growth were greatest when the droughts occurred during early‐season peaks in radial growth, especially for trees growing in the warmest, driest regions (i.e., highest
              PET
              ). Further, mean species trait values (rooting depth and ψ
              50
              ) were poor predictors of drought sensitivity, as intraspecific variation in sensitivity was equal to or greater than interspecific variation in 17 of 24 species. From a general circulation model ensemble, we find that future increases in early‐season
              PET
              may exacerbate these effects, and potentially offset gains in C uptake and storage in
              ENA

              Energy and water limitations of tree growth remain insufficiently understood at large spatiotemporal scales, hindering model representation of interannual or longer-term ecosystem processes. By assessing and statistically scaling the climatic drivers from 2710 tree-ring sites, we identified the boreal and temperate land areas where tree growth during 1930–1960 CE responded positively to temperature (20.8 ± 3.7 Mio km
              2

              ; 96.4 ± 4.1\%), and other parameters. The spatial manifestation of this climate response is determined by latitudinal and altitudinal temperature gradients, indicating that warming leads to geographic shifts in growth limitations. We observed a significant (
              P
              {\textless} 0.001) decrease in temperature response at cold-dry sites between 1930–1960 and 1960–1990 CE, and the total temperature-limited area shrunk by −8.7 ± 0.6 Mio km

	abstract = {The monitoring of forest phenology in a cost-eﬀective manner, at a ﬁne spatial scale and over relatively large areas remains a signiﬁcant challenge. To address this issue, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) appear to be a potential new platform for forest phenology monitoring. This article assesses the potential of UAV data to track the temporal dynamics of spring phenology, from the individual tree to woodland scale, and cross-compare UAV results against ground and satellite observations, in order to better understand characteristics of UAV data and assess potential for use in validation of satellite-derived phenology. A time series of UAV data (5 cm spatial resolution, {\textasciitilde}7 day temporal resolution) were acquired in tandem with an intensive ground campaign during the spring season of 2015 across a 15 ha mixed woodland. Phenophase transition dates were estimated at an individual tree-level using UAV time series of Normalized Diﬀerence Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Green Chromatic Coordinate (GCC) and validated against visual observations of tree phenology. UAV-derived start of season dates could be predicted with an accuracy of {\textless} 1 week. The analysis was scaled to a plot level, where ground (visual assessment and understorey development), UAV and Landsat metrics were compared, indicating UAV data is eﬀective for tracking canopy phenology, as opposed to ecosystem dynamics detected by satellites. The UAV data were used to automatically map phenological events for individual trees across the whole woodland, demonstrating that contrasting canopy phenological events can occur within the extent of a single Landsat pixel. This, and a large temporal gap in the Landsat series, accounted for the poor relationships found between UAV- and Landsat-derived phenometrics (R2 {\textless} 0.50) in this study. An opportunity is now available to track very ﬁne scale land surface changes over contiguous vegetation communities, providing information which could improve characterization of vegetation phenology at multiple scales.},

Phenological processes have been studied from landscape to global scales using Earth observing satellite data, and at local scale by in situ surveys of individual plants. Now, data acquired from multi-spectral sensors on drone platforms provide ﬂexible opportunities for monitoring phenology from individual plants to small ecosystem scales efﬁciently, allowing community and species level information to be derived. We captured a time-series of drone-acquired normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data with a multi-spectral sensor (Parrot Sequoia, (Parrot, France)) over a highly heterogeneous ecosystem in Cornwall, UK, during a period of spring green-up. We monitored NDVI trajectories at the individual crown and species’ level. For deciduous crowns, we derived metrics representative of spring phenological stages: Start-of-spring (SOS), middle-ofspring green-up (MOG) and start-of-peak greenness (SOP) using a logistic function. While the exact timing of SOS, MOG and SOP appeared susceptible to understorey effects and saturation of the NDVI, relative timing of green-up for a subset of species was plausible in relation to phenological observations from an extended geographic region and in situ plant area index (PAI) measurements. In evergreen vegetation (Pinus spp.) subtle changes were also detected through the growing season. The impact of illumination differences was analysed for image pairs during leaf-off and leaf-on conditions. While signiﬁcant, these effects were small (mean absolute NDVI deviation of up to 0.034 for leaf-off, 0.013 for leaf-on conditions), meaning that data captured under both constant direct and diffuse irradiance conditions can be used together and that cloudy conditions should not lead to data gaps. We conclude that the capability of drone-mounted multi-spectral instruments for spatio-temporal characterization of crown-level phenology shows great promise for improving the understanding of intra- and inter-species differences in strategy, and offers an efﬁcient means of doing so over areas of a few hectares.},
