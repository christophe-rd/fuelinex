## Notes of committee meeting  
### 11 March 2025 
#### Compiling notes taken during the committee meeting practice.
1. Slide on hypothesis in Lizzie's paper. Remove it from main presentation, but keep it for a question like Zihui's. Well, this is hard to tease appart, actually I am aware it's complicated and it can go through different pathways.
2. Change font. ok
3. Betulacea change. ok
4. Slide number. ok
5. Dendrochronological methods and nutrients: get ready to answer them. ok
6. Change Design to full factorial of cool/warm spring/fall. 
7. Really say that this is a full factorial design.
8. Remove cool spring and whatever in the experimetnal design because we can't see it.
9. Present pictures better in the second half of the presentation. 
10. Cookies: show guesses on the year and show a good cookie and a hard one. I feel good about and another one I am struggling with. 
11. Biomass measurements: we are destructively destroy the tree. ok
12. Missing clear transition between the two experiments
13. Cut Piao with one panel. With arrows. Spring advances. Autumn delays = growing season longer. 
14. Chapter 1 is my chapter to address this experimentaly. ok
15. Transition: experimental to observational. ok
16. Start of the season and how they relate to growing season length.?
17. Slide number. ok.
18. Remove dots in experimental design. ok
19. Common garden study not a experimental. ok
20. Skip treespotters not official. ok
21. Italicize journal names in the references. ok.
22. At the end, repeat what I want from my committee: e.g. that's my plan and am looking forward to hearing feedback. ok

##### Questions posed:
1. Chapter 2: Tree growth is determined by phylogeny and climate condition. In the statistics, how will I separate different effects like phylogeny and climate change effects. How will I distinguish between more days and increased temperature? **Suggestion:** Structure modelling approach trying to model pathways and with different models trying to quantify the relative contribution of each factor.
2. Why did I decide to add nutrients to CC/WW? **Lizzie's answer:** get a bigger effect size where cool cool is shorter and warm warm is longer. 
3. How to measure biomass: allometric equations to derive biomass from the previous GS. Different metrics to measure biomass.
4. Lizzie:Supplemental experiment to see if nutrients have limiting effects later in the season. 
	Me: How is the nutrient addition treatment related to chapter 1. Answer: if some species can absorb nutrients later in the season compared to others that can't, they might show growth increment in the following season. Some species might not be able to absorb more carbon later in the season, but they could absorb more nutrients thus showing an advantage..
5. What do I expect from this experiment? Get a prediction slide.
