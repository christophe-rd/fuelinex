Assuming that all the information prior to planting is already noted down (e.g. what temperature the cuttings were stored at etc.)

30 cm long shoot tip cuttings of both red alder and balsam poplar were soaked at the cut wound for 15 minutes in a solution of 20 mL indole-butyric acid 0.4% (Wilson Liquid root stimulator) diluted in 2 litres of warm tap water. (0.004% concentration)

180 1-gallon pots were filled up to 1 inch from the lip with pre-moistened peat-based potting mix containing large pumice chunks. Soil was pressed firmly to compact. Cuttings were placed into the soil at the depth such that pre-drawn red paint lines could still be visible just above the soil surface.
