## 2026 Fleeting notes
In well watered temperate and boreal forests, warmer springs have advanced the onset and lengthened the duration of wood formation--> higher xylem production
However, in water limited forest ecosytems, the growth rate has a higher influence on the final number of xylem cells formed by the end of the GS than the start or the duration of growth. 
The growth rate is sensitive to variations in water availability unlike the onset and duration of growth (link to paper on xyelm production water sensitivity compared to vegetation). This is why GS extension may not increase wood production ina rid and semi-arid forests, especially when warming increases water stress. 

As Dow showed, warmer springs may not increase growth, but can even reduce it in drought-prone forests probably due to prolonged droughts.

They show an interesting case where climate shifted from warm and dry to warm and wet, despite this, tree rings show a negative relationship with stem radial increment.

Their results show a decoupling between growth duration and total cell production in their study sites because warming induced longer duration of xylem production did not increase wood cell production.

They don't show differences in cell enlargment cessation across sites which suggests that factors other than temperature and precipitation, such as soil moisture availability, photoperiod or nutrient availability may play a bigger role in the cessation of cell production. 

Warmer spring temperatures trigger the onset of cell production, but it doesn't alone increase wood production. Precipitation has a more decise role in wood production regulation, which their results support.

In their dry sites, the number of enlargement cells show a bimodal pattern across the GS, except for the wettest sites which illustrates the plasticity of cell production rate in response to fluctuations in water availability in the arid and semiarid region.

They conclude that long GS may even decrease xylem growth under water-constrainted environments.

Trees near elevation or altitude tree line are often used for reconstructing climate because of their close relationship with temperature.

They used 2 models driven by simulated temperature variations to demonstrate that the discrepency between expected and reconstructed temperatures is an artefact cause by a reduced sensitivity of cooling of trees near treeline:
1. GCM: forced simulation of the US National Center for Atm Reseach (NCAR) CSM1.4 coupled ocean-general circulation model (GCM)
2. EBM: simulations of a simpler energy-balance climate model

Both models are driven by estimated radiative forcings, they both capture historical temperature
records, including cooling from volcanos.

Both models predict a drop of 2C following the 1258/1259 eruption whereas the reconstruction shows a decrease of +- 0.6c

They checked if the tree ring reconstruction proxy could have caused the discrepency. But it doesn't seem to be the case.

**Climate sensitivity**: how much warming we get as a result of radiative forcing.

Carbon uptake, storage, and allocation patterns  contribute to blurring of annual 14C signals in  tree rings
2026
Amy E. C , Andrew D. Richardson, Mariah S. Carbone

Until the last few decades, most measurements of C14 in tree rings were collected for calibrating the radiocarbon scale OR dating wood material and were sampled over multiple rings to reflect C14 over several years to decade. This is because all photosynthetic organisms record tropospheric C14 aproximately equally.

Differences in phenological timing may be related to wood anatomy where large-diameter vessels of ring porous species are prone to cavitation during winter freeze-thaw cycles and hence leaf out must occur after the onset of wood growth.

Because of the difference in phenology across ecosystems, there is great variation as to when and to what degree forests at different locations on the Earth's surface are sampling C14 signature of the troposphere. This variation is essential to understanding how C14 associated with Miyake events is incorportared into tree rings.  

The timing and duration of xylogenesis is driven by endogenous and exogenous factors. Exogenous include environemntal conditions sucha s water availabiltiy and photoperiod while endogenous factors include tree age, tree size and canopy position.

NSCs serve other essential roles in trees such as osmoregulation, defense, heartwood formation, transport and export to symbiotic relationships. NSCs are stored in tissues in the form of sugar and starch. Sugards are mobiles, starch aren't. Starch must first be hydrolyzed to soluble sugar before being transported and used by the tree. NSC is an energy source when the demand for photosynthesis exceeds supply such as night, dormant season, in response to stress or distrubtance or across different organs (leaves vs roots.


NSC are stored in two types of wood parenchyma cells: radial and axial. The amoutna and size of these cells vary greatly with wood anatomy and determines the capacity of trees to store NSCs.

Usually decidous trees have more NSC storage becasue of differing leaf growth needs in spring.

Mature trees store NSCs that can be hours to years to decade old!

There is direct and indirect evidence of NSC from previous years to be carried over from one year and allocated to wood growth in subsequent years. 

The studies metnionned support the idea that some mixing of new assimilates into a pool of somewhat older and mobile NSC ocurs before allocation to new growth, leading to carryover effects which may blur isotopic signals from varying climatic conditions across multiple years.

### The ecology and economics of storage in plants
F. Stuart Chapin
Harold Mooney
Ernst-Detlef Schulze
1990
They define storage as resources that build up in the plant and can be mobilized in the future to support biosynthesis for growth or other functions. They suggest 3 classes of storage:
1. Accumulation which is the increase of compounds that do no directly promote growth. Occurs when supply exceeds demands for growth and maintenace
2. Reserve formation involves the metabolically regulated compartmentation or synthesis of storage compounds from resources that might directly promote growth. Reserve formation competes with growth and defense
3. Recycling: reutilization fo compounds whose immediate physiological function contributes to growth or defense but which subsequently be broken down to support future growth. Absence of recycling = litter.

Seasonal dynamics and age of stemwood nonstructural  carbohydrates in temperate forest trees
Andrew D. Richardson, Mariah S. Carbone, Trevor F. Keenan, Claudia I. Czimczik, David Y. Hollinger, Paula Murakami, Paul G. Schaberg and Xiaomei Xu
2013

Trees accumulate and store NSC as resources to be used to support future growth and metabolism. This NSC pool is essentially:
1. Sugars (mostly surcrose)
2. Starch
It's thought that a large fraction of a tree's annual C budget is allocated to the NSC pool

The standard conceptual model for NSCs is the pool is:
1. Depleted when demand exceeds supply, e.g. when metabolism and growth requirements are high or when production of photoassimilates (the carbon fixed and incorporated into plant tissues wheras photosynthate is the product of photosynthesis) is limited by the environment
2. Recharged when the supply exceeds demand, e.g. when environmental conditions permit high rates of photosynthesis, or when growth and metabolism are low. 
Korner 2003 framework argues that the size of the NSC pool is mostly driven by demand-side fractors. In this framework, storing NSCs for future use is viewed as bet-heding strategy, providing reserves that the tree can use when stressed. Moreover, carbon isotope labeling studies showed that NSC are usd to fuel growth and respiration when the supply of photoassimilates is inadequate. There is even evidence that stored NSCs, especially bellow-ground can remain a decade after assimilation. 

They mention an hypothesis drawn by 6 articles, where time lags between C uptake and biomass growth could be explained by NSC pool that functions as temporary storage with accumulated NSC not being drawn upon for allocation to growth until the following year.

Starch is the long-term storage form of NSC and is immobile

They report an hypothesis of "last in, first out" where the most recently added starch molecules are the first to be converted back to sugars to support metabolic demands. They interpret their results as stressed trees (because of climate, age, disease, damage) have higher demande for stored NSC because they do not have new photosynthates.
