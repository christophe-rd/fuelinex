## 2026 Fleeting notes
In well watered temperate and boreal forests, warmer springs have advanced the onset and lengthened the duration of wood formation--> higher xylem production
However, in water limited forest ecosytems, the growth rate has a higher influence on the final number of xylem cells formed by the end of the GS than the start or the duration of growth. 
The growth rate is sensitive to variations in water availability unlike the onset and duration of growth (link to paper on xyelm production water sensitivity compared to vegetation). This is why GS extension may not increase wood production ina rid and semi-arid forests, especially when warming increases water stress. 

As Dow showed, warmer springs may not increase growth, but can even reduce it in drought-prone forests probably due to prolonged droughts.

They show an interesting case where climate shifted from warm and dry to warm and wet, despite this, tree rings show a negative relationship with stem radial increment.

Their results show a decoupling between growth duration and total cell production in their study sites because warming induced longer duration of xylem production did not increase wood cell production.

They don't show differences in cell enlargment cessation across sites which suggests that factors other than temperature and precipitation, such as soil moisture availability, photoperiod or nutrient availability may play a bigger role in the cessation of cell production. 

Warmer spring temperatures trigger the onset of cell production, but it doesn't alone increase wood production. Precipitation has a more decise role in wood production regulation, which their results support.

In their dry sites, the number of enlargement cells show a bimodal pattern across the GS, except for the wettest sites which illustrates the plasticity of cell production rate in response to fluctuations in water availability in the arid and semiarid region.

They conclude that long GS may even decrease xylem growth under water-constrainted environments.
