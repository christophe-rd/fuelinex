### Convergence of leaf‐out towards minimum risk of freezing damage in temperate trees
##### Permanent notes: YES
Armando Lenz, Christian Korner, Yann Vitasse, Sabrina Russo. 2016
Leaf-out occurs when the probability to encounter freezing damage approaches zero irrespective of climatic conditions (low vs high elevation) and species (early- and late-flushing species.

In other words, trees leaf out precisely at the beginning of the probabilistically safe period.

Species with a small safety margin against freezing (*define safety margin*) like F. Sylvatica, employ photoperiod co-control of spring phenology. Species with a large safety margin depend more on temperature.\

Species that employ photoperiod co-control of leaf-out (E.g. F. Sylvatica) can leaf-out closer to the period with a high probability of freeing damage than species relying more strongly on temperature controle.

### Effects of Genetic Perturbation on Seasonal Life History Plasticity
##### Permanent notes: YES

They showed that A. thaliana ecotypes can't be divided into 2 discrete classes of winter-annual and rapid-cyling genotypes. Rather, most ecotypes may be capable of both life histories but vary in the sensitivity and timing of the rapid transition between them. Natural variation in flowering pathways may have the greatest phenotypic expression and exposure to antural selection in climates that permit late-summer germination.

### European deciduous trees exhibit similar safety margins against damage by spring freeze events along elevational gradients
##### Permanent notes: YES
Yann Vitasse, Christian Korner, 2013

A major part of freeing resistance is to maintain membrane fluidity during the freezing process and to tolerate freezing-induced dehydration in the cell plasma.

To do this, plants synthesize dehydrings and antifreeze proteins and reduce the amount of membrane-located carriers and receptors during the pre-hardening stage in late autumn. Next, plants change the ultrastucture of the cytoplasm and increase the proline and polyol concentrations during the early stage of hardening. The final stage of hardening is reached by a repeated exposure to freezing temperatures during dormancy in winter, leading to species-specific freezing rsistance.

In spring, when the leaves emerge, they loose irreversibly their freezing resistance.

By the end of summer, after budset, the freezing resistance begins to increase again in response to shortening photoperiod and decreasing temperature.

Species range limits are driven by a trade-off between growing season length and escape from damaging freezing events.

They show that freezing events across elevations are such a strong selective pressure  that trees delay flushing until they are safe from damage caused by freezing temperatures.

Delays of leaf unfolding are reported and it is such taht the period available to recover from spring frost damage becomes much shorter at high elevations. Thus it would explain why common garden using elevation gradients showed different spring phenology irrespective of actual weather.

Thus, a short GS limits fruit ripening and seed maturation, potentially shaping northern distribution limits.\

In addition to seed maturation, latitudinal tree species distribution has been sugested to be limited by min. metabolic requirements to fulfil life history traits.

Tree species differ in their min. requirement of GSL that enables them to complete their annual life cycle successfully with respect to species-specific life history traits, e.g. seed related traits, wood anatomy,bud formation or leaf traits. Thus, species-specific min. GSL may bee the ultimate range-limiting factor.

### Genomic evidence for West Antarctic Ice Sheet collapse during the Last Interglacial
#### Permanent notes: YES
CC is causing rapid changes in Antarctica including Antarctic Ice Sheet mass loss, with global impacts:

1. Uncertainty in sea level rise projections
2. Marine-based West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) lost 160 gigatons of ice mass/year between 1979 and 2017
3.  It will continue to be a major contributor to Global Mean Sea Level (GMSL) rise under all 	CO2 emission scenarios
4. Unclear whether WAIS is vulnerable to rapid ice loss or full collapse as a result of poor understanding of futur changes.
 
WAIS collapse could raise the global sea level to 3.3 to 5 meters

In the Pleistocene, summer temperatures were much hotter and sea level were higher. There is no evidence whether WAIS completely collapsed at any time in the three million years since the Pliocene
WAIS collapsed when global mean surface temperature  (GMST) was 0.5 to 1.5 C than the preindustrial. This suggests that the tipping point of future WAIS collapse is close. This will bring an significant increase in GMSL

###Potential for evolutionary responses to climate change – evidence from tree populations

FLORIAN J. ALBERTO, 2013
#### Permanent notes: YES
Populations can respond to environmental change through phenotypic plasticity, by moving to a new area corresponding to environmental conditions they are adapted to, by genetically adapting to the new conditions, or by a combinations of these responses.
Local adapation is more common in trees than in some other plant species. Trees are adapted to the current climate and they are thus potentially greatly influenced by the rapid changes in climate.

The long generation times are a challenge in tree research but they also provide adavantages:
1. Adaption to CC depends on phenotypic traits relevant to new environments such as timinign of growth and drought or cold tolerance and we have a low of into on quantittative genetics and population idfferenetiation of trees because of the 250 years of forestry provenance trials.
2. The demographic history since the last glaciual maximum has been reconstructed for a lot of species by combining phylogeographic and palynological approaches (*define this in a new note) with coalescent-based studies of population demogrpahy. Rates of past adaptation to CC can be infered from these studies. 

CC may result in the intro of new pests, e.g. mountain pine beetle or new pathogens, but also losses of current competittos, insects or diseases caused e.g. by phenological shifts between trees and associated pests. 

Pheno shifts with increased temperature : (Menzel & Fabian, 1999; Menzel et al., 2006; Parmesan, 2006)

Cool table describing linear regressions of 1. bud flush and 2. budset along altitudinal and latitudinal gradients. It shows that the 2 pheno traits differ in their patterns. For bud flush, both altitudinal and latitudinal clines showed similar shallow slopes, but the direction of adaptation varied greatly among species. E.g. pop from high altitude Q. petrae flushed late whereas F. Sylvatica flushed early. Reflects tradeoff between max growing season and spring frost. 
Bud set showed steeper slopes for both gradients and in all species more northern or higher altitude populations had earlier bud set. This indicates that differentail selection on bud set is systematically stronger than on bud flush. Bud flush may display higher phenotypic plasticity as temperatures increase. 

Spring a warming climate, spring phenology can likely respond and advance without much genetic change as has already been seen in many species, provided than chilling requirements are met. 

Criticism: commercially less important species are poorly represented in previously established common gardens regarless of having wide or small ranges. Small range species are more vulnerable. 

### Dominant radial and height growth reveal comparable historical variations for common beech in north-eastern France
Jean-Daniel Bontemps, 2010
**Permanent notes:** YES
The accuracy of radial growth is questioned for investigating past forest productivity changes. 
1. Radial growth of individual trees is sensitive to local competition dynamics driven by natural disturbances or sylviculture in managed ecosystems. These processes are independant of site fertility conditions, radial growth of trees isn't considered a good indicator of stand productivty potential in forestry compared to mean height. Sampling of trees is usually restricted to dominant trees which experience lower competition intensity and belong to a fairly stable population over time. 
2. Radial growth is usually sampled at breast height. During severe climatic events, ring width reduction may be acute at breast height compared to other positions. Such events modify the relationship between ring size and tree volume increment. 

### Observed forest sensitivity to climate implies large changes in 21st century North American forest growth
Noah D. Charney,, 2016
**Permanent notes:** YES
The degree to which increased atmospheric CO2 will increase future plant growth (i.e. carbon fertilisation) remains an important unresolved effect. Different pathways can be taken to influence growth and tehse effectsa re integfrated within metrics of water-use efficiency (WUE). Increased WUE has been invoked to explain opbservations such as accelerated growth in free-air carbon enrichment experiments,but its role in reducing water-stress is not clear.
### Xylogenesis: Coniferous Trees of Temperate Forests Are ListeningtotheClimateTaleduringtheGrowingSeason But Only Remember the Last Words!
Henri E. Cuny
**Permanent notes:** YES
Wood formation (xylogenesis) can generate various wood forms in response to developmental or environmental constraints. Wood anatomy can be observed between different phylogenetic groups.
Wood anatomy is known toa dapt to changes in environmental conditions in space or time. Some of the most spectacular variations in wood anatomy occur in a single tree ring. E.g. in confiers, the diameter and wall thickness of the most abundant cells (tracheids) are divided and multipilied by 5 when going from the beginning to the end of a tree ring. Usually well ordered along treee rings and more or less progressive. 
	
Plant development reslts in changes in signal concentration or in tissue sensitivity through the GS creating the typical tree-ring structure. May be tied to daylength
	
In contrast, the environmental theory proposes that the within-ring anatomical changes are driven mainly by climatic constraints. 
	
Cell enlargement is the plant process the most sensitive to water stress. Long lasting belief that decreasing water availability triggers the transition from wide earlywood cells to the narrow latewood cells (Good refs but don't tell if the belief is still accurate). In contrast, wall thickening involves numerous and complex metabolic processes which are considerted the most sensitive to temperature amopn all the physiological processes related to tree carbon balance.

### Growth variations of Common beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) under different climatic and environmental conditions in EuropeÐa dendroecological study
Christoph Dittmar
**Permanent notes:** YES
Dendrochronological studies on beech. Good description of their methods.
Chronologies are of good quality if they have the following features:
1. High average cross-correlation for ring series derived from trees within the site
2. High mean sensitivity (relative to year to year variability
3. High percentage of common variance of the components represented in the standardiozed stand chronology 
4. 4. Low first-order serial correlation

They recommend dendrochronological investigations with temporal and spatial comparisons to prove environmenetal impacts on forest growth and vitality. 

### Severe drought can delay autumn senescence of silver birch in the current year but advance it in the next year
Inge Dox, Matteo Campioli
**Permanent notes:** YES
For the Silver birch used in the study (in norway), cambial activation occurred by the end of April and bud burst occured about 2 weeks before cambial reactivation. But another year, it was the opposite. 

Cambium reactivation took place or before budburst depending on the year. This can be because of birch's diffuse-porous character. Likely, not all conduits are fully embolized in birch in winter and it si therefore not necessary for birch to produce new condutis before leaf expansion in spring. (Are all birches diffuse-porous). Another study in Belgium on birches also found that cambium reactivation took place 19 days before budburst.

Cambial reactivation can take place before bud-burst as trees can use carbohydrate reserves from previous year to fuel the new wood growth. 

They showed that severe summer drought induce an advancement of the cessation of wood growth. 

The onset of loss canopy greenesss was delayed by summer drought. It's in contrast with the litterature where one possibility is that leaf mortality occured earlier than the start of their obervations. Can be because trees drought stressed would have triggered a delayed senescence to enhance carbon assimilation. 

They didn't see a lag effect of drought on the cessation of wood growth of the next year.

Difference in tree-ring width can be the result of 4 things:
1. early cambium reactivation in 2018
2. Deficit in carbohydrates of reserves in 2018 negatively affecting wood growth the following year. 
3. Fast-wood production during the spring 
4. Presence of tension wood overestimating the tree-ring width in that year.

### Species specific growth responses of black spruce and trembling aspen may enhance resilience of boreal forest to climate change
Igor Drobyshev and Yves Bergeron, 2013
**Permanent notes** YES
Dendroclimatic studies suggest that aspen growth is mostly influenced by climatic conditions of the year prior to growth. 

Differences in climate-growth relationships between spruce and aspen during non-anomalous weather ( periods dominated by weather conditions only moderately deviating from respective long-term means), suggests that growth responses may also differ between species during climatically extreme growing seasons.
Methods:
To obtain growth chronologies with amplified high-frequency variability, the series were detrended in the ARSTAN program, using a 32-year cubic smoothing spline with a 50% frequency response (Speer 2010)
For aspens, extremely cold summers limited trees' physiological activity and resulted in consistently negative growth anomalies. This is caused by link between growth rate and tree viability. Years with severe environemntal activity manifest itself in the tree ring record as pointer years and have been shown to cause long-term declines in tree growth and delayed mortality. 
Future climate will exhibit higher frequency of climatic extremes and the mixed stands may show a higher resilience under the future climates than monodominate communities. They conclude this from the evidence of the spatial and temporal niche separation between aspen and black spruce. 
###Influence of annual weather on growth of pedunculate oak in southern Sweden
Igor Drobyshev, 2008
**Permanent notes:** YES
The growth of Pedunculate oak in Europe is negatively affected by summer drought and spring frost. A study of pan-European oak pointer years was able to link them with period of temperature and precipitation anomales controlled by the North-Atlantic and Arctic circulation patterns. 
Positiver growth anomalies were assocaited with extended periods of increased soil-water avalilability. Negative anomalies were realted to periods of lower air temperatures and reduced soil moisture. However, these studies focused on the effect of climatic extremes with no comparison with climatic controles over growth during climatic extremes and non-extremes years. 

In germany, Pedunculate oak and European beech have show that much lesser growth response of oak trees to drought as compared with European beech, which might reflect the differences in root systems of these two species. 

### Evolutionary and plastic responses to climate change in terrestrial plant populations
Steven J. Franks, Sally Aitken, 2013
**Permanent notes:** YES
As climate changes, plant populations may no longer be optimally adapted to new conditions. Migration could a llow some populations to track suitable conditions and thus maintain their adaptive optimum. However, this might be hard in fragmented landscapes and for species with long generation lengths.

Migration may allow a pop to stay in its climatic envelope but cause it to be out of synch with other environmental factors such as photoperiod or key mutualists such as pollinators. 

Two meta-analysis of receiprocal transplant studies, one with 35 studies of plants have found that local adaptation is common but not universal with 71% of studies showing some evidence of local adaptation.

Many tree species hav e shown strong evidence of local adaptataion to climate in provenacne experiments., which are common egarden experiments testing the provenance on tree survival, growth rates and other phenotypic traists. In a mewta an analysis of provenacne experiments for 59 tree species and 19 phenotypic traits, 90% of analyses found significant population differentiation for phenotypic traits and in most cases, this differentation was correlated with and attributed to variaton in climate.  Alberto and al. 2013.

Dendrochrnology studies can be used to asssess variation in tree rings in common garden experiments although ontogenetic effects of aging need to be separated from effects of temporal fluctuation in climate. 

Tree ring data from The Illingworth lodgepole pine provenance trial shows that average tree ring widths shows strong interactions between mean temperature of population origins and mean temperature of test sites, reflecting local adaptation and strong effects of site temperature and moisture --> phenotypic plasticity. Annual variation in ring width (climatic sensitivity showed weaker effects of site climate and provenance climate than average ring width.

The studies they examined all showed of phenological phenotypic plasticity. 

Vitasse et al 2010 showed that an elevational reciprocal transplant study of two European deciduous tree species, both timing of leaf emergence and senescence showed greater variation due to phenotypic plastricity than genetic differences. The most delayed senescence (non-linear) was in intermediate thermal environments. Likely the result of moisture dewficits resulting in premature senescence at high temperatures and resulted in a nonlinear reaction norm between temp and GS length for all populations. 

###Sensitivity of leaf unfolding to experimental warming in three temperate tree species
Ivan A. Janssens, 2013
**Permanent notes:** yes
Observed phenological trends in the last decades cannot be directly be used to extrapolate future pheno changes because the mechanisms guiding them aren't clear and because pheno responses of trees to warming may not be linear. Indeed, accurate predictions require an in-depth accurate mecchanistic understanding of leaf unfolding process and its sensitivity to environmental drivers, especially temperature and photoperiod. 

Stages of leaf unfolding process:
1. bud dormancy needs to be broken by exposure to cold temperatures during winter (chilling). A certain number of chilling units (i.e. function of daily temp (chilling days model) or  of hourly temperature (chilling hours model) below a cold treshold needs to be accumulated. 
2. Once sufficient chilling has been accumulated, the second phase of dormancy is achieved. Sufficient warmth is needed to trigger bud burst, refered to as forcing. Requirements of forcing is either linked to a linear tempearture relation above a given temperature treshold or a sigmoid temperature function. Thus, the interaction of chilling and forcing requirements with temperature determines the tioming of leaf unfolding. 

Warming trend increased forcing temperature accumulation, while in most boreal and temperate regions, winters are still sufficiently cold to ensure adequate chilling.

###Global variation in thermal tolerances and vulnerability of endotherms to climate change
**Permanent notes :** YES
Birds seem to lab behind in tracking their climatic envelopes via shifts of their geographiocal ranges. It might suggests that birds may either be able to adapt rapidly to novel environemental conditions or the level of CC does not exceed their tolerance limits. 

Their results support that birds thermal physiology is more directly linked to their ambien climatic conditions than mammal. The later can build burrows and dens to create their preferred microclimates unlike most species of birds.

### Comparison of the timing of spring phenological events between phenological garden trees and wild populations
Calum J. Sweeney, Astrid Wingler, 2023
**Permanent notes :** YES
Advancing spring phenology can extend the GS, and increase carbon uptake. But it recent research suggeests that it may not be sequestrated in wood, casting doubt on the long-term carbon sink arrising from phenological change.

Their results suggest taht genetic factors are the most likely cause for the different phenological timing between the clones and wild populations.

There is a relationship between size and phenological timing where young trees leaf out earlier to take advantage of vernal light in woodland understories in spring. They highlight the importance of taking tree size and age intop account when interpretating pheno garden data.

### Day length unlikely to constrain climate-driven shifts in leaf-out times of northern woody plants
Constantin Zohner, Susanne Renner, 2016
**Permanent notes :** 
photoperiod limitation: idea that plant sensitivity to day length protects leaves against frost damage by guiding budburst into a safe time period. Experiments show that day length sensitive species react to spring temperatures only once day length increases. --? d-l senstive species may not react to warmer temperatures. 

They showed a negative correlation between species' reliance on day length as a leaf-out signal and the winter duration in their native ranges. Two possible mechanisms on how photoperiod perception in plants may interact with warmin requirements:
- Either plants need to reach a fixed photoperiod treshold before they perceive spring temperatures
	Trees from longer winter region would have longer photoperiod tresholds because days are already long when min temp cross freezing treshold.
- Forcing requirements gradually decrease with increasing photoperiod.
	Photoperiod as a budburst regulator is less important in regions with long winters because days in spring are long before the risk the risk of frost has past. 
	
### Determination of intraspecific variation in seed weight, leaf functional traits, and sapling size of Betula ermanii using a common garden experiment
Aye Myat Myat Paing, 2021
**Permanent notes :** 
Common garden experiments and provenance trials can help determine the genetic control of phenotypic traits. 

### Differential responses to changes in growth temperature between trees from different functional groups and biomes: a review and synthesis of data
DANIELLE A. WAY, 2010
**Permanent notes :** 
Dendrochronology studies have found a positive relationship between growth and warmer growing seaons, hwoerver, increasing temperatures since the 1950s have a lower than expected effect in a lot of Northern hemispehere species. This switch in growth response to temp in tree ring studies is known as the divergence problem. 

Causes of divergence problem:
- Drought stress in summer. E.g. Sierra Nevada increased mortality of fir and pine trees between 1980 and 2004 correlated with increasing temperatures
- Shorter GS caused by increased snowfall and thus later snowmelt.
- Summer temperatures are exceeding the thermal optimum for growth. 

Trees from colder environments may benefit from some degree of climate warming, but not the species from warmer climates.

Why is growth enhanced at higher temperature? Biochemical processes such as photosynthesis and respiration are enhanced at higher temperatures because of quicker enzyme function. Acclimatation may also increase performance. 

Leaf traits were linked to changes in daytime temperature.

High temperatures increase shoot elongation rates in crops and in trees: found that stem elongation rates were doubled.

### Flowering phenological pattern in crowns of four temperate deciduous tree species and its reproductive implications
O. Tal, 2010
**Permanent notes:**
Flowering phenology is a central process in reproductive biology (primack 1985), because it interacts with sex expression by determining whether sexes co-occur and the duration of each sex phase determines its effectivity.

Time left for fruit ripening starts at the end of flowering and seed predation may be related to flowering phenology.

### Shrub expansion in tundra ecosystems: dynamics, impacts and research priorities
**Permanent notes:**
Isla H Myers-Smith, 2011

Shrubs modify many ecosystem processes including snow depth and associate hydrologic dynamics, nutrient exchange and associated net carbon balance, albedo and associated energy fluxes. At this time, there is considerable uncertainty about the magnitude and direction of these feedbacks and these processes might drive them in various directions. However, dramatic changes to shrub abundance in tundra ecosystems could result in significant alterations to the global carbon cycle. 


Temperature limits the reproduction and growth of shrub species in tundra ecosystems. The low pollen or seed viability in different populations of shrub near their range limits suggest that temperature limitaion of reproduction may determine the northern extent of many shrubs in the low Arctic. However, recruitment seems to increase in recent years in some places. It doesn't necessarily mean that it increases shrubs in tundra.

In some studies, winter temp and snow correlates with growth in the following summer. Snow melt timing determines the length of the GS and snowpack provides protection from frost damage during the winter/spring. This suggests taht warmer ocnditions will promote shrub growth either directly: physiological processes. Indirectly: enhancing soil microbial activities taht supply nutrients for shrub uptake. However, increased summer temp is also linked to moisture deficits in summer which could offset expected growth increase, which has been observed in boreal trees.

Recent research highlights that: (1) growth in shrub species is often strongly correlated with growing season temperatures; (2) disturbances such as fire and permafrost thaw can enhance shrub expansion; (3) herbivory can control shrub canopy architecture and limit expansion rates; (4) shrub canopies can alter surface albedo and increase atmospheric heating; and (5) shrub canopies can trap snow and insulate soils in the winter, yet shade soils and maintain shallower active layer depths during the summer.

### Stable isotopes in tree rings
Danny McCarroll*, Neil J. Loader, 2003
**Permanent notes:**
Chronologies with preserved trees in lakes and buildings, alongside bristlecone pines provide the basis for dendrochronological dating and were used to calibrate the radiocarbon timescale. Cite: Stuiver and Reimer, 1993

The three main elements in wood (carbon, oxygen and hydrogen) all have more than one stable (non-radioactive) isotope. Carbon, for example, has two stable isotopes, 12C and 13C, each with six protons but with either six or seven neutrons. These isotopes have almost identical chemical properties but the difference in mass allows physical, chemical and biological processes to discriminate against one of them, thereby imparting an environmental signal. 

Although the carbon of each annual tree ring has its origin in the CO2 of air, and O and H come from soil water and thus precipitation, the isotopic ratios in wood are very different to those in either air or water, so trees do not passively collect and store these elements. The primary value of the isotopic records in tree rings is not simply as samples of ancient air or water, but as sensitive bioindicators of the way that the components of air and water have been changed by the trees in response to the environments in which they lived.

We know that climate will change, but the question is how it will change in different places. Models can predict this, but we need high resolution and spatially explicit evidence of the way climate changes behaved over space and over time. This info is obtainable from stable isotopes in tree rings. 

###Timing and duration of European larch growing season along altitudinal gradients in the Swiss Alps
2009
**Permanent notes:**
Linking growth processes and changes in environmental conditions are chalenged by a limited nb of replicates and observed years.

Assessing impacts of climate change, info gained along an elevational gradient may be particularly useful because such gradients allow "space-for-time/warming experiments". This approach, long term changes in the timing and duration of tree growth per shift in degree C (=TIME) are substitudted by changes along altitudinal transects (=space)

They showed that cambial is highly responsive to spring temperatures both under artificially manipulation and natural conditions. Temperature seems to be important to set the growth start, but no effect for growth end. However, it seems taht max growth rate and growth cessation seem to be controlled by photoperiod.

### Tree and forest functioning in response to global warming
Henrik Saxe
**Permanent notes:**
Development of reproductive structures in the autumn may be entirely a function of accumulated degree-days, aka thermal time : Sarvas 1974. Thus, they can be vulnerable to damage by early frosts when development continues late in autumn. Trees can afford this risk, balancing  loss of seed in some years against the production of large, well developed seeds in others.

### Arctic amplification causes earlier onset of seasonal tree growth in northeastern Siberia
Alexander V Kirdyanov, 2024
**Permanent notes:**
Artic and subartic are warming extremely fast, which exceeds the global average temperature increase by four times. DEFINE arctic amplification: The Arctic is warming twice to three times as fast as the rest of the planet due to sea ice loss. 
 Boreal forest zone is experiencing shifts in vegetation structure and productivity, northward vegetation expansion, permafrost degradation and greenhouse gas emission from permafrost thawing. 
The dynamics of boreal forest ecosystems withing the northern tree line ecotone, the transition from northen taiga to treeless tundra is largely controlled by GS temperatures. Current warming is believed to be among the main drivers of initiating an expansion of trees into the tundra as well as forest densification within the tundra.

Rapid onset of tree cambial activity after snowmelt and increased temperature is the key adaptation at the beginning of the GS is Siberia Larch. There is a 24 h photoperiod which enables them to complete tree-ring formation within several weeks of the short GS. 

Their results show a shift in tree growth dependance on temperature to earlier dates --> earlier start of the GS. Coincides with temporal changes of 2 climate parameters that affect the timing of GS: snowmelt and temperature preceding and during early GS. Thus, they show that in Siberia, radial growth of larch mainly depends on early summer temperature. 

### Paleorecords reveal biological mechanisms crucial for reliable species range shift projections amid rapid climate change
Victor Van Der Meersch, Isabelle Chuine, 2025
**Permanent notes:**
All model performance decreased as climatic dissimilarity increased. However, this decline was lower for PEMs, which suggests that mechanistic principles may be more reliable than CSDMs in projecting future species distributions under warming conditions. This shows that the biological mechanisms should be included for future and more robust model projections. 

#### What is the most important background information/literature/findings relevant to the study? (Hint: This should be in the introduction section). 
To evaluate model reliability, we can compare predictions to observations from previous time periods i.e. hindcasting. 

We don't have exact matches of the expected 21st century warming conditions, but the dissimilarity between 20th and 21st century is similar to the range we experienced since the beginning of the Holocene: abrupt climate warming followed by a long and uninterrupted climatic stability. 

To model species distributions, we mostly used CSDMs (aka niche models) which infer statistical relationship between observations of species occurences and environmental predictors.

Alternative: process-explicit models (PEMs process based models) which rely on explicit formulations of the mechanisms driving the distribution of a given species (e.g. physiological, ecological, and or demographic process). Because they rely on biological processes, they are believed to provide more reliable predictions of species distribution changes under new climate.

We don't know wether they provide more reliable predictions than CSdms

Objectives:
1. Assess which modelling approach best predicts pas species distributions and 
2. Whether model perfomance was related to their hypotheses(relationships describing explicit bio mechanisms or not) or to their calibration methods (calibrated on species occurence data or not)

To do so, comapred 3 types of models: CSDMs, PEMs (expert PEMs) and fitted PEMs calibrated in the same way as CSDMs (inverse calibration using species occurence data and a novel type of algorithm

#### What is the major finding and why is it important?
All models showed a decrease of their performance when moving further into the past. 
Their results suggest that transferability and robustness of models are more strongly influenced by the processes explicitly represented in the models than by their method of calibration. 

PEMs may be more reliable under futur climatic conditions. Moving to what correlates with what to why and how things happen. More robust framework, grounded in mechanistic principles, for understanding and predicting species range shifts.
**PEMS provide not only more detailed mechanistic understanding of the effects of environmental conditions on species fitness, they are also more robust than CSDMs in novel climates.**
#### What are the major limitations of this study?
They can't account for long or rare dispersion events or human influence. Plus, they focused on well known tree species for which we have a lot mechanistic understanding. However, it might not be the case for a lot of species and CSDMs might be more reliable for not well understood species. 
#### Which figure do you consider the most important and why? (Max: 100 words)
Figure 3: shows that all models performance decrease with increased dissimilarity,but lower for process based models than correlative. It also shows that process models are more performant at predicting early holocene periods, but similar for mid to late holocene when there is less dissimilarity. Transferability: more transferable for early holocene when process based compared to correlative. 


### Effects of Temperature Variations and Urban Heat Island on the Seasonal Development of Woody Plants in the South of Primorsky Krai
A. A. Marchenko, 2024
**Permanent notes**:
Urban heat island (UHI) effect arises when urban areas experience higher temperatures than their rural surrounding. Urban vegetation is ahead of rural vegetation in terms of the timing of spring phenophases.

### Beyond climate change attribution in conservation and ecological research
Camille Parmesan, 2013
**Permanent notes**:
We know the attribution of global warming to greenhouse gases, but we further need to attribute biological events not merely to changing climate, but specifically to anthropogenic climate change (ACC), the component of change that has been driven by increase in GHG. \

Process based models can be developped for few species for which we have both long observational time series and experimental studies. Ecological models rely often on physiological and developmental processes that relate on temp and precip. These models can document causal relationships between observed long-term chganges in a species and regional climatic changes. E.g. causally related northward and upward range shifts of the pine moth to warming winters that enhanced survival and feeding rates.

Def:
‘Detection of change is defined as the process of demonstrating that climate or a system affected by climate has changed in some defined statistical sense, without providing a reason for that change. An identified change is detected in observations if its likelihood of occurrence by chance due to internal variability alone is determined to be small, for example, < 10%’. 
‘Attribution is defined as the process of evaluating the relative contributions of multiple causal factors to a change or event with an assignment of statistical confidence. The process of attribution requires the detection of a change in the observed variable or closely associated variables’.

Biological processes are complex and vulnerable to misinterpretation. E.g. plants growin in regional warming regions did not advance flowering, but it's because the trend was countered by an opposing response to warmer winter temps that delayed spring events. 

Inference can provide high confidence. E.g. of inferential methods: astronomers can infer the presence of invisible celestial objects (e.g. black hole) based on the behaviour of surrounding observational objects. Biological inference of ACC impacts is based on the principle of parsimony, as ACC allows for a parsimouneous explanation of the changes observatioons. 

Global meta-analyses are likely to remain the most reliable, scientifically defensible and robust set of approaches both for detection and long-term change in biodiversity and to determine the extent to which those changes can be attributed to ACC.

### Canopy structure regulates autumn phenology by mediating the microclimate in temperate forests

The intricate interplay of factors ranging from soil to atmospheric conditions generates complex efects on autumn phenology, resulting in greater inter-crown variability inn autumn than spring. This results in high uncertainty in predictions of GS length and its associated carbon sequestration capactiy of temperate forests.

Genetic variations among tree species play a big role in shaping phenotypic characteristic of trees, including autumn phenology. However, environmental may overshadow genetic influences through phenotypic plasticity. Radiation and temperature are usually the determinants of autumn phenology. Regions with cold temperature and low radiation go through senescence faster, because decreasing temperature and solar radiation can trigger the accumulation of abscisic acid, speed up chl degradation, reduce photopsyntheic enzyme activity and increase the risk of leaf frost = earlier leaf senesence.

Microclimates : localized climate conditions directly experinenced by plant organisms. At a local scale, microclimate can exhibit big spatial heterogeneities and is a critical factor of ecoystem processes.

The impact of canopy structure on Start of autumn can have 2 pathways:
1. Modulates within-canopy light conditions, subsequently photosynthesis and carbon uptake. Increased photosynthesis during GS increases carbon uptake and saturates it after reaching a critical sugar concentration in sink organs. 
Satuaration of carbon uptake can trigger photosynthetic feedback inhibition characterized by a metabolic shift to nutrient remobilizaqtion thus influencing leaf senescnce.
2. By modulating within canopy temperature conditions. Canopies can mitigate diurnal temp extremes directly by reducing daytime highs and increasing night-time lows. This temperature-buffering effect becomes stronger in structurally complex forests, thus accelarating the accrual of cold temperatures which can advance leaf senescence by increasing abscisic acid content... 
This supports the carbon-sink hypothesis is thus supported by increasing observations of negative relationships between GS productivity and leaf senescence timing 
However, their results suggest that global light index has a stronger impact on autumn timing than buffered temperature, suggesting that carbon uptake may play a more important role in regulating leaf senescnce timing than cold temp.

They observed significant effect of canopy structure on autumn phenology induced by the regulation effect of canopy structure on microclimate conditions. This provide a new perspective for interpreting the local variations of autumn phenology in temp foress.

#### From Roots to Leaves: Tree Growth Phenology in Forest Ecosystems
Roberto Silvestro, Sergio Rossi, Yann Vitasse, 2025
**Permanent notes:**
Cool picture about timeline hiustory of phenology.
Autumnal phenology and specifically budset are often used as a proxy for the end of growth. 
After exposure to chilling conditions, buds move from endodormancy to ecodormancy, during which they are able to resume growth in response to warm conditions (i.e. forcing) and increasing photoperiod. These changes yield important biochemical feedbacks on plant carbon metabolism and the non-structural carbohydrates NSC dynamics. At this stage, giberellins increases and abscisic acid decreases, cell membrane fluidity increases and influx of calcium enters the meristematic cells, eventually triggering cell elongation and division triggering budbreak.
Resumption of primary shoot growth relies on deep understandiong of physiological processes that occur during dormancy. Depending on the species:
Primary growth will either stop after a few weeks (deterministic growth)
Occur continuouslyy troughout the growing season (indeterministic growth)
Occur during several periods of intermitent growth (polycyclic growth). This one allows a ceretain species to increase their resistance and flexibility to stress, such as drought, since they can re-flush once teh stress is releases and conditions become favourable again. 

Wood growth phenology aka wood formation or xylogenesis refers to the timing of physiological phases occuring throughout the seasonal growth of wood in terms of both volume and mass. 
Formation of the xylem (or growth rings) begins with cambial reactivation and cell production by cambial initals. Subsequent stages involve the differentiation of xylem cells , encopmpassing discrete events:
1. Cell enlargement 
2. Secondary wall formation and lignification 
3. Programmed cell-death
The different timings betwen theses phases constrain the overall length of the wood growin season. 

Most studies have focused on conifers rather than angiosperms. Partly due to the simpler wood structure of conifers which is composed of approximately 90% tracheids. Angiosperms are more complex: vessels, fibers and in some species, tracheids. 

Cambial activity marks the initial phase of wood formation,  characterized by reactivatiopn of the cambium, which is a layer of meristematic cells (i.e. cambial initials) that produces new xylem and phloem cells. In spring, when temperatures rise above 4-5 C, cambium can resume. Warming experiments support the importance of temperature on cambial activity.

Photoperiod also plays an important role in xylem cell production. Rossi et al. found that the maximum rate of xylem production tops at summer solstice, when day length, NOT tempereature reaches its peak. After the solstice, cell production diminishes and eventually ceases. Suggests that trees evolved to synchronize their phenology and growth rates with day length, providing an advbantage in avoiding thermally unfavorable growth periods at the beginnning and ending of the season. 

Water availability also plays a crucial role in defining phenology and dynamics of wood formation. E.g. mediteranean ecosystems, two peak of secondary growth activity: spring and autumn. This bimodal growth pattern is associated with changes in growth conditions where water stress suspends wood formation in the summer. During autumn, reactivation of growth in response to precipitation allows resumption of xylem cell differentiation and sometimes, cambial activity.

### Tree rings provide a new class of phenotypes for genetic associations that foster insights into adaptation of conifers to climate change
Johann Housset, 2017
**Permanent notes:**
already in slipbox
However, in tree species, the list of functional traits that closely reflect adaptation to climate is still rather limited and labor-intensive to evaluate (for a review, see Aitken & Bemmels, 2016). In particular, assessment of dendrometric traits usually consists of punctual measurements (e.g. height or diameter at a certain age) that are probably the cumulative result of many different climatic events and constraints that occurred throughout the tree’s lifespan.
### Global patterns of mobile carbon stores in trees at the high-elevation tree linege
Christian Korner, 2012
**Permanent notes:**
Architecture and associated aerodynamics are the primary reasons why trees are more strongly affected by low temp at lower elevations than smaller stature plants.
They show that the cessation of growth in the cold in tree lines ecotones is not limited by carbon limitation. Plus, they argue that sink limitation is not a consequence of insufficient soil-nutrient availability in the cold but a direct limitation of meristmatic processes. So far, malnutrition has been identified at the tree line. 

### Global warming-related tree growth decline and mortality on the north-eastern Tibetan plateau
Eryuan Liang, 2016
**Permanent notes:**
In many forests worldwide, drought and warming have caused reductions in annual stem increment and productivity.

Spruce in the Tibetan plateau show increased tree mortality of adult trees, but it's not accompanied by increasing recruitment rates which suggests that recent climate change is not accompanied by increasing recruitment rates. They suggest that CC type drought is driving spruce forests beyond the point of ecosystem resilience and toward stand level deforestation.

### On the Below- and Aboveground Phenology in Deciduous Trees: Observing the Fine-Root Lifespan, Turnover Rate, and Phenology of Fagus sylvatica L., Quercus robur L., and Betula pendula Roth for Two Growing Seasons
Bertold Mariën, 2021
**Permanent notes:**
We should define roots on a physiological basis and not on morphology.
Fine-roots can add nutrients adn carbon into the soil throught their continuous growth and mortality. Fine root turnover rate: number of times in which the fine-root biomass is replaced within a given timeframe. This turnover account for 10 to 60% of the annual NPP in forests globally. 

We know very little on the phenology of fine-roots in deciduous trees. There are 3 reasons we know less for bellow than above ground dynamics:
1. Difficult to estimate fine-root lifespan, turover rate and phenology
2. A lot of inter-annual variations within and among species, with very few trends.
3. Distribution of root types and corresponding root characteristics show significant spatial variability

They show that fine-roots of late successional species live longer than those of pioneer species.

They didn't show any yearly patterns in belowground phenology of beech, oak or birch and no coupling between the below and above ground phenology of these species.

### Warm springs alter timing but not total growth of temperate deciduous trees
Cameron Dow, Neil Pederson
**Permanent notes:**
Despite deforestation, the net effect of forests in still a carbon sink i.e. they are absorbing more CO2 than they are releasing despite the deforestation and land use changes. This is because forests are growing more i.e. more CO2 absorption. This absorption offsets about 20% of human caused-CO2 ewmissions. 
Of this important carbon sink, 47% happens in temperate forests.

Earlier initiation of growth doesn't necessarily translate to earlier, faster or greater stem growth. Rather, stem growth is dependant on environemental conditions on hourly to daily timescales and annual growth is more closely linked to conditions within the growin seaosn than to growing season length. 

Plus, growth of broaleaf deciduous trees may be sink saturated, such that longer GS with more carbon fixation do not necessarily augment growth. 

Tree-ring records can examine annual growth but not growth seasonality. This reveals that gowth of temperate deciduous trees tends to be most sensitive to temperature or potential evapotranspiration between late spring and early summer. Some evidence suggest that warmer springs mayu have a modest positive effect on growth. W	hich does not align with the findings that warming spring temperatures increase anual forest CO2 uptake in temp deciduous forests. Further readings:

McMahon, S. M. & Parker, G. G. A general model of intra-annual tree growth using dendrometer bands. Ecol. Evol. 5, 243–254 (2015).*

Methods:
The yearly analysis of growth was performed separately between ring-porous and diffuse-porous species because they differ in their timing of growth.
To test if warm spring temperatures might result in storage of non-structural carbogydrates that would augment growth the folllowing year, they extended the analysis to examine correlations between Ring width index(RWI) and Tmax of the previous year. 

Their results show  that warmer spring temperatures in the temperate deciduous forests of eastern North America advance the timing of stem diameter growth but have little effect on annual increments

Their results are contradicting the concept that an earlier start to growth would increase anual NPP, they show that warm springs either speeds up the deceleration of stem expansion or otherwise fail to translate extended GS into increased stem growth, thus having negligible effect on totral annual growth for most species and locations. Thus, the decelaration of stem expansion which occurs in mid-summer near the time of peak canopy greenness is driven by cues other than photosynthate limitation, such as water stress, nutrient limitation, day length or sink limitation of stem growth. This supports the evidence of a sink limitation of stem growth, in which CC factors known to enhance photosynthesis, sich as longer GS or increased CO2, does NOT correspond to increased stem growth. 

It remains possible that warming spring temperatures could ultimately increase ANPP, through indirect mechanisms. And understanding how warming spring temperatures are influencing carbon allocaiton within ecosystems remains 

The timing of peak growth in June and July conincides with the timing of the greatest sensitive of annual growth to Tmax. Consistent with the finding that demonstrates the sensitivity of growth to drought stress or high temperatures during the peak GS

### Why longer seasons with climate change may not increase tree growth
**Permanent Notes:** 
E.M. Wolkovich, Janneke Hille Ris Lambers

Recent work (good citations here) question the assumption that longer GS increase tree growth. These studies include observations along elevational and latitudinal gradients, classic experiments in lab settings (good old paper here) to trends in ecosystem fluxes with warming.  This disconnect can be explained by diverse mechanisms from the complex nature of CC (drought/heat stress) to internal limits on plant growht. 

Small scale field warming studies find that phenologically advancing species also grow more with warming (link to cleland 2012). Observationally, there is a similar trend.

Most studies in the paper tested the hypothesis that longer seasons with CC increase growth via either increased time to grow or because longer seasons are usually warmer. 

Some studies tested the hypothesis that high temp paired with low precip produce negative correlatons of season length with growth. Some experimental and wood phenology (xylogenesis) studies suggested fundamental internal constraints that prevent trees from responding to longer seasons, yet these hypothesis have been tested in radically different ways and on different species!

Mechanisms that can limit/disrupt the positive effects opf longer GS fall into 2 categories: 
1. External factors: drought which could impact ecosystem-level trends at regional scales
2. Internal physiological constraints: which could be universal accross plants (E.g. zophner 2023).

External drivers: temp too low or too warm (35-45C) can slow down bio processes/lead to tissue death.

Internal constraints: when and how growth is initiated and ceases is under genetic and developmental control, and thus plant's internal programming could limit growth responses to longer seasons. We know that populations vary in their growth and its responses to extended seasons, reflecting differences in genetic and developmental controls that likely evolved to limit tissue loss to rare early or late-season events.
Populations vary predictably in their end-of-season phenology with more poleward going through budset earlier. This means that longer seasons are generally driven by spring phenology which appears far more flexible and advanced more rapidly than fall events

Trade-offs between vegetative and reproductive investments may produce important growth response differences across years within individuals, as well as betwen species. Years of high reproductive output can reduce growth. For species that mast, high reprod copuld especially impact measures of wood growth. Higher temp may trigger masting in the following year; if true, then reduced growth in years following warm summers may not indicate temperatures too high for grwoth, but instead shifting investment to reproduction

Wood growth in evergreen species is generally thought to come from current season photosynthesate while deciduous species may more often use stored carbon resources. These diffeernces would suggest that season length by growth relationships may be more apparent via lagged effects in deciduous species, but this is rarely studied and not well supported.

Species that budburst earlier and more readily produce addtional leaves (e.g. leaf flush after budset) may grow more with longer seasons vs those that budburst later and flush with primary growth only once. Also, species that vary in their tresholds accross their ranges mnay obscure any overall relationship between growth and GS length. 

Phylogenetic comparative methods can moved research away from treating species identify as simple groups e.g. fagus sylvatica, quercus robur) or into big groups(evergreen vs deciduous). They now treat species as a suite of correlated observations, separated by their evolutionary distance. 

While juvenile trees are more flexible than their adult forms, they usually provide predictable inference in differences across species and populations, so should be integrated into studies.

Experiments could also inform a better model of lag effects across species, with small scale studies sampling saplings multiple years after manipulation (vs common pratice of destroying samples)

### Advances in breeding phenology outpace latitudinal and elevational shifts for North American birds tracking temperature
Montague H C Neate-Clegg 
#### Paper notes for cons310. 
With ongoing climate change, species must move, adapt or face extinction. Poweward latitudinal shifts are estimated to be occuring at 16.9 km per decade. However, many stydies find that shift rates lag behind our expectations based on teh rate of shifting thermal envelopes. The failure to predict shifts is might be attributed to a combination of other factors, such as precipitation gradients, biotic interactions, dispersal limitation or land-use change.

Beyond the spatial dimensions, species are also responding to CC by shfting in time so they can track warming temperatures and resource peaks.

Phenological shifts are often considered adaptive in terms of resource tracking, but rarely considered as an alternative to shifts in latitude/elevation. 

Despite the consistency of phenological shifts, some species are not able to fully track warming temperatures


### What is the most important background information/literature/findings relevant to the study? (Hint: This should be in the introduction section). 
As climates warm, birds must track changing temperatures to prevent extirpation via spatial (latitude/elevation) or temporal (phenology) shifts. However, observed shift rates lag expectations, likely because single-dimensional spatial assessments underestimate species’ multidimensional climate responses.
### What is the major finding and why is it important?
Bird species are tracking warming temperature by advancing their breeding phenology at a faster rate than latitudinal or elevational shifts. This is important because it implies that phenological shifts could offer species an opportunity to maintain their thermal niche without having to move out of their current range. 

### What are the major limitations of this study?
While keeping the three dimensions to explain temperature tracking draws a more representative portrait, precipitation gradients and other adaptations (e.g. microclimate or morphology) could also affect temperature tracking. Also, since they rely on observational rather than experimental data, they lack an understanding of the underlying mechanisms that explain temperature tracking.

### Which figure do you consider the most important and why? (Max: 100 words)

Fig3a is a good visualization showing how breeding phenology contributes most to temperature tracking, yet most temperature tracking remains deficient. This underscores the critique that single-dimension studies (e.g. spatial shifts alone) fail to represent how species track warming temperature. Also, most species display the overall positive temperature tracking trend, but also shows that some species have a negative meaning that some species are shifting in the opposite direction of what is expected with warming temperature. Thus the figure shows that a better understanding of the mechanisms that drive species to track warming temperature is necessary to understand how they will respond to future warming temperature.

1 What is the most important background information/literature/
findings relevant to the study
As climates warm, birds must track changing temperatures via spatial (latitude/elevation) or tem-
poral (phenology) shifts to prevent climate extirpation. However, observed shift rates lag behind
expectations, likely because previous studies focused on a single spatial gradient rather than both
latitude and elevation along with temporal shifts.
2 What is the major finding and why is it important?
Bird species are tracking warming temperature by advancing their breeding phenology at a faster
rate than latitudinal or elevational shifts. This is important because it implies that phenological
shifts could give species an opportunity to maintain their thermal niche without having to move
out of their current range.

While keeping the three dimensions to explain temperature tracking draws a more representative
portrait, precipitation gradients and other adaptations (e.g. microclimate or morphology) could
also affect species’ response to warming temperature. Also, since they rely on observational rather
than experimental data, they lack an understanding of the underlying mechanisms that explain
temperature tracking.

Fig3a is a good visualization showing that breeding phenology contributes the most to temperature
tracking, yet most temperature tracking remains deficient. This underscores the critique that
single-dimension studies (e.g. spatial shifts alone) fail to represent how species track warming
temperature. Also, most species display the overall positive temperature tracking trend, but also
shows that some species have a negative meaning that some species are not shifting or in the
opposite direction of what is expected with warming temperature (Fig3b). Thus, understanding
the mechanisms that drive species to track warming temperature is crucial to predict how they will
respond to future warming temperature.
