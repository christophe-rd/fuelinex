### Convergence of leaf‐out towards minimum risk of freezing damage in temperate trees

Leaf-out occurs when the probability to encounter freezing damage approaches zero irrespective of climatic conditions (low vs high elevation) and species (early- and late-flushing species.

In other words, trees leaf out precisely at the beginning of the probabilistically safe period.

Species with a small safety margin against freezing (*define safety margin*) like F. Sylvatica, employ photoperiod co-control of spring phenology. Species with a large safety margin depend more on temperature.\

Species that employ photoperiod co-control of leaf-out (E.g. F. Sylvatica) can leaf-out closer to the period with a high probability of freeing damage than species relying more strongly on temperature controle.

### Effects of Genetic Perturbation on Seasonal Life History Plasticity
##### Permanent notes: 
Amity Wilczek et al. 2009

They showed that A. thaliana ecotypes can't be divided into 2 discrete classes of winter-annual and rapid-cyling genotypes. Rather, most ecotypes may be capable of both life histories but vary in the sensitivity and timing of the rapid transition between them. Natural variation in flowering pathways may have the greatest phenotypic expression and exposure to antural selection in climates that permit late-summer germination.

### European deciduous trees exhibit similar safety margins against damage by spring freeze events along elevational gradients

A major part of freeing resistance is to maintain membrane fluidity during the freezing process and to tolerate freezing-induced dehydration in the cell plasma.

To do this, plants synthesize dehydrings and antifreeze proteins and reduce the amount of membrane-located carriers and receptors during the pre-hardening stage in late autumn. Next, plants change the ultrastucture of the cytoplasm and increase the proline and polyol concentrations during the early stage of hardening. The final stage of hardening is reached by a repeated exposure to freezing temperatures during dormancy in winter, leading to species-specific freezing rsistance.

In spring, when the leaves emerge, they loose irreversibly their freezing resistance.

By the end of summer, after budset, the freezing resistance begins to increase again in response to shortening photoperiod and decreasing temperature.

Species range limits are driven by a trade-off between growing season length and escape from damaging freezing events.

They show that freezing events across elevations are such a strong selective pressure  that trees delay flushing until they are safe from damage caused by freezing temperatures.

Delays of leaf unfolding are reported and it is such taht the period available to recover from spring frost damage becomes much shorter at high elevations. Thus it would explain why common garden using elevation gradients showed different spring phenology irrespective of actual weather.

Thus, a short GS limits fruit ripening and seed maturation, potentially shaping northern distribution limits.\

In addition to seed maturation, latitudinal tree species distribution has been sugested to be limited by min. metabolic requirements to fulfil life history traits.

Tree species differ in their min. requirement of GSL that enables them to complete their annual life cycle successfully with respect to species-specific life history traits, e.g. seed related traits, wood anatomy,bud formation or leaf traits. Thus, species-specific min. GSL may bee the ultimate range-limiting factor.

Genomic evidence for West Antarctic Ice Sheet collapse during the Last Interglacial
####**Permanent notes:**
**Note**: for CONS310

CC is causing rapid changes in Antartica including Antarctic Ice Sheet mass loss, with global impacts:

1. Incertainty in sea level rise projections
2. Marine based West Antartic Ice Sheet (WAIS) lost 160 gigatons of ice mass/year between 1979 and 2017
3.  It will continue to be a major contributor to Global Mean Sea Level (GMSL) rise under all 	CO2 emission scenarios
4. Unclear whether WAIS is vulnerable to rapid ice loss or full collapse as a result of poor understanding of futur changes.
 
  WAIS collapse could raise global sea level to 3.3 to 5 meters

In the Pleistoncene, summer temperature were much hotter and sea level were higher. There is no evidence whether WAIS completely collapsed at any time in the three million years since the Pliocene

**Research problem:** Knowledge on how the WAIS was configured during super interglacial in the geological pasts is needed for futur sea leve prjections. 

They can use population genomics to serve as proxies of past changes. Collapse. of WAIS would have opened pathways to benthic organisms thus leaving genomic signatures. 

#### – Answer what major question does the paper address and why is this question important.
Can population genomics help understanding if WAIS will fully collapse under current climate warming scenarios?
####- Outline the general approach (methods) used (sometimes you may want to diagram this).
Target capture approach that sequenced genome-wide, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data in the circum-Antarctic benthic octopus Pareledone turqueti. 96 individuals. The samples are from AS and EA over 33 years.

Genome sequencing SNPs derived from double-digest restriction site-associated DNA loci

Their data set presents an overview of the species' genetic pattern and any historical connectivity that would be associated with past trans-West Antarctic seaways.#### – Understand the figures and what they show.
