### Convergence of leaf‐out towards minimum risk of freezing damage in temperate trees
##### Permanent notes: 
Armando Lenz, Christian Korner, Yann Vitasse, Sabrina Russo. 2016
Leaf-out occurs when the probability to encounter freezing damage approaches zero irrespective of climatic conditions (low vs high elevation) and species (early- and late-flushing species.

In other words, trees leaf out precisely at the beginning of the probabilistically safe period.

Species with a small safety margin against freezing (*define safety margin*) like F. Sylvatica, employ photoperiod co-control of spring phenology. Species with a large safety margin depend more on temperature.\

Species that employ photoperiod co-control of leaf-out (E.g. F. Sylvatica) can leaf-out closer to the period with a high probability of freeing damage than species relying more strongly on temperature controle.

### Effects of Genetic Perturbation on Seasonal Life History Plasticity
##### Permanent notes: 
Amity Wilczek et al. 2009

They showed that A. thaliana ecotypes can't be divided into 2 discrete classes of winter-annual and rapid-cyling genotypes. Rather, most ecotypes may be capable of both life histories but vary in the sensitivity and timing of the rapid transition between them. Natural variation in flowering pathways may have the greatest phenotypic expression and exposure to antural selection in climates that permit late-summer germination.

### European deciduous trees exhibit similar safety margins against damage by spring freeze events along elevational gradients
##### Permanent notes: 
Yann Vitasse, Christian Korner, 2013

A major part of freeing resistance is to maintain membrane fluidity during the freezing process and to tolerate freezing-induced dehydration in the cell plasma.

To do this, plants synthesize dehydrings and antifreeze proteins and reduce the amount of membrane-located carriers and receptors during the pre-hardening stage in late autumn. Next, plants change the ultrastucture of the cytoplasm and increase the proline and polyol concentrations during the early stage of hardening. The final stage of hardening is reached by a repeated exposure to freezing temperatures during dormancy in winter, leading to species-specific freezing rsistance.

In spring, when the leaves emerge, they loose irreversibly their freezing resistance.

By the end of summer, after budset, the freezing resistance begins to increase again in response to shortening photoperiod and decreasing temperature.

Species range limits are driven by a trade-off between growing season length and escape from damaging freezing events.

They show that freezing events across elevations are such a strong selective pressure  that trees delay flushing until they are safe from damage caused by freezing temperatures.

Delays of leaf unfolding are reported and it is such taht the period available to recover from spring frost damage becomes much shorter at high elevations. Thus it would explain why common garden using elevation gradients showed different spring phenology irrespective of actual weather.

Thus, a short GS limits fruit ripening and seed maturation, potentially shaping northern distribution limits.\

In addition to seed maturation, latitudinal tree species distribution has been sugested to be limited by min. metabolic requirements to fulfil life history traits.

Tree species differ in their min. requirement of GSL that enables them to complete their annual life cycle successfully with respect to species-specific life history traits, e.g. seed related traits, wood anatomy,bud formation or leaf traits. Thus, species-specific min. GSL may bee the ultimate range-limiting factor.

### Genomic evidence for West Antarctic Ice Sheet collapse during the Last Interglacial
#### Permanent notes: 
CC is causing rapid changes in Antarctica including Antarctic Ice Sheet mass loss, with global impacts:

1. Uncertainty in sea level rise projections
2. Marine-based West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) lost 160 gigatons of ice mass/year between 1979 and 2017
3.  It will continue to be a major contributor to Global Mean Sea Level (GMSL) rise under all 	CO2 emission scenarios
4. Unclear whether WAIS is vulnerable to rapid ice loss or full collapse as a result of poor understanding of futur changes.
 
  WAIS collapse could raise global sea level to 3.3 to 5 meters

In the Pleistocene, summer temperatures were much hotter and sea level were higher. There is no evidence whether WAIS completely collapsed at any time in the three million years since the Pliocene
WAIS collapsed when global mean surface temperature  (GMST) was 0.5 to 1.5 C than the preindustrial. This suggests that the tipping point of future WAIS collapse is close. This will bring an significant increase in GMSL

###Potential for evolutionary responses to climate change – evidence from tree populations

FLORIAN J. ALBERTO, 2013
#### Permanent notes:
Populations can respond to environmental change through phenotypic plasticity, by moving to a new area corresponding to environmental conditions they are adapted to, by genetically adapting to the new conditions, or by a combinations of these responses.
Local adapation is more common in trees than in some other plant species. Trees are adapted to the current climate and they are thus potentially greatly influenced by the rapid changes in climate.

The long generation times are a challenge in tree research but they also provide adavantages:
1. Adaption to CC depends on phenotypic traits relevant to new environments such as timinign of growth and drought or cold tolerance and we have a low of into on quantittative genetics and population idfferenetiation of trees because of the 250 years of forestry provenance trials.
2. The demographic history since the last glaciual maximum has been reconstructed for a lot of species by combining phylogeographic and palynological approaches (*define this in a new note) with coalescent-based studies of population demogrpahy. Rates of past adaptation to CC can be infered from these studies. 

CC may result in the intro of new pests, e.g. mountain pine beetle or new pathogens, but also losses of current competittos, insects or diseases caused e.g. by phenological shifts between trees and associated pests. 

Pheno shifts with increased temperature : (Menzel & Fabian, 1999; Menzel et al., 2006; Parmesan, 2006)

Cool table describing linear regressions of 1. bud flush and 2. budset along altitudinal and latitudinal gradients. It shows that the 2 pheno traits differ in their patterns. For bud flush, both altitudinal and latitudinal clines showed similar shallow slopes, but the direction of adaptation varied greatly among species. E.g. pop from high altitude Q. petrae flushed late whereas F. Sylvatica flushed early. Reflects tradeoff between max growing season and spring frost. 
Bud set showed steeper slopes for both gradients and in all species more northern or higher altitude populations had earlier bud set. This indicates that differentail selection on bud set is systematically stronger than on bud flush. Bud flush may display higher phenotypic plasticity as temperatures increase. 

Spring a warming climate, spring phenology can likely respond and advance without much genetic change as has already been seen in many species, provided than chilling requirements are met. 

Criticism: commercially less important species are poorly represented in previously established common gardens regarless of having wide or small ranges. Small range species are more vulnerable. 

### Dominant radial and height growth reveal comparable historical variations for common beech in north-eastern France
Jean-Daniel Bontemps, 2010
**Permanent notes:**
The accuracy of radial growth is questioned for investigating past forest productivity changes. 
1. Radial growth of individual trees is sensitive to local competition dynamics driven by natural disturbances or sylviculture in managed ecosystems. These processes are independant of site fertility conditions, radial growth of trees isn't considered a good indicator of stand productivty potential in forestry compared to mean height. Sampling of trees is usually restricted to dominant trees which experience lower competition intensity and belong to a fairly stable population over time. 
2. Radial growth is usually sampled at breast height. During severe climatic events, ring width reduction may be acute at breast height compared to other positions. Such events modify the relationship between ring size and tree volume increment. 

### Observed forest sensitivity to climate implies large changes in 21st century North American forest growth
Noah D. Charney,, 2016
**Permanent notes:**
The degree to which increased atmospheric CO2 will increase future plant growth (i.e. carbon fertilisation) remains an important unresolved effect. Different pathways can be taken to influence growth and tehse effectsa re integfrated within metrics of water-use efficiency (WUE). Increased WUE has been invoked to explain opbservations such as accelerated growth in free-air carbon enrichment experiments,but its role in reducing water-stress is not clear.
### Xylogenesis: Coniferous Trees of Temperate Forests Are ListeningtotheClimateTaleduringtheGrowingSeason But Only Remember the Last Words!
Henri E. Cuny
**Permanent notes:**
Wood formation (xylogenesis) can generate various wood forms in response to developmental or environmental constraints. Wood anatomy can be observed between different phylogenetic groups.
Wood anatomy is known toa dapt to changes in environmental conditions in space or time. Some of the most spectacular variations in wood anatomy occur in a single tree ring. E.g. in confiers, the diameter and wall thickness of the most abundant cells (tracheids) are divided and multipilied by 5 when going from the beginning to the end of a tree ring. Usually well ordered along treee rings and more or less progressive. 

Plant development reslts in changes in signal concentration or in tissue sensitivity through the GS creating the typical tree-ring structure. May be tied to daylength

In contrast, the environmental theory proposes that the within-ring anatomical changes are driven mainly by climatic constraints. 

Cell enlargement is the plant process the most sensitive to water stress. Long lasting belief that decreasing water availability triggers the transition from wide earlywood cells to the narrow latewood cells (Good refs but don't tell if the belief is still accurate). In contrast, wall thickening involves numerous and complex metabolic processes which are considerted the most sensitive to temperature amopn all the physiological processes related to tree carbon balance.

### Growth variations of Common beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) under different climatic and environmental conditions in EuropeÐa dendroecological study
Christoph Dittmar
**Permanent notes:**
Dendrochronological studies on beech. Good description of their methods.
Chronologies are of good quality if they have the following features:
1. High average cross-correlation for ring series derived from trees within the site
2. High mean sensitivity (relative to year to year variability
3. High percentage of common variance of the components represented in the standardiozed stand chronology 
4. 4. Low first-order serial correlation

They recommend dendrochronological investigations with temporal and spatial comparisons to prove environmenetal impacts on forest growth and vitality. 

### Severe drought can delay autumn senescence of silver birch in the current year but advance it in the next year
Inge Dox, Matteo Campioli
**Permanent notes:**
For the Silver birch used in the study (in norway), cambial activation occurred by the end of April and bud burst occured about 2 weeks before cambial reactivation. But another year, it was the opposite. 

Cambium reactivation took place or before budburst depending on the year. This can be because of birch's diffuse-porous character. Likely, not all conduits are fully embolized in birch in winter and it si therefore not necessary for birch to produce new condutis before leaf expansion in spring. (Are all birches diffuse-porous). Another study in Belgium on birches also found that cambium reactivation took place 19 days before budburst.

Cambial reactivation can take place before bud-burst as trees can use carbohydrate reserves from previous year to fuel the new wood growth. 

They showed that severe summer drought induce an advancement of the cessation of wood growth. 

The onset of loss canopy greenesss was delayed by summer drought. It's in contrast with the litterature where one possibility is that leaf mortality occured earlier than the start of their obervations. Can be because trees drought stressed would have triggered a delayed senescence to enhance carbon assimilation. 

They didn't see a lag effect of drought on the cessation of wood growth of the next year.

Difference in tree-ring width can be the result of 4 things:
1. early cambium reactivation in 2018
2. Deficit in carbohydrates of reserves in 2018 negatively affecting wood growth the following year. 
3. Fast-wood production during the spring 
4. Presence of tension wood overestimating the tree-ring width in that year.

### Species specific growth responses of black spruce and trembling aspen may enhance resilience of boreal forest to climate change
Igor Drobyshev and Yves Bergeron, 2013
**Permanent notes**
Dendroclimatic studies suggest that aspen growth is mostly influenced by climatic conditions of the year prior to growth. 

Differences in climate-growth relationships between spruce and aspen during non-anomalous weather ( periods dominated by weather conditions only moderately deviating from respective long-term means), suggests that growth responses may also differ between species during climatically extreme growing seasons.
Methods:
To obtain growth chronologies with amplified high-frequency variability, the series were detrended in the ARSTAN program, using a 32-year cubic smoothing spline with a 50% frequency response (Speer 2010)
For aspens, extremely cold summers limited trees' physiological activity and resulted in consistently negative growth anomalies. This is caused by link between growth rate and tree viability. Years with severe environemntal activity manifest itself in the tree ring record as pointer years and have been shown to cause long-term declines in tree growth and delayed mortality. 
Future climate will exhibit higher frequency of climatic extremes and the mixed stands may show a higher resilience under the future climates than monodominate communities. They conclude this from the evidence of the spatial and temporal niche separation between aspen and black spruce. 
###Influence of annual weather on growth of pedunculate oak in southern Sweden
Igor Drobyshev, 2008
**Permanent notes:**
The growth of Pedunculate oak in Europe is negatively affected by summer drought and spring frost. A study of pan-European oak pointer years was able to link them with period of temperature and precipitation anomales controlled by the North-Atlantic and Arctic circulation patterns. 
Positiver growth anomalies were assocaited with extended periods of increased soil-water avalilability. Negative anomalies were realted to periods of lower air temperatures and reduced soil moisture. However, these studies focused on the effect of climatic extremes with no comparison with climatic controles over growth during climatic extremes and non-extremes years. 

In germany, Pedunculate oak and European beech have show that much lesser growth response of oak trees to drought as compared with European beech, which might reflect the differences in root systems of these two species. 

### Evolutionary and plastic responses to climate change in terrestrial plant populations
Steven J. Franks, Sally Aitken, 2013
**Permanent notes:**
As climate changes, plant populations may no longer be optimally adapted to new conditions. Migration could a llow some populations to track suitable conditions and thus maintain their adaptive optimum. However, this might be hard in fragmented landscapes and for species with long generation lengths.

Migration may allow a pop to stay in its climatic envelope but cause it to be out of synch with other environmental factors such as photoperiod or key mutualists such as pollinators. 

Two meta-analysis of receiprocal transplant studies, one with 35 studies of plants have found that local adaptation is common but not universal with 71% of studies showing some evidence of local adaptation.

Many tree species hav e shown strong evidence of local adaptataion to climate in provenacne experiments., which are common egarden experiments testing the provenance on tree survival, growth rates and other phenotypic traists. In a mewta an analysis of provenacne experiments for 59 tree species and 19 phenotypic traits, 90% of analyses found significant population differentiation for phenotypic traits and in most cases, this differentation was correlated with and attributed to variaton in climate.  Alberto and al. 2013.

Dendrochrnology studies can be used to asssess variation in tree rings in common garden experiments although ontogenetic effects of aging need to be separated from effects of temporal fluctuation in climate. 

Tree ring data from The Illingworth lodgepole pine provenance trial shows that average tree ring widths shows strong interactions between mean temperature of population origins and mean temperature of test sites, reflecting local adaptation and strong effects of site temperature and moisture --> phenotypic plasticity. Annual variation in ring width (climatic sensitivity showed weaker effects of site climate and provenance climate than average ring width.

The studies they examined all showed of phenological phenotypic plasticity. 

Vitasse et al 2010 showed that an elevational reciprocal transplant study of two European deciduous tree species, both timing of leaf emergence and senescence showed greater variation due to phenotypic plastricity than genetic differences. The most delayed senescence (non-linear) was in intermediate thermal environments. Likely the result of moisture dewficits resulting in premature senescence at high temperatures and resulted in a nonlinear reaction norm between temp and GS length for all populations. 

###Sensitivity of leaf unfolding to experimental warming in three temperate tree species
Ivan A. Janssens, 2013
**Permanent notes:**
Observed phenological trends in the last decades cannot be directly be used to extrapolate future pheno changes because the mechanisms guiding them aren't clear and because pheno responses of trees to warming may not be linear. Indeed, accurate predictions require an in-depth accurate mecchanistic understanding of leaf unfolding process and its sensitivity to environmental drivers, especially temperature and photoperiod. 

Stages of leaf unfolding process:
1. bud dormancy needs to be broken by exposure to cold temperatures during winter (chilling). A certain number of chilling units (i.e. function of daily temp (chilling days model) or  of hourly temperature (chilling hours model) below a cold treshold needs to be accumulated. 
2. Once sufficient chilling has been accumulated, the second phase of dormancy is achieved. Sufficient warmth is needed to trigger bud burst, refered to as forcing. Requirements of forcing is either linked to a linear tempearture relation above a given temperature treshold or a sigmoid temperature function. Thus, the interaction of chilling and forcing requirements with temperature determines the tioming of leaf unfolding. 

Warming trend increased forcing temperature accumulation, while in most boreal and temperate regions, winters are still sufficiently cold to ensure adequate chilling.

###Global variation in thermal tolerances and vulnerability of endotherms to climate change
**Permanent notes :**
Birds seem to lab behind in tracking their climatic envelopes via shifts of their geographiocal ranges. It might suggests that birds may either be able to adapt rapidly to novel environemental conditions or the level of CC does not exceed their tolerance limits. 

Their results support that birds thermal physiology is more directly linked to their ambien climatic conditions than mammal. The later can build burrows and dens to create their preferred microclimates unlike most species of birds.

### Comparison of the timing of spring phenological events between phenological garden trees and wild populations
Calum J. Sweeney, Astrid Wingler, 2023
**Permanent notes :**
Advancing spring phenology can extend the GS, and increase carbon uptake. But it recent research suggeests that it may not be sequestrated in wood, casting doubt on the long-term carbon sink arrising from phenological change.

Their results suggest taht genetic factors are the most likely cause for the different phenological timing between the clones and wild populations.

There is a relationship between size and phenological timing where young trees leaf out earlier to take advantage of vernal light in woodland understories in spring. They highlight the importance of taking tree size and age intop account when interpretating pheno garden data.

### Day length unlikely to constrain climate-driven shifts in leaf-out times of northern woody plants
Constantin Zohner, Susanne Renner, 2016
**Permanent notes :** 
photoperiod limitation: idea that plant sensitivity to day length protects leaves against frost damage by guiding budburst into a safe time period. Experiments show that day length sensitive species react to spring temperatures only once day length increases. --? d-l senstive species may not react to warmer temperatures. 

They showed a negative correlation between species' reliance on day length as a leaf-out signal and the winter duration in their native ranges. Two possible mechanisms on how photoperiod perception in plants may interact with warmin requirements:
- Either plants need to reach a fixed photoperiod treshold before they perceive spring temperatures
	Trees from longer winter region would have longer photoperiod tresholds because days are already long when min temp cross freezing treshold.
- Forcing requirements gradually decrease with increasing photoperiod.
	Photoperiod as a budburst regulator is less important in regions with long winters because days in spring are long before the risk the risk of frost has past. 
	
### Determination of intraspecific variation in seed weight, leaf functional traits, and sapling size of Betula ermanii using a common garden experiment
Aye Myat Myat Paing, 2021
**Permanent notes :** 
Common garden experiments and provenance trials can help determine the genetic control of phenotypic traits. 

### Differential responses to changes in growth temperature between trees from different functional groups and biomes: a review and synthesis of data
DANIELLE A. WAY, 2010
**Permanent notes :** 
Dendrochronology studies have found a positive relationship between growth and warmer growing seaons, hwoerver, increasing temperatures since the 1950s have a lower than expected effect in a lot of Northern hemispehere species. This switch in growth response to temp in tree ring studies is known as the divergence problem. 

Causes of divergence problem:
- Drought stress in summer. E.g. Sierra Nevada increased mortality of fir and pine trees between 1980 and 2004 correlated with increasing temperatures
- Shorter GS caused by increased snowfall and thus later snowmelt.
- Summer temperatures are exceeding the thermal optimum for growth. 

Trees from colder environments may benefit from some degree of climate warming, but not the species from warmer climates.

Why is growth enhanced at higher temperature? Biochemical processes such as photosynthesis and respiration are enhanced at higher temperatures because of quicker enzyme function. Acclimatation may also increase performance. 

Leaf traits were linked to changes in daytime temperature.

High temperatures increase shoot elongation rates in crops and in trees: found that stem elongation rates were doubled.

### Flowering phenological pattern in crowns of four temperate deciduous tree species and its reproductive implications
O. Tal, 2010
**Permanent notes:**
Flowering phenology is a central process in reproductive biology (primack 1985), because it interacts with sex expression by determining whether sexes co-occur and the duration of each sex phase determines its effectivity.

Time left for fruit ripening starts at the end of flowering and seed predation may be related to flowering phenology.

### Shrub expansion in tundra ecosystems: dynamics, impacts and research priorities
**Permanent notes:**
Isla H Myers-Smith, 2011

Shrubs modify many ecosystem processes including snow depth and associate hydrologic dynamics, nutrient exchange and associated net carbon balance, albedo and associated energy fluxes. At this time, there is considerable uncertainty about the magnitude and direction of these feedbacks and these processes might drive them in various directions. However, dramatic changes to shrub abundance in tundra ecosystems could result in significant alterations to the global carbon cycle. 


Temperature limits the reproduction and growth of shrub species in tundra ecosystems. The low pollen or seed viability in different populations of shrub near their range limits suggest that temperature limitaion of reproduction may determine the northern extent of many shrubs in the low Arctic. However, recruitment seems to increase in recent years in some places. It doesn't necessarily mean that it increases shrubs in tundra.

In some studies, winter temp and snow correlates with growth in the following summer. Snow melt timing determines the length of the GS and snowpack provides protection from frost damage during the winter/spring. This suggests taht warmer ocnditions will promote shrub growth either directly: physiological processes. Indirectly: enhancing soil microbial activities taht supply nutrients for shrub uptake. However, increased summer temp is also linked to moisture deficits in summer which could offset expected growth increase, which has been observed in boreal trees.

Recent research highlights that: (1) growth in shrub species is often strongly correlated with growing season temperatures; (2) disturbances such as fire and permafrost thaw can enhance shrub expansion; (3) herbivory can control shrub canopy architecture and limit expansion rates; (4) shrub canopies can alter surface albedo and increase atmospheric heating; and (5) shrub canopies can trap snow and insulate soils in the winter, yet shade soils and maintain shallower active layer depths during the summer.

### Stable isotopes in tree rings
Danny McCarroll*, Neil J. Loader, 2003
**Permanent notes:**
Chronologies with preserved trees in lakes and buildings, alongside bristlecone pines provide the basis for dendrochronological dating and were used to calibrate the radiocarbon timescale. Cite: Stuiver and Reimer, 1993

The three main elements in wood (carbon, oxygen and hydrogen) all have more than one stable (non-radioactive) isotope. Carbon, for example, has two stable isotopes, 12C and 13C, each with six protons but with either six or seven neutrons. These isotopes have almost identical chemical properties but the difference in mass allows physical, chemical and biological processes to discriminate against one of them, thereby imparting an environmental signal. 

Although the carbon of each annual tree ring has its origin in the CO2 of air, and O and H come from soil water and thus precipitation, the isotopic ratios in wood are very different to those in either air or water, so trees do not passively collect and store these elements. The primary value of the isotopic records in tree rings is not simply as samples of ancient air or water, but as sensitive bioindicators of the way that the components of air and water have been changed by the trees in response to the environments in which they lived.

We know that climate will change, but the question is how it will change in different places. Models can predict this, but we need high resolution and spatially explicit evidence of the way climate changes behaved over space and over time. This info is obtainable from stable isotopes in tree rings. 

###Timing and duration of European larch growing season along altitudinal gradients in the Swiss Alps
2009
**Permanent notes:**
Linking growth processes and changes in environmental conditions are chalenged by a limited nb of replicates and observed years.

Assessing impacts of climate change, info gained along an elevational gradient may be particularly useful because such gradients allow "space-for-time/warming experiments". This approach, long term changes in the timing and duration of tree growth per shift in degree C (=TIME) are substitudted by changes along altitudinal transects (=space)

They showed that cambial is highly responsive to spring temperatures both under artificially manipulation and natural conditions. Temperature seems to be important to set the growth start, but no effect for growth end. However, it seems taht max growth rate and growth cessation seem to be controlled by photoperiod.

### Tree and forest functioning in response to global warming
Henrik Saxe
**Permanent notes:**
Development of reproductive structures in the autumn may be entirely a function of accumulated degree-days, aka thermal time : Sarvas 1974. Thus, they can be vulnerable to damage by early frosts when development continues late in autumn. Trees can afford this risk, balancing  loss of seed in some years against the production of large, well developed seeds in others.

### Arctic amplification causes earlier onset of seasonal tree growth in northeastern Siberia
Alexander V Kirdyanov, 2024
**Permanent notes:**
Artic and subartic are warming extremely fast, which exceeds the global average temperature increase by four times. DEFINE arctic amplification: The Arctic is warming twice to three times as fast as the rest of the planet due to sea ice loss. 
 Boreal forest zone is experiencing shifts in vegetation structure and productivity, northward vegetation expansion, permafrost degradation and greenhouse gas emission from permafrost thawing. 
The dynamics of boreal forest ecosystems withing the northern tree line ecotone, the transition from northen taiga to treeless tundra is largely controlled by GS temperatures. Current warming is believed to be among the main drivers of initiating an expansion of trees into the tundra as well as forest densification within the tundra.

Rapid onset of tree cambial activity after snowmelt and increased temperature is the key adaptation at the beginning of the GS is Siberia Larch. There is a 24 h photoperiod which enables them to complete tree-ring formation within several weeks of the short GS. 

Their results show a shift in tree growth dependance on temperature to earlier dates --> earlier start of the GS. Coincides with temporal changes of 2 climate parameters that affect the timing of GS: snowmelt and temperature preceding and during early GS. Thus, they show that in Siberia, radial growth of larch mainly depends on early summer temperature. 

### Paleorecords reveal biological mechanisms crucial for reliable species range shift projections amid rapid climate change
Victor Van Der Meersch, Isabelle Chuine, 2025
**Permanent notes:**
All model performance decreased as climatic dissimilarity increased. However, this decline was lower for PEMs, which suggests that mechanistic principles may be more reliable than CSDMs in projecting future species distributions under warming conditions. This shows that the biological mechanisms should be included for future and more robust model projections. 

### Effects of Temperature Variations and Urban Heat Island on the Seasonal Development of Woody Plants in the South of Primorsky Krai
A. A. Marchenko, 2024
**Permanent notes**:
Urban heat island (UHI) effect arises when urban areas experience higher temperatures than their rural surrounding. Urban vegetation is ahead of rural vegetation in terms of the timing of spring phenophases.

### Beyond climate change attribution in conservation and ecological research
Camille Parmesan, 2013
**Permanent notes**:
We know the attribution of global warming to greenhouse gases, but we further need to attribute biological events not merely to changing climate, but specifically to anthropogenic climate change (ACC), the component of change that has been driven by increase in GHG. \

Process based models can be developped for few species for which we have both long observational time series and experimental studies. Ecological models rely often on physiological and developmental processes that relate on temp and precip. These models can document causal relationships between observed long-term chganges in a species and regional climatic changes. E.g. causally related northward and upward range shifts of the pine moth to warming winters that enhanced survival and feeding rates.

Def:
‘Detection of change is defined as the process of demonstrating that climate or a system affected by climate has changed in some defined statistical sense, without providing a reason for that change. An identified change is detected in observations if its likelihood of occurrence by chance due to internal variability alone is determined to be small, for example, < 10%’. 
‘Attribution is defined as the process of evaluating the relative contributions of multiple causal factors to a change or event with an assignment of statistical confidence. The process of attribution requires the detection of a change in the observed variable or closely associated variables’.

Biological processes are complex and vulnerable to misinterpretation. E.g. plants growin in regional warming regions did not advance flowering, but it's because the trend was countered by an opposing response to warmer winter temps that delayed spring events. 

Inference can provide high confidence. E.g. of inferential methods: astronomers can infer the presence of invisible celestial objects (e.g. black hole) based on the behaviour of surrounding observational objects. Biological inference of ACC impacts is based on the principle of parsimony, as ACC allows for a parsimouneous explanation of the changes observatioons. 

Global meta-analyses are likely to remain the most reliable, scientifically defensible and robust set of approaches both for detection and long-term change in biodiversity and to determine the extent to which those changes can be attributed to ACC.

### Detection and attribution of anthropogenic climate change impacts
**Permanent notes:**
Cynthia Rosenzweig, 2013
They criticize that CC detection and attribution have focused on the climate itself and they propose a focuse on CC impacts and the issues arising from teh detection and attribution of these impacts.
