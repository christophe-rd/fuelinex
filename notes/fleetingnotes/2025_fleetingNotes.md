### Convergence of leaf‐out towards minimum risk of freezing damage in temperate trees
##### Permanent notes: 
Armando Lenz, Christian Korner, Yann Vitasse, Sabrina Russo. 2016
Leaf-out occurs when the probability to encounter freezing damage approaches zero irrespective of climatic conditions (low vs high elevation) and species (early- and late-flushing species.

In other words, trees leaf out precisely at the beginning of the probabilistically safe period.

Species with a small safety margin against freezing (*define safety margin*) like F. Sylvatica, employ photoperiod co-control of spring phenology. Species with a large safety margin depend more on temperature.\

Species that employ photoperiod co-control of leaf-out (E.g. F. Sylvatica) can leaf-out closer to the period with a high probability of freeing damage than species relying more strongly on temperature controle.

### Effects of Genetic Perturbation on Seasonal Life History Plasticity
##### Permanent notes: 
Amity Wilczek et al. 2009

They showed that A. thaliana ecotypes can't be divided into 2 discrete classes of winter-annual and rapid-cyling genotypes. Rather, most ecotypes may be capable of both life histories but vary in the sensitivity and timing of the rapid transition between them. Natural variation in flowering pathways may have the greatest phenotypic expression and exposure to antural selection in climates that permit late-summer germination.

### European deciduous trees exhibit similar safety margins against damage by spring freeze events along elevational gradients
##### Permanent notes: 
Yann Vitasse, Christian Korner, 2013

A major part of freeing resistance is to maintain membrane fluidity during the freezing process and to tolerate freezing-induced dehydration in the cell plasma.

To do this, plants synthesize dehydrings and antifreeze proteins and reduce the amount of membrane-located carriers and receptors during the pre-hardening stage in late autumn. Next, plants change the ultrastucture of the cytoplasm and increase the proline and polyol concentrations during the early stage of hardening. The final stage of hardening is reached by a repeated exposure to freezing temperatures during dormancy in winter, leading to species-specific freezing rsistance.

In spring, when the leaves emerge, they loose irreversibly their freezing resistance.

By the end of summer, after budset, the freezing resistance begins to increase again in response to shortening photoperiod and decreasing temperature.

Species range limits are driven by a trade-off between growing season length and escape from damaging freezing events.

They show that freezing events across elevations are such a strong selective pressure  that trees delay flushing until they are safe from damage caused by freezing temperatures.

Delays of leaf unfolding are reported and it is such taht the period available to recover from spring frost damage becomes much shorter at high elevations. Thus it would explain why common garden using elevation gradients showed different spring phenology irrespective of actual weather.

Thus, a short GS limits fruit ripening and seed maturation, potentially shaping northern distribution limits.\

In addition to seed maturation, latitudinal tree species distribution has been sugested to be limited by min. metabolic requirements to fulfil life history traits.

Tree species differ in their min. requirement of GSL that enables them to complete their annual life cycle successfully with respect to species-specific life history traits, e.g. seed related traits, wood anatomy,bud formation or leaf traits. Thus, species-specific min. GSL may bee the ultimate range-limiting factor.

### Genomic evidence for West Antarctic Ice Sheet collapse during the Last Interglacial
#### Permanent notes: 
CC is causing rapid changes in Antarctica including Antarctic Ice Sheet mass loss, with global impacts:

1. Uncertainty in sea level rise projections
2. Marine-based West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) lost 160 gigatons of ice mass/year between 1979 and 2017
3.  It will continue to be a major contributor to Global Mean Sea Level (GMSL) rise under all 	CO2 emission scenarios
4. Unclear whether WAIS is vulnerable to rapid ice loss or full collapse as a result of poor understanding of futur changes.
 
  WAIS collapse could raise global sea level to 3.3 to 5 meters

In the Pleistocene, summer temperatures were much hotter and sea level were higher. There is no evidence whether WAIS completely collapsed at any time in the three million years since the Pliocene
WAIS collapsed when global mean surface temperature  (GMST) was 0.5 to 1.5 C than the preindustrial. This suggests that the tipping point of future WAIS collapse is close. This will bring an significant increase in GMSL

###Potential for evolutionary responses to climate change – evidence from tree populations

FLORIAN J. ALBERTO, 2013
#### Permanent notes:
Populations can respond to environmental change through phenotypic plasticity, by moving to a new area corresponding to environmental conditions they are adapted to, by genetically adapting to the new conditions, or by a combinations of these responses.
Local adapation is more common in trees than in some other plant species. Trees are adapted to the current climate and they are thus potentially greatly influenced by the rapid changes in climate.

The long generation times are a challenge in tree research but they also provide adavantages:
1. Adaption to CC depends on phenotypic traits relevant to new environments such as timinign of growth and drought or cold tolerance and we have a low of into on quantittative genetics and population idfferenetiation of trees because of the 250 years of forestry provenance trials.
2. The demographic history since the last glaciual maximum has been reconstructed for a lot of species by combining phylogeographic and palynological approaches (*define this in a new note) with coalescent-based studies of population demogrpahy. Rates of past adaptation to CC can be infered from these studies. 

CC may result in the intro of new pests, e.g. mountain pine beetle or new pathogens, but also losses of current competittos, insects or diseases caused e.g. by phenological shifts between trees and associated pests. 

Pheno shifts with increased temperature : (Menzel & Fabian, 1999; Menzel et al., 2006; Parmesan, 2006)

Cool table describing linear regressions of 1. bud flush and 2. budset along altitudinal and latitudinal gradients. It shows that the 2 pheno traits differ in their patterns. For bud flush, both altitudinal and latitudinal clines showed similar shallow slopes, but the direction of adaptation varied greatly among species. E.g. pop from high altitude Q. petrae flushed late whereas F. Sylvatica flushed early. Reflects tradeoff between max growing season and spring frost. 
Bud set showed steeper slopes for both gradients and in all species more northern or higher altitude populations had earlier bud set. This indicates that differentail selection on bud set is systematically stronger than on bud flush. Bud flush may display higher phenotypic plasticity as temperatures increase. 

Spring a warming climate, spring phenology can likely respond and advance without much genetic change as has already been seen in many species, provided than chilling requirements are met. 

Criticism: commercially less important species are poorly represented in previously established common gardens regarless of having wide or small ranges. Small range species are more vulnerable. 

### Dominant radial and height growth reveal comparable historical variations for common beech in north-eastern France
Jean-Daniel Bontemps, 2010
**Permanent notes:**
The accuracy of radial growth is questioned for investigating past forest productivity changes. 
1. Radial growth of individual trees is sensitive to local competition dynamics driven by natural disturbances or sylviculture in managed ecosystems. These processes are independant of site fertility conditions, radial growth of trees isn't considered a good indicator of stand productivty potential in forestry compared to mean height. Sampling of trees is usually restricted to dominant trees which experience lower competition intensity and belong to a fairly stable population over time. 
2. Radial growth is usually sampled at breast height. During severe climatic events, ring width reduction may be acute at breast height compared to other positions. Such events modify the relationship between ring size and tree volume increment. 

### Observed forest sensitivity to climate implies large changes in 21st century North American forest growth
Noah D. Charney,, 2016
**Permanent notes:**
The degree to which increased atmospheric CO2 will increase future plant growth (i.e. carbon fertilisation) remains an important unresolved effect. Different pathways can be taken to influence growth and tehse effectsa re integfrated within metrics of water-use efficiency (WUE). Increased WUE has been invoked to explain opbservations such as accelerated growth in free-air carbon enrichment experiments,but its role in reducing water-stress is not clear.
### Xylogenesis: Coniferous Trees of Temperate Forests Are ListeningtotheClimateTaleduringtheGrowingSeason But Only Remember the Last Words!
Henri E. Cuny
**Permanent notes:**
Wood formation (xylogenesis) can generate various wood forms in response to developmental or environmental constraints. Wood anatomy can be observed between different phylogenetic groups.
Wood anatomy is known toa dapt to changes in environmental conditions in space or time. Some of the most spectacular variations in wood anatomy occur in a single tree ring. E.g. in confiers, the diameter and wall thickness of the most abundant cells (tracheids) are divided and multipilied by 5 when going from the beginning to the end of a tree ring. Usually well ordered along treee rings and more or less progressive. 

Plant development reslts in changes in signal concentration or in tissue sensitivity through the GS creating the typical tree-ring structure. May be tied to daylength

In contrast, the environmental theory proposes that the within-ring anatomical changes are driven mainly by climatic constraints. 

Cell enlargement is the plant process the most sensitive to water stress. Long lasting belief that decreasing water availability triggers the transition from wide earlywood cells to the narrow latewood cells (Good refs but don't tell if the belief is still accurate). In contrast, wall thickening involves numerous and complex metabolic processes which are considerted the most sensitive to temperature amopn all the physiological processes related to tree carbon balance.

### Growth variations of Common beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) under different climatic and environmental conditions in EuropeÐa dendroecological study
Christoph Dittmar
**Permanent notes:**
Dendrochronological studies on beech. Good description of their methods.
Chronologies are of good quality if they have the following features:
1. High average cross-correlation for ring series derived from trees within the site
2. High mean sensitivity (relative to year to year variability
3. High percentage of common variance of the components represented in the standardiozed stand chronology 
4. 4. Low first-order serial correlation

They recommend dendrochronological investigations with temporal and spatial comparisons to prove environmenetal impacts on forest growth and vitality. 

### Severe drought can delay autumn senescence of silver birch in the current year but advance it in the next year
Inge Dox, Matteo Campioli
**Permanent notes:**
For the Silver birch used in the study (in norway), cambial activation occurred by the end of April and bud burst occured about 2 weeks before cambial reactivation. But another year, it was the opposite. 

Cambium reactivation took place or before budburst depending on the year. This can be because of birch's diffuse-porous character. Likely, not all conduits are fully embolized in birch in winter and it si therefore not necessary for birch to produce new condutis before leaf expansion in spring. (Are all birches diffuse-porous). Another study in Belgium on birches also found that cambium reactivation took place 19 days before budburst.

Cambial reactivation can take place before bud-burst as trees can use carbohydrate reserves from previous year to fuel the new wood growth. 

They showed that severe summer drought induce an advancement of the cessation of wood growth. 

The onset of loss canopy greenesss was delayed by summer drought. It's in contrast with the litterature where one possibility is that leaf mortality occured earlier than the start of their obervations. Can be because trees drought stressed would have triggered a delayed senescence to enhance carbon assimilation. 

They didn't see a lag effect of drought on the cessation of wood growth of the next year.

Difference in tree-ring width can be the result of 4 things:
1. early cambium reactivation in 2018
2. Deficit in carbohydrates of reserves in 2018 negatively affecting wood growth the following year. 
3. Fast-wood production during the spring 
4. Presence of tension wood overestimating the tree-ring width in that year.
