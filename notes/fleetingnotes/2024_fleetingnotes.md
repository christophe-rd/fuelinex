On growing season and senescence. Autumn warming delays senescence dates by up to 8 days/1 degree increase.

Keenan predicted that by each day of advance spring leaf out = uptake of 45kg carbon/ha. Predicited each day deleay in autumn senescent = uptake of 98kg/ha.

Piao found carbon losses in longer growing season.

Delayed leaf senescence doesn’t necessarily translate to elevated plant productivity. Warmer springs and summers can also lead to earlier growth cessation. 

**Ok**

Despite keeping their green colour, leaves reduce photosynthetic capacity after summer solstice. There is also the fact that in autumn, there is declining radiation. 

Plant photosynthesis is not only regulated by environemental cues. It’s also limited by feedbacks between sink (growth) and source activity (photosynthesis). Therefore, autumn productivity appears to be limited by plant’s carbon sink strength (e.g. nutrient limitation). **what if we don’t limit nutrient?

For biomass measurements, they waited until all plants were in full dormancy to prevent respiratory carbon losses

**Pretransplant fertilization of containerized Picea mariana seedlings: calibration and bioassay growth response**

Hardening period: shortly after bud formation, overwintering tissues undergo a long hardening period that is perceived by shorter photoperiod and reinforced by cold temperature as they enter dormancy phase.

Nutrient build-up in seedlings can be high, but the carry-over effect of high fertilization on root-plug nutrient status into the hardening period is short lived, probably because of continued plant uptake and leaching. *** leaching : lessivage

**Concepts in empirical plant ecology**

The assumption that individuals are resource limited is misleading. It’s based on agronomic perception because it’s focused on biomass production, whereas ecological concept of limitation accounts for evolutionary fitness i.e. reproductive performance of a plant relative to its neighbours (conspecific individuals or other species). The term optimum is often ambivalent and doesn’t account for a community. E.g. in a semi-arid community, if there is more water, at first there won’t be new taxa, but after the transition period, new species assemblage and = change in community. 

Definition of stress:

Should not be defined as the absence of optimal growth conditions. If that was the definition, plants in the wild would be permanently stressed. Stress is best applied to situations in which plants experience severe constraints that drastically diminish their reproductive success so that they can become locally extinct.

**Carbon Source Reduction Postpones Autumn Leaf Senescence in a Widespread Deciduous Tree**

They added NPK fertilizer in the form of balls. 2.15g and 0.55g of micro nutrients in 5.5 l pots

The concentration of the soil mixture was N: 54g/m3, Phosphate: 140g/m3 and Potassium400g/m3

**A new process-based model for predicting autumn phenology: How is leaf senescence controlled by photoperiod and temperature coupling?**

They define the vegetation growing season as the leaf unfolding date in spring to the leaf colouration in autumn. These 2 phenomenons can act as a link between climate change and biogeochemical cycles. 

Growing season shifts may influence exchange capacities of carbon, water and energy among land surfaces and atmosphere = ecosystem productivity variations. This will in turn affect the global carbon balance and climate change. 

Changes in autumn leaf phenology in temperate forests can better explain variation in annual net ecosystem productivity (NEP) than spring phenology. Delayed autumn leaf senescence —> increased NEP.

**DONE**

There is a consensus that leaf senescence is controlled by photoperiod and temperature. As days shorten and temperature decreases, an abscission zone starts to form at the base of the petiole and chlorophyll degradation occurs. 

At latitudes where severe winters occurs, it seems like photoperiodic regulation is stronger than temperature whereas winters are less severe, temperature exerts a certain amount of control over autumn phenology. But we don’t know how much is split between photoperiod and temperature for many species. 

Precision: their study was conducted on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. 

Their results show that minimum temperature may trigger leaf-senescence through decreasing light-saturated photosynthetic rate( not sure what that means) and limiting merismetic activity in shoot

Definition of bud set: growth cessation. It’s independent of autumn senescence. Senescence cannot be initiated until a certain time after growth cessation.

**Acclimation of phenology relieves leaf longevity constraints in deciduous forests**

We have reliable models to predict SOC (Start of season) based on accumulated temperature and photoperiod. In contrast, long-term trends in autumn senescence are less clear, depend on end of season (EOS) definitions bases on senescence start, leaf discolouration stages or dormancy, and **drivers are not mwell understood.** 

Experiments showed warm autumns = delayed leaf senescence. However, long-term observations often don’t show an association between phenology and autumn warming. 

One study (cited in the article): found a strong relationship between observed EOS and simulated net carbon assimilation, such that greater productivity was associated with earlier leaf senescence (where does that leave me?). This negative relationship was interpreted as a plant response to C sink saturation whereby an early replenishment of non-structural carbon reserves induces an early cessation of teh photosynthetically active season. 

In that sense, EOS advancement is predicted as SOS is early and plant can saturate their non structural carbon reserves. 

**Phenotypic plasticity of leaves enhances water-stress tolerance and promotes hydraulic conductivity in a tall conifer**

On Segi.

They studied Segi’s anatomy at an elevation gradient. They hypothesized that the structure of foliage within crowns of tall sequoia varies in response to gradients of water/light availability. 

**Asymmetric effects of cooler and warmer winters on beech phenology last beyond spring**

Phenological response to temperature and photoperiod differs a lot among coexisting species. In that sense, climate change will likely affect the competition among species and shift their distribution. 

Spring leaf phenology has advanced by many days. However, warmer climate has a dual role that affects both dormancy release in winter and the initiation of bud development in spring. 

It’s reported that there is now more forcing requirements. That is the result of insufficient chillling requirement for full dormancy release.

Criticism from the authors: most studies focus on a single phenophase and therefore don’t consider the potential effect of one phenophase to the other phenophases occuring within the same growing season. Nor do they consider from one year to the next one i.e. the carryover effect.

**Plant Phenology and global climate change: Current progresses and challenges**

Climate change has greatly shifted major events. E.g. spring and autumn, but also caused phenological mismatch accross trophic levels. This can have strong impacts on community structures and ecosystem functions. E.g. different phenological responses to warming between plants and animals can lead to bird species not breeding at the time when the food isn’t at it’s maximum supply
