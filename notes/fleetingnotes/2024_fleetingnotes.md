On growing season and senescence. Autumn warming delays senescence dates by up to 8 days/1 degree increase.

Keenan predicted that by each day of advance spring leaf out = uptake of 45kg carbon/ha. Predicited each day deleay in autumn senescent = uptake of 98kg/ha.

Piao found carbon losses in longer growing season.

Delayed leaf senescence doesn’t necess

**Ok**

Despite keeping their green colour, leaves reduce photosynthetic capacity after summer solstice. There is also the fact that in autumn, there is declining radiation. 

Plant photosynthesis is not only regulated by environemental cues. It’s also limited by feedbacks between sink (growth) and source activity (photosynthesis). Therefore, autumn productivity appears to be limited by plant’s carbon sink strength (e.g. nutrient limitation). **what if we don’t limit nutrient?

For biomass measurements, they waited until all plants were in full dormancy to prevent respiratory carbon losses

**Pretransplant fertilization of containerized Picea mariana seedlings: calibration and bioassay growth response**

Hardening period: shortly after bud formation, overwintering tissues undergo a long hardening period that is perceived by shorter photoperiod and reinforced by cold temperature as they enter dormancy phase.

Nutrient build-up in seedlings can be high, but the carry-over effect of high fertilization on root-plug nutrient status into the hardening period is short lived, probably because of continued plant uptake and leaching. *** leaching : lessivage

**Concepts in empirical plant ecology**

The assumption that individuals are resource limited is misleading. It’s based on agronomic perception because it’s focused on biomass production, whereas ecological concept of limitation accounts for evolutionary fitness i.e. reproductive performance of a plant relative to its neighbours (conspecific individuals or other species). The term optimum is often ambivalent and doesn’t account for a community. E.g. in a semi-arid community, if there is more water, at first there won’t be new taxa, but after the transition period, new species assemblage and = change in community. 

Definition of stress:

Should not be defined as the absence of optimal growth conditions. If that was the definition, plants in the wild would be permanently stressed. Stress is best applied to situations in which plants experience severe constraints that drastically diminish their reproductive success so that they can become locally extinct.

**A new process-based model for predicting autumn phenology: How is leaf senescence controlled by photoperiod and temperature coupling?**

They define the vegetation growing season as the leaf unfolding date in spring to the leaf colouration in autumn. These 2 phenomenons can act as a link between climate change and biogeochemical cycles. 

Growing season shifts may influence exchange capacities of carbon, water and energy among land surfaces and atmosphere = ecosystem productivity variations. This will in turn affect the global carbon balance and climate change. 

Changes in autumn leaf phenology in temperate forests can better explain variation in annual net ecosystem productivity (NEP) than spring phenology. Delayed autumn leaf senescence —> increased NEP.

**DONE**

There is a consensus that leaf senescence is controlled by photoperiod and temperature. As days shorten and temperature decreases, an abscission zone starts to form at the base of the petiole and chlorophyll degradation occurs. 

At latitudes where severe winters occurs, it seems like photoperiodic regulation is stronger than temperature whereas winters are less severe, temperature exerts a certain amount of control over autumn phenology. But we don’t know how much is split between photoperiod and temperature for many species. 

Precision: their study was conducted on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. 

Their results show that minimum temperature may trigger leaf-senescence through decreasing light-saturated photosynthetic rate( not sure what that means) and limiting merismetic activity in shoot

Definition of bud set: growth cessation. It’s independent of autumn senescence. Senescence cannot be initiated until a certain time after growth cessation.

**Acclimation of phenology relieves leaf longevity constraints in deciduous forests**

We have reliable models to predict SOC (Start of season) based on accumulated temperature and photoperiod. In contrast, long-term trends in autumn senescence are less clear, depend on end of season (EOS) definitions bases on senescence start, leaf discolouration stages or dormancy, and **drivers are not mwell understood.** 

Experiments showed warm autumns = delayed leaf senescence. However, long-term observations often don’t show an association between phenology and autumn warming. 

One study (cited in the article): found a strong relationship between observed EOS and simulated net carbon assimilation, such that greater productivity was associated with earlier leaf senescence (where does that leave me?). This negative relationship was interpreted as a plant response to C sink saturation whereby an early replenishment of non-structural carbon reserves induces an early cessation of teh photosynthetically active season. 

In that sense, EOS advancement is predicted as SOS is early and plant can saturate their non structural carbon reserves. 

**Phenotypic plasticity of leaves enhances water-stress tolerance and promotes hydraulic conductivity in a tall conifer**

On Segi.

They studied Segi’s anatomy at an elevation gradient. They hypothesized that the structure of foliage within crowns of tall sequoia varies in response to gradients of water/light availability. 

**Asymmetric effects of cooler and warmer winters on beech phenology last beyond spring**

Phenological response to temperature and photoperiod differs a lot among coexisting species. In that sense, climate change will likely affect the competition among species and shift their distribution. 

Spring leaf phenology has advanced by many days. However, warmer climate has a dual role that affects both dormancy release in winter and the initiation of bud development in spring. 

It’s reported that there is now more forcing requirements. That is the result of insufficient chillling requirement for full dormancy release.

Criticism from the authors: most studies focus on a single phenophase and therefore don’t consider the potential effect of one phenophase to the other phenophases occuring within the same growing season. Nor do they consider from one year to the next one i.e. the carryover effect.

**Plant Phenology and global climate change: Current progresses and challenges**

Climate change has greatly shifted major events. E.g. spring and autumn, but also caused phenological mismatch across trophic levels. This can have strong impacts on community structures and ecosystem functions. E.g. different phenological responses to warming between plants and animals can lead to bird species not breeding at the time when the food isn’t at it’s maximum supply. E.g. this can also cause teh reduction in seed production for some tree species. 

Changes in phenology that are caused by warming are also a primary cause for the recent increases in vegetation activity and carbon uptake

In the second paragraph of the first section of the methodology, they provide an. example of BBCH. It's a system that has provided a uniform definition of plant development stages. 

On remote sensing: the spatial resolution of satellite data varies from 30 m to several km. Therefore, the retrieval and interpretation of stands with mixed canopies where several species are present and different phenophases co-occur at the same time. 

2.4 Manipulative experiments

Using only phenology observations, it's very difficult to reveal the covarying drivers of phenology and  gain insights in the mechanisms that drive the patterns in the observations and changes. To understand more the mechanisms of plant phenology, manipulatve experiments have been proven to be a very useful tool. 

There are types of climate warming experiments : passive and active warming. Both show similar results: spring leafing is highly sensitive to manipulate warming. 

Downsides of manipulative experiments:

1. Most experiments are conducted for a handful of species adn usually have only lasted a few years. This short term may not suffice to induce adaptive responses or to gain complete understanding of long-term pheno responses of plants to environmental changes. 
   
   That's because other ecological processes may play an increasing role overtime. E.g. nutrient availability and thermal acclimation. 

2. Only conducted on seedlings or saplings and rarely on mature trees. Young and mature trees may show very different responses to the same environemental changes.

3. Phenological responses to experimental and natural conditions may differ a lot. 

They mention that despite these limitations, they have the advantage of keeping certain conditions constant, so they are ideal to answer hypothesis testing.  

Few studies have documented the phenological events in the fall. Evidence tend to point towards a delaying trend in the end date of autumn. Much weeker than in the spring though. 

*Thought: could that weeker trend be caused by the fact than autumn phenological events are not as "clear cut as the spring's?*

##### Drivers and mechanisms:

1. Temperature

Response of phenological events is largely non-linear. In autumn and early spring, cooling has a dual role. 1. chilling activates plant stress responses and stimulates plant endodormancy (first stage of plant dormancy). Then a certain amount of accumulated chilling is required to break endodormancy and lead plants into the second dormant stage (ecodormancy). During that stage, the growth of meristem cells is stimulated and plant cell elongation accelarates under warm temperature that is quantified as growing degree-days.

Spring phenology is more responsive to warming during daytime than to nightime temperature

2. Photoperiod

The increasing night length in autumn induces bud set and leaf senescence when photoperiod is bellow a growth-permitting treshold.

E.g. leaf senescence of mature European aspens is mostly regulated by  photoperiod (happens on the same day every year)

Photoperiod effect on spring phenology is unclear unlike its effect on fall phenology. 

With warming-induced leaf out advancement, reduced photperiod earlier in spring may decrease the temperature sensitivity of spring phenology and thus prevent the plants from leafing out too early = potential spring frost. 

Photoperiod sensitivity of spring phenological events might vary among species/latitudes. 

3. Nutrient and water availability

They can affect plant phenology, but their extend is <temperature and photoperiod. 

Nutrients can affect plant's phenology. E.g. enough nutrient during the GS may enhance the plant's resistance and adaptation to freezing stress, thus postponing autumn leaf senesence. 

Studies found that water availability may play a key role in spring and autumn events. Altough not enough empirical evidence. 

4. Interaction among phenological events

Recent studies found that spring and autumn phenology are positively intercorrelated. Underlying mechanisms might related to leaf traits stuch as leaf longetivity and programmed cell death. The interaction between spring and autumn phenology will likely modify pheno responses to climate change. 

##### Ecosystem and climatic impacts of pheno changes

Climate-induced phenology changes may reshape community structure, because of the diverse range of plant pheno responses to climate change. E.g. a study showed that species growing in a cool climate are more sensitive to warming climate then those in warm regions. Convergence of phenological events accross a temperature gradient could increase gene flow accross lat/long.

Impacts accross trophic levels: alter the interactions between plants and herbivores. 

Plant phenological shifts may alter soil moisture, run-off and precipitation primarily through influencing evapotranspiration.

Plant phenological changes can also produce extra biological forcing on surface temperature by directly modifying surface conductance and albedo (and indirectly modifying cloud formation). Earlier leaf out = larger amount of solar radiation absorption that heats the canopy surface. This mechanism is espacially important for snow-covered boreal regions due to the large contrast between snow albedo adn new-leaf albedo. 

##### Challenges

Currently, phenomodels use phenological records. Underlying mechanistic processes governing phenological events are rarely incorporated into models or only empirically represented via statistical relationships.

Inconsistencies of experimental settings see: chuine et al. 2010 and Hanninen 2016

##### A continental phenologymodel for monitoring vegetation responses to interannual climatic variability

Trees need to fullfill a chilling requirement before warmer temperatures begin to affect spring time growth. 

In woody plants, short days induce dormancy or offset of greeness. The critical daylength varies with latitude.

Dry grasslands are sensitive to temperature, precipitation and soil moisture whereas grasslands in cooler, moister areas are mostly influenced by temperature. 

##### A Review of Vegetation Phenological Metrics Extraction Using Time-Series, Multispectral Satellite Data

**Permanent note: DONE**

Phenostages can be detected by: 

1. Human visual observations : pro:  a lot of data from a long time. Con: they represent only a small localized area and in often limited number. Provide detailed and accurate phenology information that is essential for remote calibration of sensing-based models.

2. Near surface measurements : include imagery acquired from convential visibble wavelength digital cameras  with RGB (Red, green and blue) bands, continuous carbon flux measurements and spectral reflectance sensors with multivand radiometer mounted on tripod, fence post, meteo tower or caried on aeral platform.
   
   1. Pro: provide higher temporal resolution and greater spatial coverage than visual observations . Can be used to analyze site-level pheno variations and mechanisms, train satellite remote sensing based pheno models. Bridge between human and satellite remote
      
      1. Digital cameras use the RGB based vegetation index (VI) to quantify canopy greenness. E.g. Phenocam network
   
   2. Con: usually limited in number and spatial coverage

3. Satellite remote sensing
   
   1. Pros: offer global coverage data. E.g. Lansat characterize the seasonality of vegetation at regional scales. 
   
   2. Cons: landsat imagery applications is limited because many pheno changes occur more rapidly than the 16-day revisit of lanset. Also cloud cover

1.3.1. Dynamics of HIV after initial infection

When a patient is infected by HIV, the number of virions in the bloodstream skyrockets and plummets again = acute phase. It lasts about 100 days. This rise reflects the infection of CD4+ cells and the replication of HIB within the infected host cells. Easy answer is that immune system acts to supress the infection. However, Phillips 96 found that the number of virions declines because most of the CD4+ cells have been infected and thus there are fewer host cells to infect. 

He came to the counterintuitive conclusion that the reduction in virus concentration during the acute infection doesn't reflect the ability of HIV-specific immune response to control the virus replication. What Philipps can say : an immune response is not necessary to explain the observed data. 

It illustres an important principle in modelling: principle of parsimony that states that you should prefer models containing few variables and parameters as possible to describe a system.

Things Philipps model succeded to do: 1. Changed the view of what was possible (in regards to CD4+ cells) 2. Produced testable predictions 3. generated a useful null hypothesis: viral dynamics do not reflect an immune response. 

1.4. Concluding Message

Models can only tell us what is possible. E.g. they can tell us how HIV levels within the body or HIV incidence within a population might change over time. But without data, mathematical models can nevert tell us what happened or what's happening.

##### An earlier start of the thermal growing season enhances tree growth in cold humid areas but not in dry areas

**Permanent note: DONE**

Start of the thermal growing season directly influences plant phenology 
and its advance matches the interannual variability of spring green-up. 
These phenoshifts influence the capacity of the biosphere to take up 
carbon and affect the exchange of energy between the atmosphere and the 
bioshere. We don't know if the shifts in plant phenology would result in
 a negative feedback to warming and a increased carbon uptake or 
alternatively, exhibit additional ecological stress.

In addition to earlier TSOS, peak photosynthesis occurs earlier and 
culminates higher in forests of the extratropical Northern Hemisphere

The carbon residence time in tree stems is much longer than in the 
foliage, making the former a major contributor to the long-term carbon 
sink in forests.

Tree radial growth represents the annual accumulation and fixation of carbohydrates in the stem

In addition to temperature, the length of the growing season determines the available period for developing functional xylem through cell maturation and lignification, especially in cold areas. 

In drier ecosystems, water availability is another important driver of cambial reactivation.

##### Progress towards an interdisciplinary science of plant phenology: building predictions across space, time and species diversity

**Permanent note: YES***

Plant molecular ecology research have focused on phenology where studies
 were conducted to understand how underlying physiological and genetic 
structures that control flowering provide evolutionary insights into how
 local adaptation shapes intraspecific variation

To predict plant phenological responses, we need understanding of 
abiotic versus biotic forces that drive selection on plant phenology. 
This is grounded on the concept of temporal niche i.e. that time is a 
primary axis bby which plant species can partition ressources, from 
nutrients to pollinators. Both abiotic and biotic forces can shape 
selection on plant phenology.

They expect that most species even (those with phenologies shaped 
almost entirely by biotic forces) proximately trigger phenology through 
abiotic cues. E.g. Selection on flowering time for some species might be
 driven to match the timing of specialist pollinators, but 
physiologically, they use environmental cues such as temperature and 
photoperiod to cue flowering.

In temperate biomes, when precipitation is regular throughout the year, 
temperature is expected to be a major driver of phenology especially at 
the start and end of the growing season. However, when climate 
variability is low and competition between plants for soil, light and 
pollinator resources is high, biotic forces should dominate to shape 
selection.

In arid and semi-arid systems, moisture is a critical driver of phenology

In tropical regions, temperature, precipitation and irradiance may 
interact to drive phenology. Though, seperating proximate cues is hard.

Annual species are on average, more sensitive to temperature than 
perennial species and early ontogenic stages (e.g. seedlings) appear to 
be more responsive to temperature than adult stages).  This indicates 
that thre is a big tradeoff between investment/risk where individuals 
with lower investments appear more reponsive to temperature compared 
with individuals with more investment.

High risk, high reward: more responsive organisms are subjected to 
greater risks, but also benefits. They also tend to have increased 
abundance or fitness with warming.

Native species appear to be
 more senstitive to climate which suggests that responsive phenologies 
may be important to invasion success.

Closely related species show that related species are more likely to 
flower at similar times. However, there is mixed support fr phylogenetic
 structure of species response to climate. This means that species 
cannot be considered statistically independant and studies considering 
the timing of pheno events needs to consider their shared evoluttionary 
history and genetic background.

Molecular ecology shows a strong  genetic basis for phenology whether 
it's driven by high phenotypic plasticity in phenology across a species'
 range with little genetic variation or cues, such as photoperiod that 
produce a static timing across years within sites. This is an obstacle 
because it means that pheno data taken from field observations from 
field include mixed signals. E.g. observations at one location of a 
wide-ranging species that triggers flowering predominantely by 
temperature, may not accurately trigger the witing-species variation.

one solution is to use time-series data that allows modeling of plastic 
responses to interannual climate variation. Limitation: assumes that 
cues are not locally adapter across species' ranges and may introduce 
bias based on the local climate sampled.

##### Progress towards an interdisciplinary science of plant phenology: building predictions across space, time and species diversity

**Permanent note: YES**

To build robust models, critical data is needed beyond temperature. Data on soil moisture, humidity, irradiance (diffuse and direct) are necessary for any basic estimates of how phenological cues may vary accross species and latitudes and habitats. However, climate factors are intrinsically linked (cloud cover, radiation, precipatation often covary). This makes them difficult to separate their effects.

To estimate how the intraspecific variation in phenology is controlled by phenotypic plasticity vs genotypic adaptation, we can do controlled studies on cues, if conducted across populations. --> links with cookie project

Common garden studies, where exotic species were planted in Europe have found variations over a month in flowering time across populations taken from latitudinal transects spanning 1200-1800km. 

##### Effects of climate change on alpine plants and their pollinators

**Permanent note: yes**

Alpine plant community are simple and comprised mostly of long-lived perrenial herbaceous plants and have a relatively low plant diversity. Trees are absent, but in some alpine areas, smaller shrub communities have been expanding and subalpine plants have been migrating up to the detriment of smaller shrubs. Therefore, one of the most important consequence of climate change is the reduction of alpine environements in result to the migration of trees and shrubs

The topographically complex (rough and patchy ) landscapes that characterize alpine ecosystems should be both more resistand and resilient to climate change, as they have greater microhabitat diversity compared to flat and homogeneous habitats.

Alpine plant communuties are relatively resistant to alien species invasion. This might be because of seed dispersal constraints, but also because of low temperature (slow growth), and biotic interactions. 

Snow melt also provides a major source of water at the beginning of the growing season. Now, more precipitation falls as rain rather than snow which might cause longer growing season and potentially increased summer drought. The warming of the ground is also a cue for plant growth

Flowering phenology: as snowmelyt dates are advancing, growing seasons are getting longer and flowering phenology is getting earlier. This is a major determinant for small plants in alpine environements as they can't start growing until the snow melts. In subalpine, few species may begin to grow before the snow is gone. 

#### Forest phenology and a warmer climate – growing season extension in relation to climatic provenance

**Permanent note: YES**

High temperature accelarates bud burst, flowering and stem elongation in spring, and thus extend the growing season. Optimal temperatures for metabolism, growth and phenological resposnes are the product of long-term adaptation to local conditions even when imperfectly matched with local climate. 

Global patterns of species distribution indicate that temperature sensitivity influences both the potential and realized niche of plants. However, a lot of factors combine to define range boundaries. Plants have adapted to their local environment so their growth and reproduction are optmized.

###### Methods:

Collection of leaf litter from the ground of each chamber at 5 to 18 days intervals. Separated by species and dried. 

Chlorophyll remaining in individual trees. based on a pre-selected subsample of leaves and supplemented by a random sampling of leaves chosen at intervasl throughout each crown. Fallen leaves were recorded as zero color. For populus, they couldn't make estimates as too much biotic damage. Foliar chlorophyll concentrations were estimated at similar intervals using a portable chlorophyll meter (SPAD-502, Konica Minolta Sensing, Inc., Osaka, Japan), a non-destructive method based on light absorption (optical density difference) at two wavelengths.

Unitless SPAD values were converted to chlorophyll concentrations using a calibration established from a subsample of leaves of each species. 

Warming experiments advanced bud burst in all species and years the experiments were conducted, even in species growing well outside of their native ranges. 

There is little concensus on the environmental cues for leaf colouring and abscission in autumn, partly because the pool of ground observations is much smaller and events are difficult to quantify. Observations of growth cessation, bud set, senescence, abscission adn cold-hardiness represent different aspects of "**autumn syndrome**" mediated through an array of signaling pathways. 

At larger scales, autumn observations may rely on ground or satellite based estimations of color change; absciussion dates may be based on light transmission through the canopy or leaf-litter collections, even through leaf fall can be induced prematurely by extreme temperatures, drought, insects or pathogens and may respond to a single episode of high wind, rain or frost. 

Question: when we monitor leaf senescence, what are we monitoring exactly? Could there be a single hormone treshold that could be a better indicator? 

Photoperiod is often accepted as a trigger of autumn phenology, potential warming at the end of the growing season is often ignored. Yet, inter-annual differents beg an explanation. Autumn temperatures were the primary cue for senescence in 2 Quercus species. Same for Fagus, but photoperiod played a role as well. 

In Populus, senescence was triggered by long nights, lower temperature accelarated chlorophyll degradation. On the other hand, senescence in Malus and Pyrus was induced by low temperature and insensitive to photoperiod. Their results showed delayed phenophases regardless of differences in photoperiod between source and field sites. Delays in leaf absission were more pronounced than delays in chlorophyll loss. 

There is evidence from model simulations and field observations that extended GS can increase productivity in forest ecosystems. E.g. an experience showed that small temperature-driven differences in growing season length had a large cumulative effect on annual C exchange. We indicates the importance of usiong a temperature-driven growing season length especially in spring. Longer growing season=higher productivity

###### Growing season changes in the last century

**Permanent note: YES**

Studies (from that study published in 2006) have used 3 techniques to determine GSL change :

1. Phenology

2. Normalised vegetatioin index (NDVQ) from satellite data

3. Surface air temperature.

Since spring pheno events are closely related to temperature, they can act as proxies for spring temperatures. In autumn, it's not as clear, maybe because temporal changes in the autumn seem to be less pronounced and show more heterogeneous patterns.

They also point out a lower difference in autumn phenology compared to spring phenology

*A lot of very insighful informations about papers reporting phenology*

In the northem Atlantic region, a big portion of the climate variability is attributed to North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) Using leafing dates of trees for 30 years, they showed that the growing season was early by 8 days. It is likely explained by NAO

###### Warming experiments underpredict plant phenological responses to climate change

**Permanent note: YES**

There are two main approaches to predict plant responses to climate change:

1. Observations over time or space to quantify sensitivities to temperature variabilit and change. This includes recent warming. 

2. Experiments that directly warm natural plant communities on a small scale

Warming experiments have been used to extrapolate to future conditions. However, this approach rests on the critical but **little-tested** assumption that plant responses to experimental warming match long-term respones to global warming. Testing this assumption is essential if we want to assess the utility of warming experiments for long-term forecasting and prediction.

The analyses conducted for 36 species common to both study types, the experiments still produced smaller sensititivites. More strikingly, the experiments predicted a delay in flowering and little change in leafind in response to higher temperatures wheras the observations predicted an advance of >4.6 days per C for both leafinf and flowering.

Several artefacts may explain the lower sensitivity in the experimental studies. E.g.: 

- differences in the traits of the species sampled

- correlations between MAT and other envrionemental variables for the observational studies

- differences in the degree of warming

They didn't find aanything that these factors explain the smaller or positive senstitivitiues found in the experiment. 

Warming methods have continually improved, all experimental manipulations unavoidably alter additional environemental factors. E.g.:

- Common passive warming structures-open-top chambers- reduce light, wind and often soil moisture and reduce winter temperatures. 

- Above canopy heaters only achieve warming in periods of low wind. 

They found no evidence of differences in the senstivities between the passive and active designs. Canopy heaters seem to have caused the greatest advances.

There were no effects of habitat, study duration or period of warming each year: the results from studies tha manipulated temperature **only** during the growing season were indistintinguishable from thos that eleaveted temperature year around. That means that there are no difference between the 2. 

Both active and passive experimental designs tend to reduce total irradiance and soil moisture, which can delay plant phenology

The few efforts to examine temperature changes carefully have found that warming chambers can sometimes result in the cooling of plots or can have unintended effects on daily and seasonal temperature regimes. 

To project experimental results, we must first verify that they amtch the changes that are observed in natural systems. 

When sampling the same species, experiments failed to rpedict both the magnitude adn the direction of plant responses to warmin

These huge differences between observed and experimentally estimated temeprature sensitivities indicate that experimental results alone should not be used for parameterizing species distribution and exosystem models.

###### A globally coherent fingerprint of climate change impacts across natural systems

**Permanent note: YES**

An impass of how to assess the consequences of climate change on natural biological systems comes from differences in perspective on what constitutes an "important" factor. Anyone would consider a currently strong driver to be important. But biologists also attach importatn to forces that are **currently weak but are likely to persist**.

Definition of climate fingerprint:

- Economist would conclude that climate change was important if it were principally responsible for a high proportion of current biotic changes.
  
  - By this criterion, a climate fingerprint appears weak
  
  - Most short-term local changes are not caused by climate change but by land-use change and by natural fluctuations in the abunmdance and distribution of species.
  
  - This approach ignores small systematic trends tht may become important in the longer term. But they could be confounded by strong forces such as habitat loss.

For range bounderies, their meta-analysis showed that the range limits of species have moved on average 6.1km/decade. 

For phenology, there was shift towards earlier spring timing of 2.3 days/decade for herbs, shrubs, trees, birds, butterflies and amphibians. 

They assessed phenology for 677 species over a time of 16-132 years. 27% showed no trends in phenology, 9% trend toward delayed spring events and 62% towards spring advancement. 

Increased CO2 can directly cause earlier flowering as does increased temperature, making these effects difficult to separate. *Is that still true?*

Climate and extreme weather events are mechanistically linked to body size, individual fitness and population dynamics for diverse species.

###### Methods of Dendrochronology: Applications in the Environmental Sciences

**Permanent note: YES**

METHODS

At the start of the research project, there is a search phase. At this stage, the optimum information should be obtained with the least effort. The first features of the core that are easy to identify are:

- Mean ring width

- Sensitivity (i.e. frequency of visually recognizable signatures or pointer years)

- Frequency and date of abrupt changesin ring width 

- Rot, wounds, compression wood. 

Definition of dendroecology: determination of teh year-by-year interplay of realtionships among climate, site conditions, and tree growth to assess exogenous and endogenous factors taht influence the growth of a plant community

Once the surface is prepared, it may be cross-dated first or measured first, then cross-dated using the measured ring width.

Simple orbital or rotary sanding tools using a range of grit size from 280 to 600 are satisfactory.  Don't overheat the wood and wear mask as the dust from hardwood is linked with cancer.

###### Declining global warming effects on the phenology of spring leaf unfolding

**Permanent note: YES**

Phenology of spring leaf unfolding influences regional and hemispheric-scale carbon balances, the long-term distribution of tree species, and plant-animal interactions. 

The extent at which leaf unfolding will respond to climate change is uncertain because the underlying mechanisms respond to environmental stimuli are still not well understood. 

There are still debates regarding the linearity of leaf unfolding in response to climate warming. 

They used pheno data from 1245 sites for sevent dominant tree species in Europe using mature trees. 

They showed VERY interesting results. The leaf unfolding decreased in response to climate change. Three hypothesis:

1. Adaptation to increased variance in spring temperature
   
   1. Possible effects of increased variance in temperature. Trees may develop conservative strategies (or higher phenological plasticity) of spring leaf unfolding in places where temperatures fluctuates more. E.g. to avoid spring frost damage. 

2. Photoperiodic limitations (due to earlier leaf unfolding) overrding temperature controls

Early leaf unfolding in warm springs increase the risk of late frost events for trees. To overcome this risk during warm springs, many species have evolved a protective mechanism related to photoperiod. This prevents the warming response when the days are still short and the risk for subsequent frost events is thus high.

Change in the relationship between chilling accumulation and heat requirement due to shortening days as warming advances leaf unfolding. However, they didn't observe changes in leaf unfolding with latitude neither across species nor individual species, as one could experct if photoperiod was a strong co-limitation of leaf unfolding.

They hve no evidence to exclude photoperiod as a controlling mechanism for the decline in spring unfolding as different popultations may have different genetic adaptaions to photoperiod.

In addition, the lack of relationship between spring unfolding and latitude may have been because the response of spring phenology to photoperiod can be associated with a lot of confounding factors:

- Tree age

- Successional niche

- Xylem anatomy

- Chilling conditions.

Therefore, they couldn't conclude that photoperioid did not influence leaf unfolding, but how it might directly or indirectly affect spring phenology still remains unclear and is currently under debate.

3. Reduced duration and/or sum of cold temperatures during dormancy i.e. a lost chilling mechanism.

Boreal and temperate trees require a certain amount of heat after they come out of the rest period to initiate leaf unfolding in spring. Heat requirement is met sooner in warm springs. However, heat requirement is negatively correlated with chilling (accumulation of cold temperatures during the dormancy period. As the dormancy period warming during the study period, the accumulated chilling is progressibely reduced, thereby increasing the heat requirement ans slowing the advance of leaf unfolding.  They tested this by calculating the accumulation of chilling (sum of days when air temp was between 0 and 5). They found a significant decrease in chilling accumulation for all species. 

Effects of changes in spring phenology on global carbon cycling: extension of GS can increase the photosynthetic production of forests by 0.5-1%/day.

###### Ecological responses to recent climate change

**Permanent note:YES**

Long-term phenological data sets for birds, butterflies and wild plants have been collected because of the easiness of species ID. Pheno trends show earlier breeding or first singning of birds, earlier arrival of migrant birdsd, earlier appearance of butterflies, earlier choruses and spawning in amphibvians and earlier shooting and flowering of plants. 

Less pronounced changes for autumn phenology.

In contrast with the climatic factors controlling autumn phenology, climate signal for phenology are well understood: all phenophases correlate with spring temperatures in the preceding months. 

Earlier leaf unfolding  generates a longer growing season, but also increase the risk of damage by a late frost.

Climatic regimes influence species distributions ofen through species-specific physiological trescholds of temperature and precipitation tolereance. These climate envelopes shift toward the poles or higher altitudes.

###### Land surface phenology as indicator of global terrestrial ecosystem dynamics: A systematic review

**Permanent note: YES**

Increase in the length of the growing season favorurs increase in net primary production (NPP) resulting in increase CO2 absorption and potentially contribute to reduction of atmospheric greenhouse gasses. It can also have negative effects. Piao et al. 2008 showed longer and warmer autum phenophases increased respiration thus leading to an increase in the amount of CO2 released to the atmosphere.

Longer growing season may also decreasedn albedo as greater amount of surface vegetation exists, which may lead to increased warming of surface due to incresed solar energy absorption vegetation.

Changes in the biological cycle of plants may alter species itneractions (e.g. plant-pollinator interaction), afecting their ecological relationship -->biodiversity loss. therefore, pheno dynamics are extremely important in understanding behavioural responses of the earth' ecostems in the face of clim change.

Phenological changes may influence processes related to wood growth and could have an effect on the timber industry -->Delpierre et al., 2016; He et al., 2018)

LINKS WITH *A Review of Vegetation Phenological Metrics Extraction Using Time-Series, Multispectral Satellite Data*

**Land surface phenology LSP**, which referes to vegetation phenology derived from satellite data is generally estimated based on **vegetation indices** VI (i.e. a combination of spectral values primarily derived from the red and near-infrared (NIR) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum) or **biophysical variables**

BI or biophysical variables time series can be used to study phenophases and obtain specific phenological metrics :**phenometrics** (Def: ecologically-meaningful metrics based on functional analysis from satellite-derived vegetation indices (or satellite-derived biophysical variables). These include the start of the growing season (SOS), the end of the growing season (EOS) and the length of the growing season, which could be considered as a proxy of timing of phenophases.)

LSP studies since the 1980s showed earlier spring and delayed autumn phenophases as general trends. Athough, these trends were associated mainly to changes in temeprature adn precipitation. Pheno cycle dynamics might be related to other drivers, such as photoperiod, soil moisture or organic carbon content. 

###### Large-scale variations in the vegetation growing season and annual cycle of atmospheric CO2 at high northern latitudes from 1950 to 2011

**Permanent note: YES**

Northern ecosytems have experienced the largest warming rates on the globe. In these regions, phenology controls the seasonal onset adn ending of the carbon uptake period, thereby directly affecting net ecosystem carbon balanece. 

Extension of GS in autumn prolongs photosyntesis in some vegetation types despite decreasing radiation levels. However, the net impacts on seasonal ecosystem balance is not always positive as soil respiration tends to increase more than photosynthesis. 

###### Leaf-out phenology of temperate woody plants: from trees to ecosystems

**Permanent note: YES**

Within temperate plant communities, trees and shrubs vary widely in leaf-out times, both among and within species. It can also vary with individuals in different microhabitats within one population. E.e. sugar masple seedlings growing in the understory will leaf out earlier than adults in the canopy, taking advantage of the light availabillity. 

Photoperiod:

Not all species respond to photoperiod cues and not all populations of a species have the same requirements. 

Populations of a given species often have differing photoperiodic requirements across a latitudinal gradient, which are known as photoperiod ecotypes. Lots of long-lived trees rely on a combination of photoperiod and temperature to break dormancy. 

Many early successional oppotunistic species such as birches, poplars don't have a photoperiod requirement to break dormancy, but do have chilling requirements. 

Differences in stem anatomy could explain why some co-existing species leaf-out at different times. Diffuse porous species,  that produce small vessel elements throughout the growing season, tend to loeaf-out earlier in teh spring e.g. maples, birches, alders and poplars. Their small vessel elements are less susceptible to embolism during the winter, which allows them to begin to meet demands of transpiration earlier in the growing season. 

Ring porous species, such as oaks, ashes and hickories have less uniform vessel elements, producing larger vessels in the spring and smaller ones later in the growing seaon. These will be more susceptible to winter freeze which leads to later leaf-out.  However, there are a lot of exceptions to these rules. 

Another factor that influences the timing of leaf out is the amount of **genetic diversity **of a species. Species with low genetic diversity have far more limited variation in budburst dates across a region than those species with high diversity.

###### Leaf-out phenology of temperate woody plants: from trees to ecosystems

**Permanent note: YES**

Another theory to explain differences in leaf-out timing among species is evolutionary response to herbivory pressures. Study case: 2 co-occuring varieties of English oak (Quercus robur), one variety leafs-out as much as 5 wks earlier than the other, but sufferes more from herbivory damage. That suggests the opportunity cost of losing more than 1 month of photosynthesis is offset by decrease in foliar damage. See Wesolowski & Rowinski, 2008

While a more universal protocol for monitoring leaf-out would be helpful, Parmesan 2007 found that quantification of changes in leaf-out timing have been found to be quite robust across studies despite methodological differences. 

Earlier leaf-out increases the risk of spring frost. e.g. in 2007 Eastern NA, there was warm weather in March=leaf-out. Subsequent freezing temperatures in early April caused the young leaves and flowers of woody plants to sufffer from frost damage. Immediate result: dieback of youg growth. The damage differed among species depending at which individual developement stage. Plants undergoing leaf elongation suffered much more than those that were just budbursting their buds. Species that burst their leaf buds early but develop slowly were less vulnerable to the late frost than plants with early budburst and quick leaf developement. Species with late budburst and quick developement of leaves also suffered high damage. 

Phenology is a heritable trait with high variability withing species and populations. This suggests that plants may be able to undergo genetic changes in response to new conditions over the course of several generations. (Chuine 2010). Leafing phenology is also highly plastic, allowing plants to survive variabilkity in weather conditions. 

Phenology and ecosystem processes. When trees leaf-out, canopy trees alter water and light environments of coexisting organisms. Earlier leaf-out leads to the canoppy interecepting more of the incoming radiation and precipitation. These reduce throughfall, soil weater and soil evaporation. 

It also has strong controls over rates of water uptake by trees. Reduces light and water for plant understory. Can be quite negative. 

Earlier onset of spring did result in increase of carbon sequestered in deciduous forests and to a lesser extent, coniferous forest. 

Cool picture of how vegetative phenology can affect physiological activity. 

Species don't all respond to changing temperature in the same way and there is a wide variation nin leaf-out timing as a result of different control mechanisms. *link this to a previous note above.*

###### Phenology Under Global Warming

**Permanent note: YES**

Christian Körner

Spring events at temperate latittudes have advanced by 2.5 days per decade since 1971 : A. Menzel et al., Glob. Change Biol. 12, 1969 (2006).

The three most important factors controlling phenology in dominant forest tree species are the degree of winter chilling, photoperiod and temperature. A lack of sufficient chilling in mild winters delays bud break. However, it may be partially replaced by long photoperiods and or very high temperatures. 

Not all tree species are sensitive to photoperiodm, but the long-lived, late successional species that become dominant in mature forests commonly are. Shorter lived-early successional species adopt are more risky life strategy. Poplars, birch are usually oppotunistic i.e. photoperiod insensitive in spring. 

Oppotunistic taxa may profit from a warmer climate and may thus gain a competitve advantage over photoperiod-sensitive taxa. 

###### Photoperiod constraints on tree phenology, performance and migration in a warming world

**Permanent note: YES**

Way, Danielle

 Warming will not be distributed equally across the globe. Higher latitude regions will warm more than equatorial regions, with mean annual temperatures in artic regions predicted to warm by 8.3C and summer temperatures in broeal regions by 6C by the highest emission scenario by 2100

Warming experiments show that increased temperature will affect tree growth with direct effects on plant physiology. These effects are positive fro deciduous species and negative for evergreen. 

Longer GS could increase forest productivity or offset reductions in mid-summer carbon uptake caused by increasing heat and drought stress. 

Potential asynchrony between photoperiod and temperature. E.g. as the climate warms at a specific location, the day of year when the risk of spring frost ceases or autumn frost appears will have a shorter photoperiod than it currently does. 

There is considerable evidence that photoperiod is the dominant cue for growth cessation and bud set in many temperate and boreal trees. Temperature has been shown to impact these processess in some species. Bud set represents a major shift in developmental pathways that starts the process of dormancy induction prior to winter. 

Photoperiodic control of growth cessation and bud set comes from provenance trials. E.g. balsam poplar populations have showed important divergence in bud set when grown in a common garden. This suggests strong selection for this phenological trait (neutral processes).

Phenotypic variance in budset is strongly related to provenance, with northen populations setting bud earlier than southern ones, consistent with the role of photoperiod as a major control on bud set. 

Generally, trees from lower altitudes have shorter critical photoperiod to induce growth cessation or budset. Thus, if moved poleward, they set bud later and achieve higher growth than local genotypes. Similarly, when populations are moved toward equator they set bud and cesase growth earlier as they have longer critical photoperiods. 

Cool table about photoperiod sensitivity.

###### Predicting phenology by integrating ecology, evolution and climate science

**Permanent notes: YES**

Pau, Stephanie, Wolkovich, Lizzie, Cleland, Elsa.

Definition of Climate: composite of generally prevailing weather conditions (e.g. temperature and precipitation) at a site or over a region, for some defined period of time (e.g. months, seasons, years)

Holy grail in ecology: unify our understanding of variation across scales, linking genetic studies to the expanseive spatial and temporal scale of natural systems

Growing degree day models are highly asccurate at predicting models typically use daily temperature data to capture chilling requirements and heat accumulation over the course of a season,

Phenology provides a mechanism by which coocurring species can reduce competition by partinioning resources through time - TEMPORAL NICHE. Hence, the community context of phenology becomes important. This is supported by work that showed that a species phenology may be sensitive to local community composition. 

Long as climate been seen as a source of cues underlying phenological events upon which selection acts. E.g. to maximize germination rates, match pollinators, or reduce resource competition. 

Phylogeny may be a powerfuyl approach for understanding phenology because it provides a simple method to integratge species differences across multiple traits, which may have complex underlying physiological pathways. By placing phenology in a historical evolutionary framework, we can predict potential in response to future climate change.

Species are under continuous selective pressure to match their phenologies to favorabl;e environnemental conditions and positive biotic interactions to reduce fitness costs associated with mis-timing. Costs of misstimed phenology associated with abiotic drives should be high. E.g. blooming to early or late can lead to death or extensive tissues loss due to frost or drought in semi-arid systems.

Costs assocaited with biotic drivers may be lower over short-time scales. E.g. species flowers during the growing sweason but at the wrong period, it may face increased com,petition for soil resources or reduced pollination. This may reduce growth or reproductive output. 

They ask a question: How growing season, seasonal transition length, and interannual variability may shape the phenologies of species and communities

Prediction 1:  early season species phenologies should be more sensitive to abiotic forces, wheras mid-growing seasoin specie' phenologies should be governed by biotic forces. As GSL increases towards the tropics, the relative within-season weight of abiotic vs. biotic forces on plant phenology should decrase

![Screenshot 2024-10-28 at 11.02.13 AM.png](/var/folders/7j/k9z66wg973160gwzr455s7n80000gn/T/TemporaryItems/NSIRD_screencaptureui_jtF3Jd/Screenshot%202024-10-28%20at%2011.02.13 AM.png)

Prediction 2: species phenologies occupying long gradual seasonal transition perioids should be sensitive to climate. Species timed to rapid transitions may be less sensitive to climate because of high competition. 

Some systems have extremely rapid, consistent transition periods such as tropical monsoon forests

Prediciton 3: Species phenologies to environements with low interannual variability should respond more strongly to biotic forces, wheras species in environements expericencing high interannual variability should be more sensitive to abiotic forces.

Prediction 4:  Phenological traits responding to cues associated with temporal niche-partioonning, such as photoperiod, should exhibit faster evolutionaryu rates, wheras wresposnes to temperature and precipitation should exhibit slower evoluitionary rates. 

###### Plant Phenology And Distribution In Relation To Recent Climate Change

**Permanent notes:**

Bertin, Robert

Phenology is the most responsive aspect of nature to warming and the simplest to observe (Sparks and Menzel 2002)

Menzel and Fabian (1999) found that 70% of interannual variation in bud break in a group of European species was explained by daily temperature patterns, and average February and March temperatures explained 75% of the variation in flowering time of Japanese cherries

A bias in phenolgical studies is the possibility that studies showing certain patterns of change are more likely to bhe published than those showing no change or change opposite to the expected direction. 

Spring phenophases have advanced much more consistently than summer or autumn phenophases and early spring phenophases show greater advances than those in later spring or early summer. 

###### Responses to a Warming World
Permanent note: YES
Climate change may cause decoupling between plant and bird phenology. E.g. Great tit still breeds at the same time, but its food supply has beenm advanced because of easrlier plant development in recent years. Different phenological responses may alter the competitive ability of different species and thus their ecology and conservation. This would results in unpredictable impacts on community structure and ecosystem functionning. 

###### Shifting plant phenology in response to global change
Permanent note: YES
Elsa E. Cleland, Isabelle Chuine, Annette Menzel, Harold A. Mooney and Mark D. Schwartz

Degree day: nombre of degrees above a particular temperature treshold that can be calculated by many methods and accumulated to provide a sum of (growing) degree days over a period. E.g. with a temperature treshold of 10C, the growing degree days over a three-day period with daily mean temperatures of 19C, 22C and 18 is 9+12+8=29C

Phenoclimatic measures: indices of temperature that integrate over important time periods for plant growth and development; examples include degree days, number of frost-free days, as well as calculations of Spring Indices.

Phenophase: a particular stage of development, such as bud burst, flowering, fruiting, leaf-out, or senescence (equivalent to phenological event’ used in some publications).

Analyses to detect temporal trends in phenbology have traditionally relied on regressions or correlations between observed events adn varaiables, such as year or temperature. These tranditional methods cannot detect abrupt phenological changes tahn can acompany rapid shifts in climate; howeve, new techniques based on change point analyuses and Bayessian techniques enable a quantitative representation of non-linear phenological responses and associated rates of change. 

### 1 November 2024

###### Shifting plant phenology in response to global change

Permanent notes: YES

Most pheno advancing studies have attributed the accelaration of spring events to warming temperatures. Less attention has focused on the role of other co-occuring global changes such as increasing CO2 and shifts in precipiation. 

Crop species respond to elevated CO2 more than wild species for several reproductive traits such as flowring. THis might be because their growth isn't limited by other resources such as nutrients, water and lgiht. 

Temporal dispersion (or complementarity) in phenology is an important factor promoting co-existence among speices in plant communities. It can also influence ecosystem processes such as nutrient capture and productivity. 2 experiments show that species-level shifts in phenology resulted in alterted community interactions.

Accurate phenology predictions would: 

1. Increase accureacey of the predictions of ecosystems productivity and gas exchanges with the atmosphere and thereby the predictions of our future climate

2. Enable a better understanding of population dynamics in multi-species interactions systems 

3. Help farmers and foresters select provenacnecs or varieeties that will be best adapted to the new climatic conditions. 

The evidence for the role in photoperiod on tree phenology is conflicting, depending on species and location. Further experimental work on the impact of the interaction of photoperiod and temperature on leaf unfolding and flowering dates is required so that photoperiod can be used appropriately in phenological models. 

###### Phenological niches and the future of invaded ecosystems with climate change
**PERMANENT NOTES**: YES

There is growing evidence that climate change could facilitate invasions because of the distinct phenology or phenological sensitivity of non-native species. The theory that "windows of invasion oppportunity" may play a critical role in invasions. The concept of temporal niche in which time is a fundamental axis by which species may partition resource use, reduce interspecific competition and thus promote coexistence. Distinct phenologies may result in a competitive advantage for non-native species, especially in areas with shifting growing seasons due to climate change. If native species do not accurately and rapidly tracks shifting claimte, it might produce vacant niches. Such vacant niches may then promote invader success by :

1. Directly i.e. an invader occupies the open niche space

2. Early-season priority effects

3. Invader plasticity where non-native species trackl climatge shifts more closely than native species 

4. Greater niche breadth (width)\

Several studies have found that especially early or late phenologies may aid the success of non-native species. 

Definitions: 

Non-native:refer to any species established outside of its home range; such a distinction between native and non-native is important because non-native species have evolved in a different community than the one into which they have been introduced. Thus, they may exhibit differing strategies and trade-offs than native species.

Invasive:for non-native species with a detrimental impact in their introduced community

Phenology is an important component of plant life history theory affecting both biotic constraints (competition, herbivory, pollination) and abiotic constraints (frost, drought) on plant performance. *important references here*

An important issue is to consider phenology as one trait within a complex network of correlated traits. We need to consider phenology a major trait on which selection acts versus only linked to a more critical trait. E.g. flworing time is often associated with seed size and teaasing out how much phenology or seed size is constrained by the other remains a puzzle, with correlations varying by clade and study.

###### Text Mining in Remotely Sensed Phenology Studies: A Review on Research Development, Main Topics, and Emerging Issues
**Permanent notes:** YES

Remote sensing phenology research is exponentially growing through time, but it is considered a subset of remote sensing sciecne rather than a branch of phenology

###### The interaction between freezing tolerance and phenology in temperate deciduous trees
**Permanent notes:** YES

Trees have evolved, in the last 11 000 years into an interglacial period (Holocene), which is warmer than the preceding 100 000 years i.e. the last glacial period. The holocene is climatically stable when viewed from a geological time perspective. However, the climate of temperate areas is highly variable from the perspective of trees' lifespan, but with a predictable seasonality.  As a result, trees have evolved to cope with the seasonal occurence of freezing temperature. One of the adaptation to seasonality is cold acclimatation in autumn and dormancy in winter, followed by deacclimation period in spring. These are mediated by temperature and photoperiod. 

In deciduous trees growing in temperate climate, the timing of phenological events affects annual growth, reproductive success and competive abilities of trees. 

Changes in phenology may even feed back on climate.

Alongside with shifts in phenology, the risk of trees to encounter freezing damages is changing, but it's unclear wether the risk increases or not. 

In temperate climates, there is four seasons where there are large drops in temperature than can occur from 1 day or 1 week. The contrast in temperature among the sweasons increases with increasing continentality (distance from the coast. 

Warm spells can cause abrupt changs in temperature within a 24h period. They can be associated with severe drought in summers, but they can also lead to a certain degree of dehardening in winter or early spring. Combining with a subsequent freeze can be damaging. Cold spells are potentially damaging in autumn and spring if the tissues aren't hardy enough.

The movement of the polar jet stream is changing with global warming because the polar regions warm faster than the rest of the world. It flows from west to east.

Fagus sylvatica is one of the most sensitive tree species to photoperiod in its spring phenology in Europe. It is also the species that exhibited the lowest variation in its leaf-out timing

When variabiliy in flushing date is discussed, it's crucial to separate spatial (high vs low elevation), from temporal (year to year), and variation wihin a genotype vs different genotype. It's also key to separate tree species that belong to different life histoy strategies (early successional, short lived, r-strategies vs late successional, long lives, k-strategies), trees that grow in the wild versus trees planted in cities/arboreta (provenances or unknown origin) and wild treews in situ vfs cultivated trees or exotic trees.

Dormancy for most temperate tree species is realeased after they have passed through a certain duration of chilling temperastures between 0 and 5C. It interacts with a certain extent to with photoperiod depending on the species. 

Longer duration of chilling and longer photoperiod decrease the thermal time required for budburst i.e. decrease the warmth requirement for budburst.

Dormancy induction is the prerequisite to cold acclimatation during the hardening period. It's widely recognized that the shortening of the photoperiod in combination with lower temperature initate and strengthen cold acclimation. This cause active tissues to gradually enter endordormancy. Cells are a state where they can withstand very cold temperatures.

In spring, there are 2 forms of deacclimatation :

Active deacclimatation : loss of cold hardiness as part of a general enhancement of metabolism and development in response to the combined effect of past chilling experience, photoperiod  and concurrent temperatures. By temperature : forcing. 

Passive deacclimation: freezing tolerance results from the exposure to fully acclimated (hardy) trees in mid winter to small or moderate increases of temperature. 

3 strategies from trees to cope with freezing temperatures: escape, avoidance and tolerance.  

Trees exhibit a high phenological plasticity in spite of clear genetic differentiations related to the climate of origin. The high phenological variation in response to temperature enables temperate trees to adjust their growth period to a larger range of climatic conditions within the distribution range rather than to be localy adapted. E.g. b y adjusting the timing of leaf-out to temperature and photoperiod along elevational gradients, trees avoid the risky period in terms of freezing temperature for sensitive tissues such as new leaves.

Along climatic gradients, a convergence of genetic differentiation among populations has been documented for deciduous temperate trees both for the timing of bud set and bud burst and cold hardiness. Thus, when planted in common grardens, seedling populations of winter deciduous temperate species from high latitude or elevation generally exhibit late spring phenology. **TREE COOKIE PROJECT** --> (Engler, 1913; Burger, 1926; Langlet, 1971; Barnett and Farmer, 1980; Vitasse et al., 2009a, 2013; Alberto et al., 2011; Körner, 2012)

Genetic and phenotypic clines in cold hardiness also exhibit a co-gradient variation: young tree populations from high latitude were found more resistant than southern populations in winter when planted in common gardens. The genetic cline is more marked along latitudinal gradients, because photoperiod controls the gropwth cessation and subsequently the initiation of the acclimation period in most temperate tree species. 

No common garden studies havec investigated whether there is a genetic differentiation among population 

Populations of young trees originating from colder climates has shown slower growth rate. Weak genetic differentiation was found in leaf morphological traits among populations along elevational gradients. This could reflect a trade-off between growth rate and freezing resistance.

For competition for light and water, rapid gain in height seems advanteageous in warmer cliamte whearas cold climate populations are usually more open, and have evolved under natural slection for greaster generasl robustness, includiong cold hardiness. However, the trade-off between growth allocation and physiological adaptations to cold conditions isn't clear. Indeeed, the lower biomass increment found in populations originating from colder environement when planted inc ommon gardens could result from the fact that these populations ceased to grow at shorter photoperiod. 

Deacclimation in late winter and early spring proceeds much faster than acclimation in autumn which makes the trees vulnerable when a wearm spell is followed by a cold spell in nalte winter/spring. 

John Muir described the phenology of pines in Yosemite Valley.

###### The phenology of plant invasions: a community ecology perspective

Ecologists use time to describe the suite of critical but limited resource available to a species at any given time. Variabiliy in space and time may promote coexistence. E.g. Ant species with highly similar diets may coexist because they tend to search for food at different times of the day. At a longer time scale, the storage effect m,odel uses a temporal niche to promote coexistence via interannual variation that benefits different "long-lived" species ind different years. Under this model, a species can coexist with other species when it experiences high-abundance years during which intraspecific competition is stronger than interspecif ccompetition. 

Vacant niche: predicts that exotic plants will invade communities where there is an open niche, often resulting from unused soil resources. For plants, this theory has been modified to include fluctuating resources; in such cases, a vacant niche can be temporally variable occureing only for short time period, but still highly beneficial to exotic species. If an exotic plant species benefits from a temporally vacant (phenological) niche, it wwould tend to bloom and or leaf earlier or later as compared with native plant species, thereby using temporally availab le resources (e.g. sunlight, pollinators, nutrients.)

###### Why Would Plant Species Become Extinct Locally If Growing Conditions Improve?

2 models to evaluate the influence of climate change on species range : statistical climate envelope models and process-based dynamic vegetation models.

Many dynamic forest succession models assume taht the maximum growth rate is attained at the core of the geographic distribution of a species and decreases toward its limits. That's the consequence of using a parabolic relationship between growth rate and thermal time (accumulation of days eceediong a temperature threshold aka Growing Degree Days (GDD))

###### Growth of a Pine Tree
**Permanent note:** YES

Young pine trees are in a rapid growth phase, so the annual rings are wide and easy  measure. Cross sections from wild trees usually are not symmetric because they have been subjected to asymmetric environmental factors such as slope, crowding or uneven light availability.

In the spring, the cambium produces early wood, with large cells and thin cell walls. As the season progresses, the cambium produces latewood

Early wood caracteristics: 

- Large cells

- Thin cell walls

- Light colour

Late wood caracteristics

- Smaller cells

- Thicker cell walls

- Darker colour

The arbrupt transition to earlywood in the spring produces the sharp contrast that makes the growth ring visible 

###### Methods of dendrochronology
**Permanent note:** YES

Sample preparation: 

Cores describe the mounting of increment cores in wooden supports (Stokes and Smiley 1968). Cores should be fixed to the mount using a water-soluble glue so that they can be realigned if necessary. 

Cutting the cores at a 35 degrees to the long axis was the best resolution of surface detail. 

Using a sharp tungsten carbide-tipped circular saw to cut the sample before sanding saves a lot of time. They leave a surface that requires minimal sanding. 

Radiodensitometry: the density of faily larget wood smaples may be determined through volumetric gravimetric methods i.e. weighing and volume measurements, and is then termed gravimetric density.

Surface enhancements: Douglass describes the use of kerosene as a wetting agent to enhance the clarity of rings particulary on a saw cut surface. 

Parker and al. 1976 describes ring wenhancement using zinc oxide which has the advantage of being easily removable usign dilute acid. 

Using chalf to fill the spring wood vessels to make them clearer can be done. Regular black board chalk is good. Suitable for both ring-porous and diffuse porous species.

###### Responses to subtropical climate in radial growth and wood density of Chinese fir provenances, southern China
**Permanent note:** YES

Hong Wang

Ring widths, including tree ring width (TRW), early wood width (EWW) and late wood width (LWW) were measured for each year with a resolution of 0.01mm. 

They also measured density measurements via high frequency densitometry. The ring width and wood density measurements of the disks were carried out from pith to bark.

Cross dating and quality checking were conducted with the COFECHA software for each tree-ring series. They used ARSTAN to standardize the tree-ring series for each provenance. The effects of biological age were removed by fitting a negative exponential function of the Hugershoff method (Hu et al. 2001)

Statistic analysis: to ascertain to explore the trend of geographical variation in different tree ring indices (tree ring width and wood density) for different chinese fir provenances, they used a simple regressioin equations that were developed with the longitude and latitude as the independendant variable and raw mean series for each Chinese fir provenacnes as the dependant variable. 

Since tree growth can be affected by the current and previous year's climatic conditions, they evaluated 16 months of temperature and precipitation data, starting with June of the previous year to September of the current year. 

###### Fundamentals of Tree-ring Research
**Permanent note:** YES

Tree rings are composed of individual cells that consittute the building blocks of the organism of the tree. A basic understanding of tree physiology is also important for comprehending the biologiocal preocesses that link the environment to ring formation. 

Gymnosperms have less-developped and fewer cell types. They transport water from the roots to the leaves through tracheids (long narrow cells that comprise growth rings) in the outer living part of the xylem in the area of the sapwood

Angiospersm transport water and nutrients from the soil to the leaves in specialized, capillary like cells called vessels. They are larger in diameter than tracheids and transport water more efficiently but are more prone to embolism (air bubble formation during conduction that blocks water movement)

Most gymnosperms and dicots in seasonal climates produce one ring/year which are divided in earlywood and latewood. 

Earlywood is defined as cells that have large lumen (the opening in the center of the cell) relative to the cell walls. Latewood cells are always flattened and have a more compact lumen relative to the cell walls and consequently appear darker.

**Secondary meristem** is produced in most gymnosperms and dicots and enables a tree to grow in circumference through time and produce tree rings.

Cell division occurs in the vascular cambium which is a narrow layer of mestematic cells between bark and wood. During cell division, **xylem** is produced toward the inside of the tree, becoming the wood structure that supports the tree, and** phloem** is produced towards the outside of the tree and becomes the inner bark. A **cork cambium** forms the outer bark of most trees.

Less frequently, a series of thin-walled **ray cells** are also produced during cell division in the cambium resulting in a radial cell component that connects the outside of the tree to the inside.

Heartwood forms in the middle of the stems as a result of an active production of substances, mainly phenols, which are deposited to close down teh structure and guaranteee that the wood is resistant to decay. The lighter coloured outer wood is called **sapwood**

The **pith** is the bundle of cells produced by the upward growth of the apical meristem, allowing trees to reach greater heights and creating the cambium initials that start the secondary thickening of trees. Hitting the pit when coring a tree provides the exact age of the tree. 

A cross-section view allows a clear view of the **tracheids** in conifers, which are elongated tube-like cells that make up the majority of the wood and function to transport fluids and nutrients vertically in the xylem of the tree. 

Angiosperms have more complex wood structure than gymnosperms. Fibers provide the key structure and support for the tree, but they also produce vessels taht are used for the main water transport in the tree. They may have the following structures that are apparent in a cross section:

Large and small vessels

Fibers

Tracheids 

Parenchyma cells: more common in hardwoods and actually form the ring boundary in some genera of diffuse porous species

###### A new process-based model for predicting autumn phenology: How is leaf senescence controlled by photoperiod and temperature coupling?

**Permanent note**: YES

Piao, Shilong,  Lang, Weiguang, Lang

Since the vegetation growing season is approximately equivalent to the photosynthetic period, carbon-uptake period, and trasnpiration periood, climate change induced vegetation growing season shifts may influence the exchange capacties of carbon,  water, and energy amon land surface and the atmosphere and consequently result in ecosystem productivity variations. Additionaly, the exchange capactieies of carbon, water and energy will affect carbon balance and climate change. 

They believe that spring phenology model has reached maturity. Since numerous models have been developped to simulate and predict budburst, green-up, leafind and flowering dates. (*they provide an exhaustive list of references for these*)

In contrast, process-based models on autumn plant phenology are still scarce. The main reasons for this are inadequate ground observation data and unclear environemental cues for autumn phenology. 

Autumn leaf phenology in temperate forests better explains variation in annual net ecosystem productivity (NEP) than do chances in spring phenology according to statistical studies. Thus, delayed leaf senescece is associated with increased NEP, meaning that ecosystems tend to sequested more carbon in warmer years with later autumn phenology.

Physiology: leaf senescence is controlled by photoperiod and temperature. As photoperiod shortens and temperature decreases in late autumn, an abscission zone starst to forma t the base of the periole and chlorophyll degradation occurs. 

There would be a strong photoperiodic regulation of leaf senescence at latitudes with severe winters. At lower latitudes where inters are elss severe temperature exerts a certain amount of control on autumn phenology. 

Delpierre suggested a cold-degree day sum. (CDD) model which assusmes that leaf coloration is solely determined by linear accumulation of daily mean temperature lower than a treshold, but its accuracy hasn't been tested. He revised his model by suggesting that leaf colouration is driven both by photoperiod and low tempes. The DM model suggests a photoperiod-sensistive cold-degree day summation procedure. In this model, it's only when both the photoperiod and temperature reach their respective tresholds that leaf senescence process can start. 

Their results show that elasf senescence processes were mainly triggered by photoperiod shortening at locations with shorter annual maximum photoperiod, but by night temperature decrease at locations with longer annual maximum photoperiod. This supports the fact that there are two distinctive growth cessation pathways for woody plants:

1. Low night temperature-induced growth cessation under long photoperiods

2. Short photoperiod-induced growth cesssation under warm night temperatures.

Both pathways reflect plant selective responsed to environmental cues for minimizing risk from abiotic stresses.

Growth cessation i.e. budset and atumn senescecen are two indepednant stages, senescence could not be initiated until a certain time after growth cessation. (*questions: does growth really stops at budset? what about radial growth?*)

Daily minimum temperature (by model TPM) would be important for leaf senescence rather than mean daily temperature. Based on the evidence that minimum temperature may trigger leaf senescence through decreasing light saturated photosynthetic rate and limiting meristematic activity in shoot. As leaf senescence should be intimately related to the previous developmental stages of leaf, such as leaf initiation, growth and maturation, genese could controll these processes including meristematc activity which could influence age-dependant senescence.

Their new model (Low Temperature and Photoperiod Multiplicative Model (TPM)) shows that leaf senescence rate exponentially increases with decrease of arithmetic product of daily minimum temperature and photoperiod.

###### Acclimation of phenology relieves leaf longevity constraints in deciduous forests

Marqués, Laura; Stocker, Benjamin

**Permanent notes**: YES

A positivie correlation between SOS and EOS dates ahve been found in observational ad experimental studies, which could provide useful information for improving EOS predictions.  

A strong relationship between observed EOS and simulated Anet (Net CO2 assimilation), such that greater productivity was associated with earlier leaf senescence. This negative relationship between growing-season total net CO2 assimilation and EOS was interpreted as an expression of plant C sink saturation, whhereby an early replenishment of non-strucvtural carbon reserves induces an early cessation of the photosynthetically active season.

Thus, an EOS advancement was predicted as a consequence of accelarated C sink saturation due to continued SOS advances and enhanced photosynthesis under rising CO2 levels. However, an advance of SOS and a CO2 driven increase in photosynthesis did not lead to a corresponding advance in EOS. 

They show that the relationship between net CO2 assimilation and EOS are opposite at the interannual and the decadal time scales. A trend towards later EOS in parralel with a trend towards increasing net CO2 assimilation in spite of the negativfe Anet-EOS relationship

Their results suggest that acclimation of phenology has enabled plants to trasnscend a constrained leaf longetivity or premature C sink saturation over the course of seveal decadeds, leading to a more ffective use of available light and a sustained extension of the vegetationCO2 uptakle season over time.

###### Alteration of the phenology of leaf senescence and fall in winter deciduous species by climate change: effects on nutrient proficiency

Estiarte, Marc

**Permanent notes**: YES

The purpose of leaf senescence is the recovery of nutrients before the leaves fall. 

Woody plants in temperate and boreal ecosystems have adapted to the unfavorable season of winter by managing their foliage differentyly during dormancy: evergreeen species maintain their leaves whereas deciduous species shed all foliage.

The date of leaf colouring is used to quantify the phenology and leaf senescence. Leaf senescence and change in colour are commonly sinonymous in the literature. Leaf fall is the next step after leaf senescence and in most cases is tightly realted to it to such an extent that it can be used as a proxy of leaf senescnce, assuming a certain delay in time.

Consequences of longer seasons at the indivual level

- Improve competitive ability if C uptake is not compromised by the potential damage of frosts. 

- Advancing leaf unfolding increases the risk of late-spring frosts taht could kill new tissues affect production. 

- Delayed leaf senescence could kill leaves before the completion of nutrient resorption during senescence and could reduce the nutrient reserves taht support growth in the next season.

Leaf senescence consists of the orderly degradation of the cells of the leaf, leading to cell death and utltimately to leaf fall. Nutrient resorption is not absolute and falling leaves retain a certain amount of nutrients, whose concentrations represent the proficiency of nutrient resorption. The proportion of the nutrients in green leasves prior to senescence that are resorbed before abscission is knowe as the nutrient-resorption efficiency.

Leaf senescence implies a radical change in foliar metabolism that shifts from assimilation tot the removilization of resources, as shown by the dynamics of the transcriptoms, proteomes and metabolomes of foliar cells. The onset of leaf senescence, the tipping point in the transition from anabolims to catabolism manifests before teh mentioned external signals are visible. The onset begins with the down-regulation of genes associated with phtoosynthesis and with the up-regulatioon of genes associated with senescence.

By the end of of the process of leaf senescence, a large fraction of the mobile nutrients ahve been trasnferred to the perennating organs. Leaf senescence proceeds sequentially, it begins with the disasssembly of the chloroplast, while mitochondria and nuclei remain functional. 

The degradation of chlorophyll, the cause of the characteristic leaf yellowing, occurs early to prevent the formation of oxygen radiacals that could disturb the activity of enzymes.

Mitochondria maintain integrity until the last stages of senescence, with respiration supplying the aTP and C skeletons needed for nutrient resorption.

The main nutrients withdrawn from senescent leavfes are N, P, K and S, the macronutrients that are mobile in the phloem, whereas Ca and Mg, the other two macronutrients, are less mobile and are often accreted rather than resorbed at the end of the process. 

Proteins are abundant N-containing macromolecules Chloroplasts contain 50-60% of the N in leaves, half of which is in Rubisco. Nucleic acids contain 10-15% of the foliar and minor amounts are found in cytosolic proteins, chlorophyll and amino acids. Up to 9% of the foliar N is in proteins attached to cell walls. S is found in the amino acids cysteine and methionine and teherefore has the same distribution as N in proteins.

Nutrient-containing macromolecules are degraded and transformed into molecules suitable for transport from the leaf. 

Nutrient-resorption efficiencies in woody deciduous plants average 64% for N, 65% for P and 70% for K.

During the dormant season, woody tissues of deciduous plants, but especially 1-year old twigs, store N mainly as storage proteins in the bark, but also as amino acids. When the active season resumes, N flows toward newly formed tissues. Large amounts of N got to Rubisco in the leaves. Rubisco is a protein that has a key role in C fixation, but acts also as storage. When the active season ends, leaf senescence remobilizes a large proporton of the N back to the woody tissues.

The internal cycling of N improves resource economy because it saves plants from devoting resources and energy to acquire new N. This cycling is strategic also because it allows intense growth at the beginning of the season. The flush in the spring is at the beginning almost entirely supported by N stored in the plant. Stored N enables early spring growth independant of potentially unfavorable soil temperatures, although newly acquired can later be supplemented for newer growth.

Getting ready for overwintering:

Step 1: cessation of growth in the middle of the active season in species with free growth for avoiding the presence of active tissues (inadequate for ovewintering.)

Step 2: bud set which protect meristems with bud scales.

These are morphological changes, but biochemical changes also occur at the cellualr level, such as starach catabolism for supplying C skeletons for the synthesis of cryoprotectants or the accumulation of bark storage proteins. At this stage, plants have acquired endodormancy and do not respond to signals that promote growth. 

Step 3: leaf senescence which occurs near the end of this succession of events leading to the dormant stage, but later cellular changes can still occur to further increase frost hardiness.

Preparation for winter dormanyc are mostly triggered by photoperiod. Moving plants to shorter days elicits growth cessation and bud set.

Metabolism generally increases with temperature, bud senescence is usally slower and longer with warmer conditions. E.g. high temperature was asssumed to slow senescence in the leaves of teh upper crown exposed to the sun compared to the upper crown exposed to the sun compared to the sahed leaves of the lower crown. Colder temperatures may also account for the trend toward the faster progression of leaf senescence at higher latitudes. 

Projections that climatic warming will delay the onset of leaf senescence and fall in many regions and species cannot be generalized. The magnitude of the delay will depend on the degree of photoperiodic control for particular species. Members of the Rosacea family will experience the largest effect, and species and poulations suffering severe winter conditions being unresponsive to warming

Determinants of realized nutrient. resorption:

1. Plant physiologicalk status that depends on fertilization or radiation i.e. availablke energy, nutrient concentration, enzymatic activity

2. Existence of a sink demand for nutrients

3. Disturbances

4. Water strees during leaf senescence 

5. Timing of leaf senescence

Leaves that fell early contained more nutrients and the nutrient concentrations decreased linearly with time to match the lower concentrations in the leaves that fell later.

Nutrient resorption takes time. E.g. P. tremula takes two weeks. They hypothesize that with warming, a slower, thus longer leaf senescence can allow a more thorough scouring of nutrients so the realized resorption can approach the potential resorption. 

Species whose leaf senescence will be delayed by warming will confront higher risks of occasional reductions in nutrient profiency, because warming increases the risk that early frosts will kill the elaves before they complete or even begin senescence.

###### Asymmetric effects of cooler and warmer winters on beech phenology last beyond spring

**Permanent note: ** YES

Warmer temperature recorded during the last two decades has resulted in an increase in forcing requirement for budburst of temperate trees in Europe, which is likely the result of insufficient chilling requirement for a full dormancy release or an increasing photoperiodic limitation. 

Most studies focus on a single phenophase and therefore do not consider any potential effect of one phenophase to the other phenophases occuring within the same growing season or event from 1 year to the next one: carry over effect. 

The different phenophases are not independant of each other. \

Campoli et al. 2014 found a carryover effect of spring over autumn phenology or even to the next year spring phenology.

Methods: dormant bud: (0), 

swollen bud (1), 

budburst (2), 

leaves folded in a single plan (3),

at least one leaf fully unfolded (4), 

as commonly used for deciduous trees (e.g., Vitasse, Lenz, Hoch, & Korner, 2014).

he observations were conducted on the apical bud of each sapling in each site by the same observer three times a week from March 24, 2014, until all saplings reached the stage 4.

In summer/autumn 2014, while all transplanted saplings were back in their site of origin, we monitored budset on the shoot apical meristem three times a week using four different stages: ongoing leaf development (0), newly formed green and soft bud (1), small and brown bud (2), elongated (>1 cm), and brown bud (3). Budset timing was defined when a given sapling reached the stage 3, which was taken as a proxy for the cessation of the primary growth.

Leaf coloration and leaf fall were also monitored, but we chose to use only budset data in this study as a proxy for growth cessation. The growing season length for each sapling was defined as the time in days between budburst and budset.

Growth and bud morphology

For each sapling, we measured the stem apical diameter (mm), the stem basal diameter at 3 cm from the ground (mm), and the stem length (cm).

Good formulas of calculation for stem volume

**Nonstructural Carbohydrate (NSC) analysis**

Even though sapling phenology doesn't represent adult tree's phenology, they are relevant as they are the future of the next generation in mature forests. Thus the carryover effect for these might not be as strong as for adults becasue they have other factors such as flowering and seed formation that may play a regulating role. 

They found that the induced delay or advance of budburst had a strong impact on the timing of budset, used here as a proxy for primary growth cessation. 

They suggest taht the potential delay in senescence processes due to global warming might be smaller than expected becaue of this positive relationship between spring budburst timin adn atumn phenophases. 

###### Atmospheric brightening counteracts warming-induced delays in autumn phenology of temperate trees in Europe

**Permanent note:** YES

Recent models predict that in spite of the ongoing warmer autumn trends, leaf senescence might slightly advance rather than delay over the rest of the century. 

In recent years, there has been a reduction in atmospheric pollution and cloud cover that led to significant atmospheric brightening in several regions, with the increased radiation, likely affecting the physiological processes of plants. E.g. increased productivity in Amazon rain forest largely driven by increased solar radiation. 

Increased vegetation growth during the growing season advanced autumn phenology. This can be explained by the carbon sink limitation hypothesis. Check this hypothesis and link it to the carbon sink notes. This suggests that solar radiation might affect autumn phenology through regulating plant productivity

Results presentations:


They reveal an antagonistic effect of warming and bruiightening on leaf senescence for the dominant tree species in central Europe. Brithening accelerates the leaf senescence process and reduces the temperature sensitivity of leaf senescence, couteracting the expected warming induced delays in leaf senescence. The photoprotection and sink limitation hypothesis provide plausible explanations for the negative effect of radiation on leaf senescence and declining effect of temperature sensitivity of leaf senescence in response to brightening,

###### Carbon Source Reduction Postpones Autumn Leaf Senescence in a Widespread Deciduous Tree

**Permanent note: ** YES

While temperature has been shown to be an important driver of autumn leaf senescence, carbon source–sink dynamics have been proposed as a mechanism that could help explain variation of this important process. According to the carbon sink limitation hypothesis, senescence is regulated by the interplay between plant carbon source and sink dynamics, so that senescence occurs later upon low carbon inputs (source) and earlier upon low carbon demand (sink).

Over the past decades, established forests have take up over 25% of the carbon emitted by fossil fuel combustion and land use change. Plant is a major determinant of the inter-annual and seasonal variability in carbon assimilation of temperate and boreal forests.

Autumn senescence thought to be driven by temperature and photoperiod, but factors suche as nutrients, water statuses, pathogen infections and air pollution come into play. 

The concept of carbon sink limitation in trees is supported by a study that demonstrated that individuals that leafed out and senesced earlier had high levels of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC)

A lot of evidence indicate that  the timing of leaf senescence is affected by the balance between the plant carbon source and sink.

If the carbon sink exhaustion proves to be a driver of autumn phenology in temperate and boreal forests, this suggests that ESM projections are oversestimating the positive effect of higher temperatures, nutrient depositioin or CO2 fertilication on plant carbon assimilation under global change. 

To test carbon sink: remove mature leaves or elevation of CO2 levels increase the potential for carbon uptake. The carbon sink can also be increased by ferlization or decrease by the rpevention of pollination --> inhitis investment in reproduction. 

According to the carbon sinkl limitation hypothesis, we expect that all measures decreasing the source, or increasing the sink will postpone autumn senescence.

The removal of leafs increased autumn photosynthesis and delayed whole-plant leaf senescence. This supports the carbon sink limitation hypothesis as it suggests that smaller carbon inputs upon a constant sink size delays autumn senescence and the decline in photosynthesis+

###### Chilled to be forced: the best dose to wake up buds from winter dormancy

**Permanent note:** YES

A lack of chilling does not only affect the time of budburst but could potentially impact tree vitality by decreassing bud survival. With continuing climate change and the winters get warmer, a lack of chilling might lower the sensitivity of trees to spring warming due to insufficient release of dormancy

Chillin duration outweighed the importance of absolute chillin temperatures. This indicates that phenological models of temperate and boreal forests should accoun t for all chilling temperatures below 10C, especially the ones below or above zero.

###### Changes in autumn senescence in northern hemisphere deciduous trees: a meta-analysis of autumn phenology studies

**Permanent note:** YES

Meta analysis of autumn phenology

October temperatures were the strongest predictors of senescence date, followed by cooling degree-days, latitude, photoperiod and monthly precipitation. The strength of the relationships differed between high and low latitude sites. 

Autumn senescence has been more delayed at low (25 to 49N) than high (50 to 70) latitudes. Because high latitudes sites are more sensitive to photoperiod *to cross reference to the notes about this subject.*

Senescence delays in North America>Asia and Europe.

Leaf senescence completes the growing season for deciduous trees and factors tha lengthen the period of plant photosynthesis and increase rates of growth primary productivity could contribute to reduced atmospheric CO2 concentrations to enhanced carbon sequestration in terrestrial plants. 

In addition to site-level meteorological factors, the timing of spring leaf-out would be linked to autumn leaf senescence.

List of metrics used to measure leaf senescence. The one that was the most popular: 50% of leaf fall, 100% leaf fall, NDVI (Normalized difference vegetation index), 80% leaf fall, 50% green, 50% colour change, 0% green, 50% YELLOW. 

Compared to low-latitude ecosystems, high latitude will get the largest increases in temperature over the next century. Photoperiod will remain the same. These asynchronous changes in meteorological factors may affect plant communities and their role in carbon sequestration. E.g. southerly species migrate north in response to higher temperature, these will lengthen their photosynthetic period while native, photoperiod-dependant northerly species may show less flexibility in the timing of leaf senescence, affecting competitive dynamics within plant communities. *Photoperiod constraints on leaf senescence, as it was part of the highly cited papers*

We need to consider the biological releveance of senescence metrics because there can be species-specific relationships between the end of the photosynthetic period and date of leaf fall. Thus, leaf senescence is a combination of biodegradation and nutrient resorption, deciduous trees show a large decline in photosynthetic activity long before they drop their leaves. 

Plants in the orders of Fagales and Rosales respond the most to increases of air temperatures. (oak, birch, beech, carya)

###### Contrasting responses of autumn-leaf senescence to daytime and night-time warming

**Permanent note:** YES

Their models shows that incorporating day time and night time, rather than temperature alone is really important. They predict an earlier LSD unlike what has been reported. It could be an unrecognized positive feedback to climate change and could potentially weakends the capapability of terrestrial ecosystems to uptake carbon. 

###### Delayed autumn phenology in the Northern Hemisphere is related to change in both climate and spring phenology

**Permanent notes:** YES

Studies have reported positive correlations between day length and/or light intensity and EOS dates. However, the physiological mechanism of light regulatioin of EOS is still unclear due to the difficulty in separating the effects of day length and light intensity.

They found that a warming climate in summer/autumn delayed EOS date in most of Northern hemisphere, especially in cold region. This positive effect is likely related to the warming-induced enhancement of activities of photosynthetic enzymes, to the reduced speed of chlorophyll degradation, to the reduced probability of bering exposed to frost in autumn, or to the increased potential for growth and photosynthetic consumption. 

Mechanims proposed to explain the carryover effects of SOS on EOS (i.e. earlier start of season is followed by an earlier date of EOS):

1: Timing of leaf senescence was reported to be constrained by factors associated with leaf traits directly, such as leaf life span and programmed cell death.

2: earlier spring might lead to soil water loss in the early part of growing season, thereby increasing the prevalence of dought during summer --> result in early leaf senescence

3: Earlier leaf emergence may increase the risk of being exposed to spring frost and the oubreak of harmful insects which may be related to earlier leaf sencesnce.

4: Correlation between SOS and EOS may be related to the limitation in the size of the plants' carbon sink: earlier accumulation of nonstructural carbohydrate in spring might have contributed to the earlier achievement of its max carbon content in autumn

However, the relation of SOS on EOS < climatic variables across all bioomes and even in areas with deciduous forest.

###### Divergent responses of phenology and growth to summer and autumnal warming

**Permanent note:** YES

Warming in result to climate change is not seasonally uniform and substantial asymmetric seasonal warming has been reported not only for high latitudes, but also for temperate regions. 

Changes in plant phenology alter the GS length with consequent influence on ecosystem structure and functioning, such as plant productivityt and carbon and nutrient cycling

They showed delayed autumn senescence in response to warmer temperature becaue of the activity of photosynthetic enzymes that could be maitained at a a higher level under warmer conditions in autumn. The degradation rate of chlorophyll would decrease and timming of senescnece would be delayed.

Warmer autumn led to increased growth of seedlings. This may result in 2 causes:

1. delayed leaf senesnce increases photosynthetic carbon gains due to the later degradation of chlrioophyll and extends the growing season(source-driven timing of foliar senescence)

2. Higher temperatures extend the growth of wood and leadf to a later foliar senescence (sink-driven timing of foliar senescence)\

They showed that the timing of autumn senescence and growth respond differentailly to nonuniform seasonal warming.

### 22 November

###### Effect of climate warming on the timing of autumn leaf senescence reverses after the summer solstice
**Permanent notes:** YES

Early season warming, causing earlier spring leaf-out and faster growth and tissue maturation tends to advance EOS dates. Late season warming has the opposite effect i.e. delaying EOS. Increased temperatures and physiological early in the seasonmight drive earlier leaf senescence through a variety of mechanisms, including developmental and nutrient constraints, seasonal buildup of water stress and radiation induced leaf aging.In contrast, later in the season, a direct effect of temperature is likely to drive the timing of leaf senescence. If both are correct, then climate warming ahs opposing effects at the start and end of the growing season with a reversal of effects somwhere in between. 

The progression of senescence should be slowed down by warmer autumns, lengthening the overall senescence period

Their results show that the onset of senescence is driven by pre-solstice vegetation activity and development, while the speed of its progfression depends on autum temperature.

When they removed the effect of pre-solstice temeprature or photosynthesis on senescence onset, by including the variable as a fixed effect, the model predicted delays in EOS10 dates of 0.8 to 1.4 days per decade. Which highlights how strong pre-solstice vegetation activity that is driven by temperature affects the start of senescence.

They reveal that the productivity before the summer solstce is linked to early senescence dates accross the whole northen hemisphere. This implies a widespread constraint on future growing-season extensions in response to global warming. This contradicts european research suggesting a negative feedback between growing-season productivity driving earlier senesncece.

###### Impact of microclimatic conditions and resource availability on spring and autumn phenology of temperate tree seedlings
**Permanent notes:** YES

A major limitation of plant physiological and phenological studies carried out under natural conditions is that they usually use the temperature from weather station. However, the microclimate in forests or near buds acan largely deviate from 2m heigh air temperature. 

The sensitivity of leaf senescence to environmentasl stress appears to depend on species' resistance strategies and the severity of the stressor, which can le;ad to constrastng results among co-existing trees

Methods: We We estimated the above-ground biomass using the allometric equation provided by Annigh  ̈ ofer et al. (2016) as follows:

Increased nutrient availability was found to delay leaf senescence in Populus trichocarpa. Therefore, senescence, appears to be largely driven by the interaction between nutrient, particularly nitrogen and carbon supply. High nutrietns will therefore allow trees to maintain source activity (photosynthesis) for a longer time and shed their leaves later. However, no biomass increment was found in their experimentfor the freilised treatments.

They found that reduced light delayed leaf senescence of ash, cherry and beech with a reduction of biomass increment.  Can be explained by the sink limitastion hypothesis. I.e. shaded conditions over summer led to reduced carbon uptake  due to lower photosynthetic activity and subsequently delayed the senescence process. 

They showed the importance of microclimatic conditions, especially solar radiation  in regulating buburst and leaf senesence

###### An earlier start of growing season can affect tree radial growth through regulating cumulative growth rate

**Permanent notes:** YES

The extent at which tree xylem growth will respond to warming and precipitation changes remains to be explored. Yes it is a fundamental question to predict the impacts of climate change on forest growth. 

Xylem growth in tree trucks (what the fuck is that) sequestrates the carbohydrate produced by leaf photosynthesis, which contributes to the long-term carbon storage of forests. Therefore, annual xylem growth is charactreized as periodic cambium activity and its relationships with climate factors has been reported extesnively adn atracted great attention. E.g. temperature triggers cambium activity in Northern Hemiusphere conifers. Also, recent studies suggest that photoperiods play an important role in controlling the spring growth initiation. 

We can observe xylem growth dynamics by monitoring micro-cores on a fine spatial-temporal scale, but long-term and continuous monitoring is expensive and labor-consuming, expecially in cold regions. 

They found a method based on process-based VS-model that comineds temperature, precipitation and photoperiod. The simulation results are more accurate. 

Phenology helps us obtain the duration of the growing season, which determiens the amount of time available to develop functional xylem throught cell maturation and lignification. 

A recent study shows that an early season can promote tree growth in cold humid areas but inhibit tree growth in dry areas. Droughts caused by warming have led to a decline in tree growth in many regions, including the northern hemisphere. Drought may lead to xylem embolism, which affects water transport,  reduced water use efficiency, reduces tree growth and increases the possibility of disease and insect pests. 

Other studies showed that the beneficial effects of spring warmth on GS productivity were offset by carbon losses due to water stress in summer and autumn.

Growth rate has a more direct influence on tree growth than the growing season length. Growth rate is complex and regulated by various envrionemental factors. In boreal forests, warming-induced earlier growth recovery has a positive effect on tree radial growth.

Studies have found that precipitation of the early seasonm, might have a more direct effect on tree growth by affecting teh rate of cambium cell division and enlargment. 

They showed that in their northen region, radial growth was promoted by advanced SOS, but no effect in the south.

###### Cold adaptation recorded in tree rings highlights risks associated with climate change and assisted migration

**Permanent notes:** YES 

Environmental changes are going faster than plant populations can adapt. This mis-match is expected to destabilize ecosystems by decreasing productivity while increasing mortality. Maladapted plant populations may further contribute to climate change through reduced carbon sequestration or may even turn into significant source of CO2. To mitigate such consequences, assisted migration has been proposed for reforestation programs.

Assisted migratiopn involves changing the genetic composition of plant populations by moving seed material to climate regions where they are anticipated to be well adapted in the future. 

Growing northern seed sources at southern planting sites involves a climate transfer that can simulate projected warming, with the growth response being predictive of future performance under realisistic long-termin field conditions. Conversely, moving sourthern seeds to the north can test the performance of warm-adapted populations under currerntly colder environments, thereby suggesting limits to seed transfer. 

Tree rings can provide additional information for evaluating cold adaptation since they provide a record of how past cliamte has influenced growth. 2 anatomical features have been linked to cold and frost: 1. layers of deformed, collapsed tracheids and traumatic parenchyma cells (frost rings). Frost years during which there was frosts in periods of cambium activity. 2. Light rings consist of layers of cells that are incompletely lignified and have been associated with frost events that kill the cells before teh lignification process is complete.

###### Differentiation and Non-Linear Responses in Temporal Phenotypic Plasticity of Seasonal Phenophases in a Common Garden of Crataegus monogyna Jacq.
Kristine Vander Mijnsbrugge, 2019
**Permanent notes:** YES

All individuals in a common garden share the same envionement, any average difference in a trait between provenances of the same species has a genetic origin. 

Within populations, individual trees display variabale timing of bud burst, which is suggested to have genetic cause. Individual trees  in a population can teherfore be cataegorized as early intermediate and late pehnological forms.

No relationship between the timing of cambial activity and bud burst in Quercus robur. 

The emergence and growth of new spring foliage in temperate deciduous trees relies strongly on the nutrients that were resorbed during the preceding leaf senescence.

In 59 species, the timing of autumn senescence displayed a pattern according to the climatic clines of the home-sites of the studies populations, which was clearer than the pattern observerd in bud burst timing. 

Leaves that emerged after a late spring frosdt in beech and oak displayed a higher photosynthesis rate and a delayed leaf senescence in autumn, compensating for spring frost damage and demonstrating that long-lived trees can adadt their autumn phenology depending on preceding productivity. 

Phenotypic plasticity: range of phenotypes taht a plant can express as a function of teh environement. Genetically controlled, heritable phenotypic plasticity has the potential to influence plant evolution. Species that can adjust their pheno resposnes to warming spring by earlier bud burst or earlier flowering show better performance when compared to less responsive species.

###### Interpreting common garden studies to understand cueing mechanisms of spring leafing phenology in temperate and boreal tree species
**Permanent notes:** YES

In temperate and boreal regions, both photoperiod and light spectral properties (both red and far red(R:FR) and blue wavelenghts) change in greographically complicated ways during the perioid affecting leafing phenology.

Apart from dawn and dusk, daytime R:FR is very constant at ground level, and is barely afgfected by clouds

R:FR affects plants via phytochromes, the main photoreceptors actrive at long wavelengths. They switch from with exposure to different rations of red and far red light. This physiology affects phenology

###### Seed transfer and climate change effects on radial growth of jack pine populations in a common garden in Petawawa, Ontario, Canada
**Permanent notes:** YES

Method: common garden study. They did a provenance trial and took cores at 50 cm above ground to ensure a maxium number of tree rings. They used a 0.04 linear resolution step size for measurements.M

Annual basal area increment per tree (TRA) in the year n was calculated as a non-linear function of the cumulative tree radius (R) in the year n1 and tree-ring width (TRW) in the year n. They present a basal tree-ring area increment for each tree ring. 

They excluded the first years of rings to to 1. avoid the distinct trend related to tree age in the early years and 2. Allow erxtension of our growth seed-source orgigin models to tree-ring date

- **Tree-ring width** measures the thickness of a 
  single year's growth ring. This can vary depending on tree species, 
  environmental conditions, and other factors.

- **Basal area** is the cross-sectional area of the trunk at a specific height, usually 
  expressed in square centimeters or square meters. It is calculated as:

- **Basal Area Increment** quantifies the change in basal 
  area from one year to the next. This allows researchers to assess how 
  much growth the tree adds annually in terms of trunk cross-section, not 
  just linear growth. It reflects the tree's overall volume or biomass 
  accumulation more accurately than ring width alone

Radial growth represents actual, integrated measures of tree and stand wood production. Studies of this characteristic over long periods of time increases the reliability of modeling efforts and conclusions. They showed that the southern seed sources could out-perform local populations in diameter and height growth. Southern seed sources might be better adapted to warming temperatures.

###### Tree rings provide a new class of phenotypes for genetic associations that foster insights into adaptation of conifers to climate change
**Permanent notes:** YES

Two genomic strategies are commonly used to search for genes involved in local adaptation to climate:

1. Genotype-environment ssociation (GEA) method that looks for correlations between genetic markers and envionmmental variables from where populations/individuals originate
   
   1. Does not provide information about the phenotypic traits controlled by the candidate genes.

2. Genotype-phenotype assocation ; GPA: test for associations between genotypes growing in a common environmment and traists of interest
   
   1. Has the advantage of establishing more direct links between genes and traits potentially under selection
   
   2. Disadvantage: in tree species, the list of functional traits that closly reflect adaptation to climate is still rather limited and labor intensive. 

Dendroecology: cambial activity is an integrative indicator that accounts for physiological mechanisms such as responses to drought stress, phenology of dormancy and resistance to freezing injuries.

Definition of provenance: geographic and climatic origin of a population and the term "population" when referring to the trees grown from seed sampled at the provenance 

Cool figure to descrive the treer-ring trait assests in establishing the links betweeen genotypes, phenotypes and evenionemental selection pressures acting on trees.

Tree ring phenotypes for association genetics: 

Type A: basal area increment (BAI)

Type B: Growth response to past extreme climatic events

Type C: climate sensitivity : relationship between growth time series and climatic fluctuations

Methods: Cool figure showing BAI RAW chronologie, standardised and mean ring density as a function of year and including mean annual temperature of the provenance MATp

They showed that tree-ring traits measured in common garden experiments offer great potential to unravel local adaptation in forests trees through a fine-scale retrospective and dynamic view of tree resposnes to past environmental variations

###### Tree-rings to climate relationships in nineteen provenances of four black pines sub-species (Pinus nigra Arn.) growing in a common garden from Northwest Tunisia
**Permanent notes:** YES

Tree rings are very reliable indicators of forest health and decline. However, a large amount of factors contribute to ring-width variations which must be removed by standardization procedures from ring-width series in order to isolate the influence of climate. 

Methods: All cores were mounted on wooden supports and thoroughly polished with progressively finer sand paper.

###### Cambial phenology, wood formation and temperature thresholds in two contrasting years at high altitude in southern Italy
**Permanent notes:**YES

During the growing season, some variability exists in growth onset and duration becasue of intra-annual differences in weather, with cambium reactivation in spring being highly dependant on temperature.  Wood formation involves cambial cell division and cell expansion followed by secondary wall production. They are regulated by gene expression and hormonal signals, but also environmental factors, such as temperature and precipitation. They ask the question whether there is a link between changes in cambial phenology and intraannual wood formation. E.g. changes in duration of wood formation induced by a change in cambial phenology might result in modification to ring-width formaiton.

They showed that temperature tresholds in contrasting springs provide strong evidence that temperature largeely determines the onset,  cessation and duration of wood formation.

They showed taht spring temperatures modify the duration of xylogenesis which had a daily mean air `temperature` treshold of 8C. 

### 2 December

###### Tree-ring variation, wood formation and phenology of beech (Fagus sylvatica) from a representative site in Slovenia, SE Central Europe
**Permanent notes:** YES
The application of densitometry showed that within and between year density variations in beech provide more information at higher temporal resolution than tree-rings only. 

Analysis of wood anotomy provides better resolution since the morphology of the cells records the effects of different factors on a finer scale during the time of wood formation. 

In Northern Germany, wood formation data weas combined with pheno data (Schhmitt et al. 2000) and in the Netherlands with long term tree ring and climate (Werf van der et al. 2007)

Beech. They showed that peak wood formation happened from the end of May to the beginning of June which is more than 2 weeks before the summer solstice. Wood formation in the Netherlands ended in October and in the Netherlands in September.  

###### Tree-rings, genetics and the environment: Complex interactions at the rear edge of species distribution range
**Permanent notes:** YES

The climatic signal captured in tree-ring series is stronger in a stressful or constrained environment

They showed that the genetic background of Pinus cembra had limited influence on the interannual fluctuations of radial tree growth and their resposnes to climatic variability

###### Where, why and how? Explaining the low-temperature range limits of temperate tree species
**Permanent notes:** YES

They hypothesized that seed set will be diminished, seed quality and viability will be reduced and germination will be less successful in high compared to low-elevation seed provenances was falsified.  No evidence that reproductive potential at the upper range llimit is diminished under current climate conditions (for the species they studied. )

Radial growth of their trees always correlated with growing season mean temperatur, irrespective of elevation. The annual variation of the length of the GS has an effect on radial growth only when temperatures are generally warmer. Because the timew required for new cell formation increases nonlineraly with decreasing temperatures., a longer season at low temperatures will only produce few additional cell rows, whereas a longer season at high temperatures can produce many more cell rows, particularly when spring is warm --> sets the size of the cambial zone. 

**THE FOLLOWING IS ALREADY IN slipbox** 

*Their common garden experiments revealed small, but consisten genetic differentiation of spriong phenology among provenances of seedlings originating from different elevations,e xcept for the treeline species which underlines the importance of the timing of growth and development for tree success. Fagus Sylvatica from high elevation provenances flushed earlier than those at low elevations as observed previously. Provenances from high elevations tended to set their buds earlier in autumn than low provenances. Overall, phenology of populations from high elevations was less responsive to temperature and presumably more strongly tied to chilling requirements and or photoperiod than in populations from low elevations*

*Cool picture of the triangular control of species range limiets which outlines the species-specific trade-off between 1. Risk of freezing damage in spring, 2. Risk of tentering the dormant season with immature tissue 3. Timing of spring phenology.
High-elevation provenances exhibited slower growth rates than low-elevation provenances in half of the studied species ***

They showed that leaf thickness and leaf mass per area increased with increasing elevation of the common garden. Provenances did not differ 

they showed that seedlings and adults exert the same freezing resistance during flushing 

There very rarelly any above-ground growth happening below 5C and non-existent below-ground of the studied species. They showed that species from high elevation could grow at lower temperature than those to low elevations. 

They show that species can grow at lower temperatures than those corresponding to their current range limit, but fail to produce ature tissue under these conditions, which limits winter survivorship.

Species range limits are neither winter temperature means, nor extremes are involved in the biological mechanisms responsible for the formation of range limits. LINK to temp extremes that limits range distribution from fredi's article i think. 

They propose a triangular control of species range limits (FIG 5). Where inherent freezing tolerance of foliage in spring selects for a certain phenological control of spring flushing, which truncates the length of GS, and thus, the time available for tissue maturation. 

### BET HEDGING IN A GUILD OF DESERT ANNUALS
LAWRENCE VENABLE
2007
**Permanent notes:** YES
Bet hedging is a risk-spreading strategy used by organisms in highly variable environments. In humans endeavorrs as in reflected, e.g. hedge funds or "don't put your eggs in one basket".
It's also pervasive in the biological world such as it's an unwelcome influence that spreads over a population.

Bet hedging may be involved in characteristic of an organism that buffers it from temporal environemental variation. E.g. perrenial life cycle, variable diapause in animals from crustaceans and mosquitoes to sponges and fish (Look for diapause), resistance of weeds to eradication.

Usually defined in terms of a trade-off between mean and variance of some performance criterion such as population growth, return on investment or Darwinian fitness (Look for this).

Organisms with bet hedging traits should have long-term success, measured as geometric mean succeess.

Link this to EGRET. Classic example of bet hedging is delayed germination in desert annuals. It buffers variation in reproductive success much as cash under the pillow or a conservative financial investment buffers a risky investment. Thus producing a fraction of dormant seeds is the hedge agains the variation associated with germination.

There is no empirical examples of bet hedging that dirrectly assses temporal variation in survival and reproduction in the evolutionarily relevant natural environment and its associated with putative bet hedging traits.

Species that experience greater variance in per capita reproductive success were more responsive to growing season precipitation. This shous be due to differences in physiology and life history. The demographic variation and variation in sensitivity to precipitaton are due, to a trade-off among species between growth rate and water use effiency.

These data reveal an interesting community pattern: a guild of co-occurring plants with a spectrum of demographic variances and correlated germination. These differences are implicated in structuring plant communities and accounting for stable species coexistence in variable environments.

The life history patterns that they showed validate long-standing life history predictions, but also provides an intriguing window on how physiologies and life histories are deployed in comm structures.

### Character Displacement in Flowering Phenologies
Scott Gleeson, 1981
**Permanent notes:** YES

Discussion about the role of competition in interpretations of flowering phenologies have raised questions. More specifically, the hypothesis in dispute is that competition by plant species for pollinators can cause a divergence of flowering times, resulting in a regular sequence of blooming within a season.

If we consider blooming time as a quantitative trait, it is a character displacement argument.

There are 2 important components of a quantitative character that determine its displacement response: the mean and the variance.

Character displacement hypothesis. The ideal system would be one in which a suite of plant species rely exclusively on a single pollinator species during a homogenous flowering season

A lack of appropriate quantitative techniques concealed a basic problem. The very act of ordering blooming times into a sequential phenology produces an impression of regularity.

Poole and Ratchcke presented a new statistical method for distinguishing an evenly spaced phenology from a random one. They showed (with computational error) that the studied flowering phenology wasn't different than random.

The meaning of Poole and Rathcke's test depend on the null hypothesis of randomly spaced mean flowering times. If there were one optimal time to bloom for all plant species, in the absence of competition, all species would bloom simultaneously. Their test is more rigourous than the other that present a null hypothesis of simultaneous bloom (where a random phenology would doubtless be) because their null hypothesis corresponds to the more buologically interesting assumption of an initially disorganized community composed, e.g. of species colonising from a diversity of habitatts. Deviation from this condition would suggest a community that had acquired some organization in response to displacement pressure.

competition in such communities would result in competitive exclusion and selective retention of immgrant species or coevolution by character displacement of the initially random species assemblage. Either cases would have various inhibitions to the emergence of a truly even phenology.

If plant species are compressing their blooming periods in response to competition, we would expect a correlation between blooming duration and some measure of temporal aggregation i.e. more tightly clumped species are in a season , the shorter their blooming periods.

### Climatic Changes Lead to Declining Winter Chill for Fruit and Nut Trees in California during 1950–2099
eIKE Luedeling, 2009
**Permanent notes:** YES

≈
For species that rely on overlap between male and female flowering, such as walnuts and pistachios, insufficient chilling can reduce pollination and reduce crop yields.

They used 2 different mathematical models : Chilling hours Model and Dynamic Model (superior in subtropical climates)

Chilling hours model counts the number of hours during winter when temperatures are between 0 and 7.2 C.

Dynamic model assumes that winter chill is accumultaed in a 2-step process. An intermidate chilling product is first formed by a process that requires cool temmperatures. This intermediate product whose formation is enhanced by moderate temperatures can be destroyed by high temperaturs. When a sufficient amount of intermidiate product has accumulated it's converted irreversibly into a chill portion.

They propose the concept of "safe winter chill" which is the amount of chilling that can safely be expected in 90% of all years and quantify the change in area of safe winter chill for exemplary crop species. They believe that this metric is more useful for tree crop growers than mean winter chill, since it incorporates the economic need for an orchard operation to produce good yields in most years rather than in an average year.

Climate change may have other consequence (positive or negative) than winter chilling modifications. Rising summer temperatures can be expected to be beneficial to some crops, while having

### Constraints and Competition in the Evolution of Flowering Phenology
John Kochmer, 1986
**Permanent notes:** YES
To explain flowering phenology, most empiral and theoritical studies have folloed the suggestion of Robertson 1895 that flowering time is modified by natural selection to avoid competition for pollinators. The fitness reduction driving this process may be the result of decreased seed-set casued by pollinator limitation, the low success of hybrid seeds produced by intraspecific pollination, loss of pollen, or pollen tube clogging.

If many species compete for pollination, flowering times should become spread through the season. However, in many ecosystems, they do not fulfill predictions of the comp. hypothesis. In some cases, flowering times are aggregated or are statistically not different from random generated patterns. This highlights that community patterns of flowering result of optimization of pollination.

Robertson 1924: Every natural group [of flowering plants] has a definite position. It begins at a given time, increases to a maximum point and then declines until all of its members are out of bloom. Their seasons do not coincide but they overlap

Research question: do life history and phylogenetic constraints influence the evolution of flowering phenology in the animal-pollinated plants of temperate floras?

They defice phylogenetic constraints to denote properties shared by the members of a monophyletic grop by virtue of their common ancestry and which lmiit the response of these taxa to directional selection.

We can only talk about phylogenetic constraints when the taxa studied are truly monophyletic.

3 hypothesis for the evolution of flowering time. 1. Competition in the absence of constraints. It's been argued that flowering times are mostly due to seasonal displacement of sympatric, synchronously flowering competitors as a means of minimizing fitness reduction. Should lead to seasonal displacement of the flowering ties of competitors throughout the season. If there is selection for divergent flowering times in the absence of phylogenetic or life form constraints, a flora should have the folowing properties a) families of a flora should not differ in flowering time. b) Selection for divergent flowering times should be strongest among members of a family, so there should be considerable selection pressure for species of a family to spread flowering times through the year. c) Members of a give family would have the same dates of flowering in different parts of the world only in theunlikely situation that selective pressures on flowering time are identifical in the 2 regions.

Phylogenetic constraints hypothesis. If phylogenetic constraints affected flowering time, the following prediction should hold: a) Families have different phylogenetic constraints, if so, they would differ in mean flowering times. b) A family's total range of flowering should be a positive functinon of the nb of species in the family. c) if phylogentic constraints are global properties of families and if phylogenetic constraints are stronger than local selective pressures, species of a family should flower on similar dates regardless of their geographic locations.

Life form constraint hypothesis: would predict that species of different life forms should differ significantly in mean flowering times, regardless of family membership.

Their results fulfill the predictions of the phylogentic constraints hypothesis

If we take a time frame of 1000 years, selection for woody species, fewer than 100 generations during which selection could have acted on phenology. Thus, not enough time for competitors to have achieved optimization of complex ecological characters such as flowering time.
