On growing season and senescence. Autumn warming delays senescence dates by up to 8 days/1 degree increase.

Keenan predicted that by each day of advance spring leaf out = uptake of 45kg carbon/ha. Predicited each day deleay in autumn senescent = uptake of 98kg/ha.

Piao found carbon losses in longer growing season.

Delayed leaf senescence doesn’t necessarily translate to elevated plant productivity. Warmer springs and summers can also lead to earlier growth cessation. 

**Ok**

Despite keeping their green colour, leaves reduce photosynthetic capacity after summer solstice. There is also the fact that in autumn, there is declining radiation. 

Plant photosynthesis is not only regulated by environemental cues. It’s also limited by feedbacks between sink (growth) and source activity (photosynthesis). Therefore, autumn productivity appears to be limited by plant’s carbon sink strength (e.g. nutrient limitation). **what if we don’t limit nutrient?

For biomass measurements, they waited until all plants were in full dormancy to prevent respiratory carbon losses

**Pretransplant fertilization of containerized Picea mariana seedlings: calibration and bioassay growth response**

Hardening period: shortly after bud formation, overwintering tissues undergo a long hardening period that is perceived by shorter photoperiod and reinforced by cold temperature as they enter dormancy phase.

Nutrient build-up in seedlings can be high, but the carry-over effect of high fertilization on root-plug nutrient status into the hardening period is short lived, probably because of continued plant uptake and leaching. *** leaching : lessivage

**Concepts in empirical plant ecology**

The assumption that individuals are resource limited is misleading. It’s based on agronomic perception because it’s focused on biomass production, whereas ecological concept of limitation accounts for evolutionary fitness i.e. reproductive performance of a plant relative to its neighbours (conspecific individuals or other species). The term optimum is often ambivalent and doesn’t account for a community. E.g. in a semi-arid community, if there is more water, at first there won’t be new taxa, but after the transition period, new species assemblage and = change in community. 

Definition of stress:

Should not be defined as the absence of optimal growth conditions. If that was the definition, plants in the wild would be permanently stressed. Stress is best applied to situations in which plants experience severe constraints that drastically diminish their reproductive success so that they can become locally extinct.

**A new process-based model for predicting autumn phenology: How is leaf senescence controlled by photoperiod and temperature coupling?**

They define the vegetation growing season as the leaf unfolding date in spring to the leaf colouration in autumn. These 2 phenomenons can act as a link between climate change and biogeochemical cycles. 

Growing season shifts may influence exchange capacities of carbon, water and energy among land surfaces and atmosphere = ecosystem productivity variations. This will in turn affect the global carbon balance and climate change. 

Changes in autumn leaf phenology in temperate forests can better explain variation in annual net ecosystem productivity (NEP) than spring phenology. Delayed autumn leaf senescence —> increased NEP.

**DONE**

There is a consensus that leaf senescence is controlled by photoperiod and temperature. As days shorten and temperature decreases, an abscission zone starts to form at the base of the petiole and chlorophyll degradation occurs. 

At latitudes where severe winters occurs, it seems like photoperiodic regulation is stronger than temperature whereas winters are less severe, temperature exerts a certain amount of control over autumn phenology. But we don’t know how much is split between photoperiod and temperature for many species. 

Precision: their study was conducted on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. 

Their results show that minimum temperature may trigger leaf-senescence through decreasing light-saturated photosynthetic rate( not sure what that means) and limiting merismetic activity in shoot

Definition of bud set: growth cessation. It’s independent of autumn senescence. Senescence cannot be initiated until a certain time after growth cessation.

**Acclimation of phenology relieves leaf longevity constraints in deciduous forests**

We have reliable models to predict SOC (Start of season) based on accumulated temperature and photoperiod. In contrast, long-term trends in autumn senescence are less clear, depend on end of season (EOS) definitions bases on senescence start, leaf discolouration stages or dormancy, and **drivers are not mwell understood.** 

Experiments showed warm autumns = delayed leaf senescence. However, long-term observations often don’t show an association between phenology and autumn warming. 

One study (cited in the article): found a strong relationship between observed EOS and simulated net carbon assimilation, such that greater productivity was associated with earlier leaf senescence (where does that leave me?). This negative relationship was interpreted as a plant response to C sink saturation whereby an early replenishment of non-structural carbon reserves induces an early cessation of teh photosynthetically active season. 

In that sense, EOS advancement is predicted as SOS is early and plant can saturate their non structural carbon reserves. 

**Phenotypic plasticity of leaves enhances water-stress tolerance and promotes hydraulic conductivity in a tall conifer**

On Segi.

They studied Segi’s anatomy at an elevation gradient. They hypothesized that the structure of foliage within crowns of tall sequoia varies in response to gradients of water/light availability. 

**Asymmetric effects of cooler and warmer winters on beech phenology last beyond spring**

Phenological response to temperature and photoperiod differs a lot among coexisting species. In that sense, climate change will likely affect the competition among species and shift their distribution. 

Spring leaf phenology has advanced by many days. However, warmer climate has a dual role that affects both dormancy release in winter and the initiation of bud development in spring. 

It’s reported that there is now more forcing requirements. That is the result of insufficient chillling requirement for full dormancy release.

Criticism from the authors: most studies focus on a single phenophase and therefore don’t consider the potential effect of one phenophase to the other phenophases occuring within the same growing season. Nor do they consider from one year to the next one i.e. the carryover effect.

**Plant Phenology and global climate change: Current progresses and challenges**

Climate change has greatly shifted major events. E.g. spring and autumn, but also caused phenological mismatch across trophic levels. This can have strong impacts on community structures and ecosystem functions. E.g. different phenological responses to warming between plants and animals can lead to bird species not breeding at the time when the food isn’t at it’s maximum supply. E.g. this can also cause teh reduction in seed production for some tree species. 

Changes in phenology that are caused by warming are also a primary cause for the recent increases in vegetation activity and carbon uptake

In the second paragraph of the first section of the methodology, they provide an. example of BBCH. It's a system that has provided a uniform definition of plant development stages. 

On remote sensing: the spatial resolution of satellite data varies from 30 m to several km. Therefore, the retrieval and interpretation of stands with mixed canopies where several species are present and different phenophases co-occur at the same time. 

2.4 Manipulative experiments

Using only phenology obvservations, it's very difficult to reveal the covarying drivers of phenology and  gain insights in the mechanisms that drive the patterns in the observations and changes. To understand more the mechanisms of plant phenology, manipulatve experiments have been proven to be a very useful tool. 

There are types of climate warming experiments : passive and active warming. Both show similar results: spring leafing is highly sensitive to manipulate warming. 

Downsides of manipulative experiments:

1. Most experiments are conducted for a handful of species adn usually have only lasted a few years. This short term may not suffice to induce adaptive responses or to gain complete understanding of long-term pheno responses of plants to environmental changes. 
   
   That's because other ecological processes may play an increasing role overtime. E.g. nutrient availability and thermal acclimation. 

2. Only conducted on seedlings or saplings and rarely on mature trees. Young and mature trees may show very different responses to the same environemental changes.

3. Phenological responses to experimental and natural conditions may differ a lot. 

They mention that despite these limitations, they have the advantage of keeping certain conditions constant, so they are ideal to answer hypothesis testing.  

Few studies have documented the phenological events in the fall. Evidence tend to point towards a delaying trend in the end date of autumn. Much weeker than in the spring though. 

*Thought: could that weeker trend be caused by the fact than autumn phenological events are not as "clear cut as the spring's?*

##### Drivers and mechanisms:

1. Temperature

Response of phenological events is largely non-linear. In autumn and early spring, cooling has a dual role. 1. chilling activates plant stress responses and stimulates plant endodormancy (first stage of plant dormancy). Then a certain amount of accumulated chilling is required to break endodormancy and lead plants into the second dormant stage (ecodormancy). During that stage, the growth of meristem cells is stimulated and plant cell elongation accelarates under warm temperature that is quantified as growing degree-days.

Spring phenology is more responsive to warming during daytime than to nightime temperature



2. Photoperiod

The increasing night length in autumn induces bud set and leaf senescence when photoperiod is bellow a growth-permitting treshold.

E.g. leaf senescence of mature European aspens is mostly regulated by  photoperiod (happens on the same day every year)

Photoperiod effect on spring phenology is unclear unlike its effect on fall phenology. 

With warming-induced leaf out advancement, reduced photperiod earlier in spring may decrease the temperature sensitivity of spring phenology and thus prevent the plants from leafing out too early = potential spring frost. 

Photoperiod sensitivity of spring phenological events might vary among species/latitudes. 

3. Nutrient and water availability

They can affect plant phenology, but their extend is <temperature and photoperiod. 

Nutrients can affect plant's phenology. E.g. enough nutrient during the GS may enhance the plant's resistance and adaptation to freezing stress, thus postponing autumn leaf senesence. 

Studies found that water availability may play a key role in spring and autumn events. Altough not enough empirical evidence. 

4. Interaction among phenological events

Recent studies found that spring and autumn phenology are positively intercorrelated. Underlying mechanisms might related to leaf traits stuch as leaf longetivity and programmed cell death. The interaction between spring and autumn phenology will likely modify pheno responses to climate change. 



##### Ecosystem and climatic impacts of pheno changes

Climate-induced phenology changes may reshape community structure, because of the diverse range of plant pheno responses to climate change. E.g. a study showed that species growing in a cool climate are more sensitive to warming climate then those in warm regions. Convergence of phenological events accross a temperature gradient could increase gene flow accross lat/long.

Impacts accross trophic levels: alter the interactions between plants and herbivores. 



Plant phenological shifts may alter soil moisture, run-off and precipitation primarily through influencing evapotranspiration.

Plant phenological changes can also produce extra biological forcing on surface temperature by directly modifying surface conductance and albedo (and indirectly modifying cloud formation). Earlier leaf out = larger amount of solar radiation absorption that heats the canopy surface. This mechanism is espacially important for snow-covered boreal regions due to the large contrast between snow albedo adn new-leaf albedo. 



##### Challenges

Currently, phenomodels use phenological records. Underlying mechanistic processes governing phenological events are rarely incorporated into models or only empirically represented via statistical relationships.
