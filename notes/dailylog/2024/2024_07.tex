This morning, I tried adding a table of contents to this dailylog. I don't know why it's so complicated, but I could't figure out a way to do it. I let that go. 
\par Then I tried installing Stan on R, as Deirdre suggested. It didn't work either. I will ask her when she's back from vacation. 
\par I worked for most of the afternoon on my script for the shoot elongation measurements. It doesn't look too bad! I needed a break, so I went to install hobo light loggers in the climate chambers so I can see how much light they are giving to the trees when they are in there. I also brought back the bepas that were in the lab to totem field. 
\par at totem, I monitored bud set for prvi and took pictures of the acne. For prvi, I think they are far more advanced than I was expecting. Some of them seem to already be at complete dormancy. For acne, it's confusing. Mildew have impacted them a lot. They show very tiny leaves, but they have been there for a while now, so as Fredi told me, it might just be the upcoming scales that will cover the bud. 
\par I removed the drippers from the Segi. I will put them back on Friday. After discussing with Fredi, we thought giving them a water break would be good.
\par I came back to the office to finish what I started. 
\par I modified slightly Fredi's notes on budset so they keep going after 4 (5,6,7,0)

Lizzie, Mao and I talked about getting a power bank for the lab. Lizzie ordered it. It should arrive on Friday.
Fredi and I discussed about literature reviews, how he does them and where I should start\\
Britany and I discussed the fertilization plan and we figured that there are no good amount we could add to the trees. We rather run in the problem of the studies used seedlings and not saplings. A lot of them were using \% of N, P or K of leaf tissue and not actually of much mg were added to the plants. I also discussed this with Fredi. He suggested looking at the atmospheric deposition, but I argued that this is for a whole ecosystem and figuring out how much nutrients a sapling is actually getting would be hard and perhaps impossible. So I just decided to be consistent and add nutrients again this week. I'll do this just after we weed all the plants.

\textbf {Christophe + Britany}
We started the shoot elongation measurements. As I won't be there next week, I showed Britany how to take the measurements. We didn't have time to log in the paper ruler measuremnts.
\par Dan delivered the organic spray bottles to keep killing the powdery mildew (some of the new shoots are getting it again). He also delivered the fertilizer. It's the same one as last time. I will fertilize the trees perhaps on Thursday
\par I asked him to reduce the watering of all trees to once a day, in the morning for 15 minutes, instead of 3x a day.
\par In the afternoon, I started a new cv file on latex\\
Deirdre and I talked about litterature reviews\\ 
I finished my power point presentation for the lab meeting tomorrow on research tools.\\
Deirdre and I tried to trouble shoot the installation of Stan on my computer. It still doesn't work. I'll try again maybe tomorrow -- although I won't have time with the budset and other things
