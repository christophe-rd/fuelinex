\textbf {Christophe}
This morning, I tried adding a table of contents to this dailylog. I don't know why it's so complicated, but I could't figure out a way to do it. I let that go. 
\par Then I tried installing Stan on R, as Deirdre suggested. It didn't work either. I will ask her when she's back from vacation. 
\par I worked for most of the afternoon on my script for the shoot elongation measurements. It doesn't look too bad! I needed a break, so I went to install hobo light loggers in the climate chambers so I can see how much light they are giving to the trees when they are in there. I also brought back the bepas that were in the lab to totem field. 
\par at totem, I monitored bud set for prvi and took pictures of the acne. For prvi, I think they are far more advanced than I was expecting. Some of them seem to already be at complete dormancy. For acne, it's confusing. Mildew have impacted them a lot. They show very tiny leaves, but they have been there for a while now, so as Fredi told me, it might just be the upcoming scales that will cover the bud. 
\par I removed the drippers from the Segi. I will put them back on Friday. After discussing with Fredi, we thought giving them a water break would be good.
\par I came back to the office to finish what I started. 
\par I modified slightly Fredi's notes on budset so they keep going after 4 (5,6,7,0)

\textbf {Christophe + Britany}
We started the shoot elongation measurements. As I won't be there next week, I showed Britany how to take the measurements. We didn't have time to log in the paper ruler measuremnts.
\par Dan delivered the organic spray bottles to keep killing the powdery mildew (some of the new shoots are getting it again). He also delivered the fertilizer. It's the same one as last time. I will fertilize the trees perhaps on Thursday
\par I asked him to reduce the watering of all trees to once a day, in the morning for 15 minutes, instead of 3x a day.
