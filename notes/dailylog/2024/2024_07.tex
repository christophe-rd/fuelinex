This morning, I tried adding a table of contents to this dailylog. I don't know why it's so complicated, but I could't figure out a way to do it. I let that go. 
\par Then I tried installing Stan on R, as Deirdre suggested. It didn't work either. I will ask her when she's back from vacation. 
\par I worked for most of the afternoon on my script for the shoot elongation measurements. It doesn't look too bad! I needed a break, so I went to install hobo light loggers in the climate chambers so I can see how much light they are giving to the trees when they are in there. I also brought back the bepas that were in the lab to totem field. 
\par at totem, I monitored bud set for prvi and took pictures of the acne. For prvi, I think they are far more advanced than I was expecting. Some of them seem to already be at complete dormancy. For acne, it's confusing. Mildew have impacted them a lot. They show very tiny leaves, but they have been there for a while now, so as Fredi told me, it might just be the upcoming scales that will cover the bud. 
\par I came back to the office to finish what I started. 
\par I modified slightly Fredi's notes on budset so they keep going after 4 (5,6,7,0)
