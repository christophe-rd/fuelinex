I went to the campus in the morning to fix the biochambers. It took me a couple of hours. I had to fix the drains, clean the filters. It was a mess.

Had something to do downtown this morning. Then, I got an apartment visit and arrived on campus around 10:30 to meet with Fredi so we could discuss about the senescence monitoring and other stuff. \\
Then Mao and I met with Mark for an interview at 1pm. \\
I worked on the chambers again in the afternoon.\\
I worked on a figure Fredi and I discussed it could be good to have to visualize the warm fall treatment. I updated my futur daily logs and finished the one from August. \\
I emailed Patrick for the schedule of the fall treatment.

I arrived at the office around 9am. Since it's Imagine day, I didn't have the biomathematics class. I emailed a bunch of people and went to check how the bio-chambers repairs were going. It should be done by the end of the day. However, two of the lights won't be installed for my experiment. 
I met with Lizzie in the afternoon to talk about senescence monitoring, the frequency at which I should monitor this, etc. \\
I kept on doing some figures for my treatment schedule in the climate chambers.

Arrived at the office around 9:00 to interview Anoya.
At 10:00 I went to fix the walk in chamber only to realize that there is no drain to evacuate the water. That will require me to remove the plants every two days from the chambers.
Then I went to Totem to take pictures of the plants to monitor senescence. It took me 34 minutes to photograph 180 trees. I might not even ever use this data.\\

I met Teresa at 11:30 to talk about the agroforestry class.  We talked for a bit and then walked to the class. I attended the class and I think it will be very cool and interesting! \\
After this, I went back to Totem to finish taking pictures of the plants and Mao joined me so we could start monitor senescence. We discussed what Fredi
