I went to the campus in the morning to fix the biochambers. It took me a couple of hours. I had to fix the drains, clean the filters. It was a mess.

Had something to do downtown this morning. Then, I got an apartment visit and arrived on campus around 10:30 to meet with Fredi so we could discuss about the senescence monitoring and other stuff. \\
Then Mao and I met with Mark for an interview at 1pm. \\
I worked on the chambers again in the afternoon.\\
I worked on a figure Fredi and I discussed it could be good to have to visualize the warm fall treatment. I updated my futur daily logs and finished the one from August. \\
I emailed Patrick for the schedule of the fall treatment.
