We left again around 8:30 for AE10 and Paradise. It's cloudy and cold again for the second day in a row. We hiked all the way to paradise when we realized that it was very wet and slippery. We decided it wasn't safe to work so we hiked down and went back home. Avery, Britany and Mao went to core 6 new trees from the first plot we did because they weren't great when we first cored them. I took a nap and worked on my project. Mostly for the fall biochambers schedule and looked at the data Justin and Ken recorded.
Lizzie and Jonathan came to meet me at the house. We discussed gps points and how the fieldwork was going. I made fritata for dinner.

We left at 8:15. Cloudy and cold again. We went to meet Lizzie and Jonathan at Longmire campground at 8:30 and headed up to AE10. We forgot the box with all the data sheets which slowed us down a bit. We finished the plot around 10:30 and headed to Paradise. We hiked up and started the plot. On our way up, we tried to trouble shoot working in these plots when it's raining.
