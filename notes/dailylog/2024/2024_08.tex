We left again around 8:30 for AE10 and Paradise. It's cloudy and cold again for the second day in a row. We hiked all the way to paradise when we realized that it was very wet and slippery. We decided it wasn't safe to work so we hiked down and went back home. Avery, Britany and Mao went to core 6 new trees from the first plot we did because they weren't great when we first cored them. I took a nap and worked on my project. Mostly for the fall biochambers schedule and looked at the data Justin and Ken recorded.
Lizzie and Jonathan came to meet me at the house. We discussed gps points and how the fieldwork was going. I made fritata for dinner.

We left at 8:15. Cloudy and cold again. We went to meet Lizzie and Jonathan at Longmire campground at 8:30 and headed up to AE10. We forgot the box with all the data sheets which slowed us down a bit. We finished the plot around 10:30 and headed to Paradise. We hiked up and started the plot. On our way up, we tried to trouble shoot working in these plots when it's raining.

Going back to Vancouver! We left at 8:00, first stopped at UW to drop off the tree cores and dendrometers. Then we went to REI to buy hiking poles and bear box. We went to eat at the very cool Korean Restaurant Mao, Britany and I went when we stayed in Tacoma. \\
After, I picked up my back-pack that I found on marketplace. No wait at the border. I dropped the car off around 10pm.

I went for an apartment visit this morning. I arrived there and the landlord told me he would increase the rent by 500\$. I declined it. I was really upset. Then I went back to UBC to pick up Avery, Britany and Mao. We left around 11am. \\
A lot of wait at the border (something like 2 hours). We at Chipotle on the road and arrived at UW around 4pm. We picked up the new vest, increment borers and left for MORA. \\ 
On our way, we stopped at Costco, Safeway and Home Depot. 
We arrived at the campsite at 9pm. We set up the tent and went to bed

First day of the second trip! Pretty cloudy and cold\\
We left for Paradise around 8:30. We hiked up and managed to do more than half of the plot in during the day. The spikes and poles work really well.\\
We forgot the foot of the tent at Longmire, so we had to drive back there. We arrived at the campground around 6, made dinner and went to bed quite early.

Cold and cloudy again. We left at 8:20, but we had to buy a stove for the backpacking trip we will be doing on Thursday. We bought a Coleman. We went back to the campground because Avery forgot his rainjacket and it started to rain. We drove to Paradise\\
I found another way yesterday to get to the stand faster. It's 12 minutes longer to drive to the pulloff, but it's like 100 meters away from the stand. So we saved a lot of time. However, Mao didn't like it because we damaged the plants.\\
Mao got stung twice by wasps.\\
We finished at 1:30pm, walked back to the car and drove up to Paradise for the hike. Since I had a lot of work to do and because I was tired, I didn't do the hike with them.
