Came in at 8:30. Tree measurements at totem. Got to finish two blocks for diameter, but didn't start the third because the trees are covered in snow. Alex from Michaletz's lab came to get some sequoias. Then attended class. Came back in the lab, installed dendrometers and set up a bunch of cookies to get them scanned. Left at 6.
