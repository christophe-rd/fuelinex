Drove from Maine to Boston to pick up the cores. Nikita opened the doors for me and we left for Montreal with them at 5pm. Crossed the border around midnight.

Removed the tape from the cores. Sanded a first round, but the sand paper I had was not compatible so I could only do one round of rough grid sand paper.

Arrived at Totem at 9. Realized the trees haven't been watered in weeks. So I contacted Lizzie to confirm what I should do. I took VWC of all trees, then monitored budset because I suspect this drought has triggered early budset. I restarted the irrigation manually for 1 hour to give them a good amount. I was supposed to give all trees nutrients but because of all of that, we decided to postpone till we're back from Smithers.

I don't know yet who shut down the water, but most importantly when.

We were supposed to leave for Smithers today, but Mao is felling really bad, so Nolan and I will leave in the afternoon instead.
