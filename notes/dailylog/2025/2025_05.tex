Came in at 9:30 because I had errands to run this morning. Came back to the office and worked on cookies until 1pm. Then I wrote a bunch of emails and then went to Totem. Installed paper rulers on Quma, monitored phenology for pist and Quma, then monitored shoot elongation on paper only since I am alone today. Skipped prvi because it doesn't elongate much anymore and will start monitoring them every second week.
