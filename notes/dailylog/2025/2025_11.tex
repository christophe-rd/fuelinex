\textbf {Christophe, Tess and Nolan}
Came in at 9:30. Brought the xterra to totem with the shop vac. Nolan, Tess and I measured height for Bepa and the last bloc diameter for bepa. We brought back Pist B3 and placed them in 2 ovens because they are too big. We weighted all prvi and measured the red paint because the measurements from winter2025 were from the bottom of the mark, not the top, so I'll have to substract these measurements from those. Quma still need to be wheighted. Came back to the office, finished first proposal draft.
