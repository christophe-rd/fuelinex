Dear Dr. Michaletz,

I hope this email finds you well.

My name is Christophe Rouleau-Desrochers, and I am a first-year Master's student working with Lizzie Wolkovich. I previously completed my BSc at the Université du Québec à Montréal. My Master's research will explore how extended growing seasons in the context of climate change will affect different tree species. By conducting an 2-year experiment during which trees are subjected to warmer spring and autumn temperatures, I aim to investigate wether they will show growth increment and how these conditions will impact their phenology.

I am in the process of forming my committee, and I would like to have experts who can provide valuable insights for my project.

I think your research about ****. In addition to the intersection with growth-reproductive trade-offs, one of my research questions will be focused on how trees growing at different elevations will respond to climate change differently. 

I expect to have my first committee meeting in the fall, and hope you would consider joining my committee? I am happy to arrange a meeting to discuss the project in more detail and/or answer any questions you have in person or over email. 

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
Mao

Dear Sally,

I hope this email finds you well.

As you know, I am a first-year Master's student working with Lizzie Wolkovich. 

I previously completed my BSc at the Université du Québec à Montréal. My Master's research will explore how extended growing seasons in the context of climate change will affect different tree species. By conducting an 2-year experiment during which trees are subjected to warmer spring and autumn temperatures, I aim to investigate wether they will show growth increment and how these conditions will impact their phenology. I will also conduct a side experiment during which I will analyse tree ring data from a latitudinal provenance common garden study that was implemented at Harvard Forest 7 years ago.
