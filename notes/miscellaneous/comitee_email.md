Dear Dr. Michaletz,

I hope this email finds you well.

My name is Christophe Rouleau-Desrochers, and I am a first-year Master's student working with Lizzie Wolkovich. I previously completed my BSc at the Université du Québec à Montréal. My Master's research will explore how extended growing seasons in the context of climate change will affect different tree species. By conducting a 2-year experiment during which trees will be subjected to warmer spring and autumn temperatures in the first year, I aim to investigate whether they will show growth increment the following year. I will also conduct a side experiment where I will analyze tree ring data from a common garden study implemented at Harvard Forest 7 years ago; this will provide an opportunity to investigate how latitudinal provenance impacts trees' growth.

I am in the process of forming my committee, and I would like to have experts who can provide valuable insights for my project.

I think your research about plant physiology and how temperature affects their metabolism would be relevant to my projects. Since the trees in my experiment are going through different temperature regimes, I believe your insights would be truly helpful. 

I expect to have my first committee meeting in the Winter Term 2 (Jan-Apr 2025), and hope you would consider joining my committee. I am happy to arrange a meeting to discuss the project in more detail and/or answer any questions you have in person or over email. 

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
Christophe

Dear Sally,

Being in your teaching team in addition to going through your research has made me realize that your insights could be truly helpful for my projects. I believe your knowledge and experience in the ways forest trees will react to a changing climate could be more than relevant to my projects. 

I expect to have my first committee meeting in the Winter Term 2 (Jan-Apr 2025) and hope you will consider joining my committee. I am happy to arrange a meeting to discuss the project in more detail and/or answer any questions you have in person or over email.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your response.

Best wishes,
