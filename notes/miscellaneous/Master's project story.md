## Master's project story
We know that tree phenology has shifted earlier in the spring and later in the fall. Though we know the main driver of spring phenology to be temperature, the underlying mechanisms controlling fall phenology such as budset and leaf colouring are not as well known. 

A huge body of litterature have assessed what seems to be an easy statement to maker. By leafing out earlier and senescing later in the fall, trees should theoratically get extra days to grow during the season, a concept known as growing season extension. Logically, more days to grow should lead to increased carbon sequestration (higher productivity which could have huge impacts in the CC context. However, recent studies called this long-standing assumption into question. 

The ways growing season length can affect tree growth can be through different pathways which can be broken down into 2 main pathways: Internal and external drivers
