Decision on 5 September 2024. Some replicates from CSCF_nitro and WSWF_nitro are getting moved to other treatments. 

CSCF_nitro: 2 from B1, 1 from B2 and 2 from B3

WSWF_nitro: 3 from B1, 3 from B2 and 1 from B3. 

**Then , I'll need to take notes of which replicates get moved from which treatment.**

|     | CSCF | CSWF | WSWF | WSCF |
| --- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| B1  | +2   | +2   | +3   | +1   |
| B2  | +0   | +1   | +3   | +1   |
| B3  | +3   | +2   | +1   | +1   |
