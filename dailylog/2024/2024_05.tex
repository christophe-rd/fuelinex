Last few miles of my trip with Charlotte. For our last morning, we went to Billy Frank NWR. 41 species. Heard a Sora. 

We headed to Vancouver and set my things up in the afternoon.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Answered a few emails.
    \item Move back Segi that I removed previously to the greenhouse (warm spring treatements).
    \item Phenological monitoring for all species
    \item Paint Pist/Poba
    \item Measure shoot elongation Pist/Poba
    \item Water plants in CC
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Comments} Once I realized Segi were turning back from brown to green, I decided to bring them back to the experiment. Issue 12 on Git describes this.

\textbf{On methods for shoot elongation}: I always measure the center shoot of Pist. If there is no “central” shoot, I put a red dot on the measured shoot.

Painted Segi, Quma and Acma.
\paragraph{}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Took pictures of all Segi replicates as I want to keep track of their color change.
    \item Ken removed some dendrometers.
    \item Shoot elongation measurements for Segi, Quma and Acma (both in field and CC)
    \item Plants were rotated and watered in the chambers
    \item Worked 2 hours on irrigation and greenhouse arrangement.
    \item Started pruning Alru and weeding plants.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Comments} I was not feeling well this morning, so I came in at 11 and finished at 8:30. I realized pruning Alru, weeding the plants outside the greenhouse will take many hours. Dan and I will install automatic watering for trees outside the greenhouse.

\textbf{Christophe}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Moved Poba/Pist back to Totem
    \item Repoted Pist (all of them)
    \item Brought home and aped the end of roughly 100 rulers in the evening
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Comments}: Pist show root limitation. Will post pictures on git. Poba didn’t need to be repotted as they were already in 2-gal pots from the cuttings planted in March

Personal appointment to fix my car. So did mostly computer work. Emails, git issues, update data, etc. Came in for 3 hours in the afternoon to move around some plants and start weeding some from outside of the greenhouse.

\textbf{Christophe+Ken+Justin}
\begin{itemize}
    \item I bought tape.
    \item Taped the end of rulers.
    \item Shoot elongation measurements of:-Acne -Bepa -Poba -Prvi
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Comments}:
Before May 15, Hobo loggers were very much exposed to the sun. Therefore, they are heating which I assume influences the temperature sensor greatly. 

\textbf{On phenological monitoring of Pist}: Justin and I talked about it and we figure that for this species, from 1-2-3 are the shoot elongation and 4 is leaf emergence. This species elongates its shoots before the needles emerge. Justin will start an issue on this with upcoming pictures.

\textbf{Christophe+Justin}
I came in at 9:30 and Justin at 10
\begin{itemize}
    \item We did shoot elongation measurements for : -Quma  -Segi
    \item We took pictures of Segi, Quma and Pist for phenostages. Justin started an issue to figure out Segi phenostages.
    \item We watered and rotated Acma, Segi and Quma (in chambers).
    \item 
    \item I installed white paper with a half pot to protect Hobo loggers from getting sun heat.
    \item I installed a bird feeder.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Comments}
: left early for an appointment at ICBC.

\textbf{Christophe+Selena} 
I arrived at Totem at 11am. I had to go back to ICBC to get my Driver's license done. Selena arrived at Totem at 11am. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item We installed the paper rulers on Poba and Quma, both in the greenhouse and in the chambers.
    \item I had to buy more medical tape.
    \item I fixed a couple of leaks on the irrigation system .
    \item I saved the vegetable plants for Dan that he forgot in the truck.
    \item I weeded almost all the plants outside of the greenhouse. I finished at 8:30.

\textbf{Christophe}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
    \item Started a git issue on nutrient addition and answered a few emails.
    \item I removed 2 species from the chambers: -Quma -Acma
    \item I took the hobo loggers from those chambers as I want to install them at Totem. CC4 and CC1 are the ones removed.
    \item I placed all the Segi in the Walk-in chambers.
    \item Since the Subaru was very dirty from all the plants moved around, I cleaned it with a very bad vaccum that I found in the basement.
    \item First visitor at my bird feeder! Black-capped chickadee. I am very excited.
    \item I did the phenomonitoring for all trees.
    \item Put back drippers in Quma
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Took some time to learn Latex.
    \item I attended a talk on AI in Academia with Deirdre. Then we talked about a few questions I had regarding how to organize my data, the summer plans of the lab and other stuff.
    \item Then I chatted with Mao about our respective projects and how Mount Rainier is going to be like.
    \item Then I answered a few get issues and emails.
    \item 
    \item I changed the photoperiod in CCWalkin and set the remaining chambers to a constant 10 PAR and 15 degrees so they consume less energy.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Christophe + Ken}
I started marking the rulers and Ken arrived at 10. 
We finished marking the rulers at 12 and Ken went to get extra paper rulers because we forgot some trees on Friday. 
I talked with Dan, we will shrink the irrigation system, remove the compost and cut the grass around the greenhouse. 
I talked with Deirdre regarding the car battery 
A crow stole my granola bar :(
We finished taking the measurements around 3. I left as I had another apppointment at ICBC to register my car. 
I went to Costco during the night to buy a new car battery for the lab.

Started the day with some readings on growing season extensions. 
Added two quick notes in my obsidian slip box. I have been procrastinating on this and should be more consistent.
I answered emails to Lizzie, Deirdre and Mao regarding egret retreat, lab meeting, rbs retreat, etc.
Submitted my expenses to Lizzie
Lizzie agreed to the switch of car responsibility from Deirdre to me.

Went back to ICBC to register my car in BC.
Came back at Totem to clean the greenhouse so it's presentable for my presentation on Sunday
Last step of fixing the irrigation has been done with Dan in the morning. We 
I changed the Subaru's battery with the one I bought at Costco. I charged it so it's at maximum capacity with the car charger at Totem.
Met with Deirdre and Mao at 1pm to discuss:
-Egret retreat, -Mao's fieldwork, -General plan for the summer
I also mentionned to them that I thought of removing the Segi from the cahmbers because they've been there for a long time and because of the power outage that will happen the day after (Saturday). We agreed to remove them and place them back at Totem.
I moved the Segi back to Totem, and placed the irrigation back into the pots.
