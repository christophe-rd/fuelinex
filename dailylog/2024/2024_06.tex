Started the day by answering many emails. I answered the git issue on nutrient depletion which took my quite some time. I also finished installing the dendrometer. I did this just so I can check if they are all working.
Met with Mao at 3:30pm to discuss worklearn. We updated the offer and will send to Lizzie to confirm the info with her. 
I checked in with Dan regarding mildew on the Acne. They don't look great right now. He told me it can take up to a week before we see any improvement. Also, I thought we had the same problem with Prvi, but its just residu of the fongicide on their leaves.

Reifel Bird Sanctuary retreat. When we arrived, it was raining a bit, but it slowed down after 15 minutes. It was very quiet. Justin will do a slideshow of the pictures that were taken. I started working for real at 3pm. I added 2 notes to my slipbox! It was on the paper Fredi shared in git issue 14 about how to define stress in plants. I still need to cross-reference those. After this, I replied to a couple of emails that Lizzie and Christine sent me about my expense report. It took me about an hour to get this done.

I went to get the Subaru serviced. I also filled up the gas tank. While I was waiting, I finished what Christine told me to do to get my expense report done. I also registered to my classes in the fall. I talked to Deirdre on my way back to talk about my talk with Christine which was very difficult. We had an idea of getting a list of things over the course of the summer of things that Deirdre should teach us.
TO DO TODAY
\begin{itemize}
    \item Scan the receipts from yesterday (dominos and rbs)
    \item Scan the receipts from today (Chevron and Kon auto)
    \item Go back downstairs to grab the ziplock in the Xterra with the maintenance. Add maintenance to Git?
    \item Start a list of things Deirdre should pass on to us.
