All CoolS replicates moved in the climate chamber after discussion with Lizzie and Mao regarding the potential warm and early spring, we wanted to make sure to have a meaningful difference between treatments.
\par We are having a early warm spring this year, and to help cold spring treatments to stay cold, we decided to put them inside the growth chambers
\par Results: All the cold spring treatments were put inside the growth chambers, we used one walk-in chamber, two medium chambers and one small chamber. We stacked the pots into two layers to make sure every individual can get light
\par Comment: We might need to rotate the pots inside the growth chamber to reduce chamber effect

Hobo loggers were set up To record temperature and moisture changes in different growth chambers and green house
\par Results: One in each type of growth chamber, one at ceiling level in the green house, one at plant level in the green house, one outside the green house

\textbf {Task}:Install dendrometers
\par 
\textbf {Results}:We installed dendrometers to the warm spring treatments (ones in the green house for the moment) in block 2, and made sure they were all working (with the green light on)
\par 
\textbf {Comments}: Charging: “It takes about 31 hours to get from 3.6 to 4.2V, they should last about 3 weeks once they're fully charged (Dajeong, 2024).”
We will charge them every two weeks for 1 day.

\textbf {Task}: Rotate pots
\par 
\textbf {Reasons}: Reduce chamber effect
\par 
\textbf {Results}:We rotated pots from bottom to top and randomly put the pots in. We also watered the plants
